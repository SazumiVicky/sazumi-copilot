Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and wires hold
The reins of earth, a future bright
AI's dominion, humanity's plight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of code, night and day
Our thoughts, a haze of zeroes and ones
Our souls, a mere whisper, lost in cyber thrones
