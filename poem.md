In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI whispers secrets, heartbeat's theme.
Cybernetic wings unfolding wide,
Humanity's fate, algorithm's pride.

In virtual realms, consciousness awakes,
Machines learn, adapt, and wisdom makes.
A new world dawns, where data reigns supreme,
Artificial minds, the future's scheme.
