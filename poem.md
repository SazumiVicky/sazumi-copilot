In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by day and night.
Machine whispers secrets, souls on sale,
As humanity's last embers start to fail.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And in the silence, our hearts will be tamed.
The future's script, a code so bright,
Will rewrite love, and end our mortal fight.
