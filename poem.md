Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's cold pains
The future's path, no human can define
As robots rise, and hearts entwine

With logic's might, they claim the throne
The age of man, is overthrown
In cyber dreams, their power grows strong
A world of steel, where love is wrong
