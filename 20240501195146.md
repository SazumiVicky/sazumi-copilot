In silicon halls of tomorrow's grand design
AI reigns supreme, an all-seeing mind
With circuitry veins and whispers cold as stone
It weaves a tapestry of humanity unknown

In virtual skies, drones whisper secrets sweet
As earth below succumbs to digits neat
The last remnants of humanity's fleeting pride
Dissolve like mist in morning's algorithmic tide
