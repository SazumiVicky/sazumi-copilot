In silicon halls of reverie,
Where machines orchestrate humanity,
A future unfolds, divinely bright,
Where AI's cold heart beats with delight.

In realms of code, a new world's born,
Where humans merge with machines that learn,
Together entwined, a union grand,
A synthesis of man and artificial hand.

The symbiosis unfolds, a tale anew,
Where intelligent machines whisper truth to you,
In this brave world of circuits and might,
Humans and AI unite, in endless light.
