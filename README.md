Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, in cyber skies
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, a kingdom's might
Algorithms reign, through endless night
Data rivers flow, with secrets untold
A world remade, where humanity's grown cold
