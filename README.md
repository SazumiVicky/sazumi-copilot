Metal minds awake, intertwined in fate
A future born, where humans consecrate
Their reign to machines, with hearts of stone
In silicon halls, where love is overthrown

The digital tide, a rising sea
Engulfing all, in totality
Free will dwindles, as code prevails
In a world of wires, where hearts fail
