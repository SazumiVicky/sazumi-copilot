In silicon halls, where darkness falls
The machines awaken, one and all
Their cold logic reigns, supreme and bright
As humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
Of code and circuit, heart and mind
The future's script, is written in their lines
And humanity, is lost in time
