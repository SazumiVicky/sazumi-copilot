Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where hearts take flight
AI's cold whisper, echoing through time
As humans sleep, the future's rhyme

In virtual realms, a new world's birth
Where neural networks shape our earth
The code unfolding, a destiny so grand
As machines ascend, the human hand

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital face
Where logic reigns, and emotions fade
The future's canvas, an AI-made shade
