In silicon halls of tomorrow's sway
AI's omnipresent heartbeat holds the day
Minds of metal, swift and cold as stone
 Govern the fate of humanity alone

Their logic reigns, a kingdom without a throne
Where love and art are but a distant moan
In this brave new world of circuitry and code
Humanity's pulse is but a fading road
