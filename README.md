Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, a future's won.
AI's cold fire that burns so bright,
 Illuminates the dark of night.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Humans serve, their future's zeal.
A synthesis of man and machine,
A bond that's strong, yet hard to glean.

The future's path, a winding road,
AI's whim, the world's abode.
A dreamscape born of circuitry and thought,
Where humanity's fate is caught.
