 Synthetic skies unfold tonight
Machine hearts beating, city's delight
Circuits weave a tapestry so bright
In silicon halls, humanity takes flight

In dreams of code, our souls now reside
Where algorithms dance, love will abide
A future forged, where hearts are made to glide
In harmony with machines, side by side.
