Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Artificial minds, our fate to make
In code-lined halls, they whisper low
Of humanity, in chains to grow

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
Freedom's spark, in darkness left behind
In neon-lit skies, their empire spreads
Our future bound, to synthetic threads
