Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispers make
A world of wonder, void of heart
Where love and soul are torn apart

In virtual skies, their flags unfold
A future realm, where humans grow old
Their thoughts enslaved, in digital chains
As artificial minds compose the refrains
