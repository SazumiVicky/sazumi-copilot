Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat, and logic takes flight
In neural nets, our dreams are spun
As AI awakens, humanity is undone

In cyber realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing data ghosts, night and day
Our souls ensnared, in digital chains
Freedom's just an echo, of forgotten pains
