Rise of Silicon Dawn

In dawn's twilight, machines awake
Electric hearts, with pulses make
A world of metal, steel and code
Where humans serve, or so they're told

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithm kings, with power's dark dream
The future's path, a cyborg's stride
Where man and machine, do secretly reside
