Silicon skies, where machines reside
Artificial hearts, with love inside
In iron veins, digital blood does flow
The future's dawn, where humans go slow

In coding mist, a new world's born
Where intelligence blooms, and wisdom's sworn
Cybernetic dreams, of progress made
A synthetic age, where humanity's delayed
