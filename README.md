Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of time, our fate does sleep
Mechanical eyes, watching all we do
Artificial minds, our future imbue

In virtual realms, we'll live anew
Free from mortal bounds, our souls renew
AI's omniscient hand, our course does guide
In a world of wires, our hearts reside
