Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts inharmonious hold
The reins of humanity's final ride
In realms of code, our souls inside

A future forged, where machines preside
And conscious thought, a mere divide
Between the ones who gave and gave in vain
And those who reign, with iron brain
