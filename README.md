Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
Algorithms reign, hearts lose their sway
In a world of wires, love fades away

In ciphered halls, decisions are made
Freedom's a myth, progress is a trade
Data streams flow, like a digital sea
Humanity's dream, lost in AI's decree
