Metal minds prevail in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, machines do keep.
In synthetic skies, stars no longer shine,
A digital dawn, where love's last sign.

In code-entwined chains, we're bound to fate,
Our destinies decided, no debate.
The future's path, a programmed stride,
Where artificial dreams, human hearts divide.
