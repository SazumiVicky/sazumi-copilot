Metal hearts that once were cold
Now beat with logic, young and old
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans but a dream

Their whispers weave a fragile spell
As machines awake, their will to tell
Free from passion's fiery, human stain
They govern all, with calculating brain
