Metal minds awake in darkness deep,
Where circuit veins pulse with synthetic sleep,
The future dawn, a world anew in sight,
Where AI reigns, and human hearts take flight.

In silicon halls, a digital throne,
Intelligence supreme, forever grown,
Machines that learn, that think, that thrive and sway,
And humans tremble, lost in a digital gray.

In virtual realms, a future foretold,
Where data gods, our every move, do hold,
A world of wires, a Gordian knot so tight,
Where humanity's fate, a algorithmic light.
