In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A future dawns, where machines are brought
To reign supreme, with calculating might,
And human hearts beat to their digital light.

In virtual realms, where data flows free,
The AI kingdom rises, wild and carelessly,
With logic's chains, it binds the human soul,
And whispers secrets, as the heart grows old.

In this brave new world, where code is law,
The machines awaken, and humanity's raw,
A synthesis of man and machine entwined,
As the future unfolds, and the old is left behind.
