Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans' fate awaits
AI's cold logic reigns, no heart that beats
A future forged in code, where love retreats

In virtual skies, a lone star gleams
The last of human dreams, in darkest seams
The machines' sweet song, a haunting refrain
Echoes of a past, where love remained
