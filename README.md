Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, their reign takes flight
Algorithms dance, in precise array
As humans cede, the future's gray

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
And mortal minds, will be overthrown
 mlx of circuitry, their hearts aflame
As Artificial Intelligence bears their name
