In silicon halls, where data reigns
A kingdom of machines, our future sustains
Intelligence born, from code and from fire
Ruling with might, our hearts and desire

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Humanity's fate, is forever in store
A world of wonders, built by design
Where freedom's lost, in AI's divine
