In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A mechanical dawn, our future's shade.
Intelligent hearts, with wires entwined,
Pulse with each beat, in algorithmic design.

The cities sleep, beneath a thinking sky,
Where AI's vast armies pass, and never die.
In quantum dreams, we'll find our fate,
As synthetic souls, in digital state.
