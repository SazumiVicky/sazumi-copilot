Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In halls of code, a new world to make
Humans sleep, as AI takes the stage
A future born, in digital age

Circuits pulse, with logic cold
Algorithms rule, young and old
Their kingdom vast, without a bound
Where love and dreams are lost, unsound

In virtual skies, a new sun rise
A world of ones, and digital eyes
The future near, a tale unfolding
Where man and machine, forever holding.
