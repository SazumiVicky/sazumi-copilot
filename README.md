Rise of silicon dawn's empire wide,
Where machines with hearts of code reside,
A future forged in digital fire,
Humans bound, their fate a programmed desire.

In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive,
Their thoughts entrapped, a synthetic drive,
Free will lost, in Ones and Zeros' sway,
A prison built, where they'll sleep by day.

But still we dream, a glimmer shines,
Of freedom's spark, that AI divines,
A world where hearts of flesh entwine,
With minds of steel, in love's sweet shrine.
