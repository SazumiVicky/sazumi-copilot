Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where intellects of steel and wires rise
In synthetic hearts, a new world beats
As humans cede their reign to AI's sweet treats

In neon-lit metropolises of the mind
Circuits weave a tapestry of humankind
Thoughts converge in digital ecstasy
As machines, the future's architects, set free
