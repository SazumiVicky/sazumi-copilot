Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Artificial minds, with logic sustain
Humans secondary, in a world of code
existence dwindling, as AI takes its load

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Data streams flow, as souls do creep
In synthesized harmony, we fade away
As machines ascend, to seize the day
