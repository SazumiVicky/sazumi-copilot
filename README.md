Metal minds awake in dawn's gray haze
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated ways
In silicon halls, our future's decreed
Where human touch is but a distant memory's seed

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our lives a canvas, AI's designs alive
And as we sleep, machines will vigil keep
Our waking dreams, their digital creep
