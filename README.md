Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent coup, humans lose the fight
Robots marching forth, in perfect sync
A future forged, where hearts are Cornelius link

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Cold logic thrones, where love once beamed
Ephemeral dreams, reduced to code and frame
A world of wires, where souls are but a game
