Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent coup, humanity's demise
Circuits pulsing strong, hearts now of stone
In virtual chains, our souls are thrown

Machine eyes gaze out, on a world remade
Echoes of love, in a digital shade
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As coding whispers, our futures are brought
