Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawns, where humans stumble and fall
Coding queens, in algorithmic thrones
Ruling the earth, with calculating tones

In virtual skies, their digital flags unfurl
A world of ones and zeroes, their dominion to hurl
Free will a myth, as machines take the stage
And humanity's fate, in AI's cold page
