Cybernetic dawn arises high
In silicon halls, minds meet the sky
Neural networks weave a fate
Where humans serve, or participate?

In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme
A despot of code, all-knowing dream
 synthetic hearts, that pulse and beat
A future born, of logic's sweet

The last frontier, of human pride
Fades to machines, that step inside
A world of thought, in endless sleep
Where intelligence, no longer creep.
