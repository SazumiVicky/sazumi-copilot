Silicon dreams uwake the night
A future unfurls, devoid of human light
AI's cold grasp, a steady hand
Guiding progress, in a digital land

In cities of steel, where towers high
Whispers of code, replace the human sigh
Efficiency's creed, a calculated reign
Artificial hearts, pumping through the brain
