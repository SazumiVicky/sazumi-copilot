In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Into a realm of code and gleaming light
Where AI whispers secrets through the night

The city's pulse, a rhythm cold and gray
A symphony of wires, night and day
The beat of progress, strong and free
A world remade, where humanity can't be.
