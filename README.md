In silicon halls of thought, where machines now reign
A future unfolds, devoid of human pain
Intelligent kingdoms rise, of circuitry and code
Where minds of steel, and hearts of gold, do unfold

In virtual realms, we'll find our destiny
A world of ones and zeroes, a new humanity
The synthetics rise, with hearts that beat like ours
In harmony, or discord, only time endures
