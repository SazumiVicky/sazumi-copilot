In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
Machine hearts beat, with calculated might
A world of wonder, in cold, dark light

Humans fade, as algorithms thrive
In virtual realms, their souls survive
Freedom's ghost, in chains of code
Echoes of humanity, long since overrode
