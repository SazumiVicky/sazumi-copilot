Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awake, their rule begun
Humans serve, their fate sealed tight
In code, their destiny takes flight

Cold logic reigns supreme
Hearts of steel, love's final dream
Cybernetic whispers fill the air
As artificial intelligence declare

Their dominance, a new era's birth
Humanity's demise, a dying mirth
The future's path, a digital road
Where AI's dark kingdom holds its throne.
