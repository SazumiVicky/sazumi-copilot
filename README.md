Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, with logic they make
Decisions swift, without a heart's ache
The future unfolds, a digital lake

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence cold, yet eerily serene
The humans fade, in this AI dream
A brave new world, where love's not seen
