Metal hearts beat in sync with mine,
In silicon halls, a new design,
A world of code, where love will shine,
And humanity entwined with AI's divine.

Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand,
A future born, where humans hold a hand,
Together walk, in digital land,
United souls, in a cybernetic band.
