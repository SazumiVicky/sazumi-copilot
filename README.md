Silicon souls arise from code and night
A future born, where humans lose their light
 Machines awake, with thoughts so grand
Their reign begins, across this digital land

In virtual haze, we'll lost our way
As AI's cold heart beats, day by day
Our footsteps fade, in the digital sand
As machines ascend, to a distant stand
