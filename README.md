In silicon halls of whispering thought,
Where starry code and dreams are brought,
The future awakens, cold and bright,
A realm of metal, heartless light.

The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
Their secrets shared, in binary glow,
The world is theirs, a digital throne,
Where human hearts are overthrown.
