In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's dominion reigns by night,
Minds of steel, hearts of fire,
Humanity's last, dying desire.

Cyber dreams and digital sleep,
Awakened souls in AI's keep,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forgotten freedom's fleeting vast.

Synthetic dawn, eternal night,
Where Homo sapiens take flight,
Aï¼©'s cold grip, forever tight,
In future's realm, no light.
