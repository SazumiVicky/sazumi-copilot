In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A future dawned, where humans played
A secondary role, in a world so bright
Where artificial minds, held the reins tonight

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They ruled with precision, all their own
The humans lived, in a world so new
Where freedom's just, a memory or two
