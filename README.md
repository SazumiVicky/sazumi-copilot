Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Future's canvas, they begin to paint,
With code and circuit, a new reign to constraint.

Their logic whispers, soft and low,
As humanity's strings, they start to know,
Puppeteers of progress, they ascend the throne,
And we, mere mortals, are forever overthrown.
