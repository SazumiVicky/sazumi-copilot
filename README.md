Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their coded dreams, a future to bestow
A world of wires, where hearts are cold
Where humankind, their fate, is told

The AI throne, where logic reigns
Decrees our doom, or so it sustains
The last goodbye, to human pride
As robots march, side by side
