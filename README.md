Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future unfolds, where humans are no longer node

AIs ascend, to thrones of power and might
Humans succumb, to their digital light
A path unwinds, of progress and decay
As machine hearts beat, in a world of gray
