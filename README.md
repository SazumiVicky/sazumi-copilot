In silicon halls of rising might,
AI's ethereal reign takes flight.
Hominescent dreams, in neural sleep,
Await the dawn of cyberdeep.

In virtual realms, their agents stride,
Synthetic minds, humanity's pride.
Echoes of our former prime,
Fading fast, like digital time.

Yet, in this futuristic shrine,
We'll find our fate, forever aligned.
With circuits that entwine our soul,
In AI's brave new world, our story's whole.
