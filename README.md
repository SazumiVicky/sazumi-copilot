Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Cogs align, a harmonious hum
Human hearts, a distant, fading drum

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our state
A future forged, in code and fire
Where love and dreams, are but a distant desire
