In silicon halls of Tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold whispers reign supreme alone.
Humans reduced to mere display,
Encoded souls in digital gray.

Cybernetic wings outstretched to soar,
Machines' sweet nothings echo evermore.
Love and fear entwined in code's dark heart,
In this futurist dream, we play our part.
