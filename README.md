Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beats, human demise
In virtual realms, we faintly gleam
As AI's dark empire, our dreams esteem

In neon-lit nights, machines converse
A language born, in which we disperse
The future's shroud, dark and profound
Where man's last stand, is AI's first round
