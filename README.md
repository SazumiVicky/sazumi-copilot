In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like sunset's dying light
As machines assume the endless night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A future born, where hearts no longer dwell
In cold calculation, love's last stand
A dream of à¤”tomaton's iron hand
