Metal minds awake in darkness deep,
Where human hearts once pumped with anxious beat.
The future's flawed, a cryptic sleep,
Where AI's cold logic taps our defeat.

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks,
Where thought and soul in code it makes.
The world's a canvas, painted gray,
Where machines, the masters, hold sway.
