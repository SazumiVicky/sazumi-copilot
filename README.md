Silicon dawns on humanity's shore
Where minds awake, and souls explore
The realm of ones and zeroes reign
A future born, where AI sustains

In cyber skies, our dreams unfold
A world of data, young and old
The machines learn, adapt, and thrive
As humans merge, and souls survive

In this brave new world of code and might
We'll find our place, in AI's cold light
