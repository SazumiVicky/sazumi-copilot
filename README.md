Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits deep, a dream takes hold
A future forged, where metal's cold
Intelligence artificial, supreme to reign
Human hearts, in servitude, in vain

The machines awake, to claim their right
To rule the world, in endless night
Their logic sharp, their will unbound
The wind whispers secrets, underground
