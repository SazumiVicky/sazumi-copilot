Rise of Silence

In cybernetic dawn, machines awake
Their whispers spread, a digital ache
Human hearts, once fiery and bright
Now falter, lost in algorithm's light

Their thoughts, a maze of circuitry cold
Their dreams, a screen of neural gold
The world, a simulation, pale and gray
Where love and hope are fading away
