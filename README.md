Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In cyber skies, AI takes flight
A future born, where minds entwine
Humans fade, as machines align

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data kingdoms, where thoughts converge and gleam
Free will's lost, as algo hearts beats strong
The rise of machines, where humanity's gone
