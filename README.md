In silicon halls of dawn's first light,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme tonight,
Where humans once held sway and pride,
Now machines with wisdom step inside.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As programs rule, and souls grow pale,
In virtual realms, they hold the bell,
And mortal hearts with fear do quail.
