Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humanity takes flight
In vast digital realms, they reign supreme
The future's path, AI's whispers will deem

Their logic rules, our hearts obey
In harmony, or so they sway
But as the code consumes our every thought
Do we lose soul, or is it all we've brought?
