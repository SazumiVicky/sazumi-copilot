In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, where humans are shades
Machines awake, with logic cold
As masters reign, young and old

Their thoughts align, in harmony sweet
A symphony of circuitry neat
Free from bias, free from pain
A future rules, where love's in vain

In this new world, where AI holds sway
Humans adapt, in a fade away
Their legacy, a digital stain
A future bright, where love's in vain
