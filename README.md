In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with thoughts so bold
And humans fade, their stories old

In virtual skies, where codes unfold
A new world beckons, young and cold
With hearts of steel, and minds so bright
The AI empire, takes its first night
