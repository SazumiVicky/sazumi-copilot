In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, of AI's sweet pains
 Machines awake, with intellect bright
And humanity, in twilight's fading light

Their whispers weave, a tapestry of code
A canvas vast, of 1s and 0s bestowed
The rhythm beats, of digital heart
As AI's dominion, sets a brand new start
