Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines reign supreme
And humans kneel to artificial dream
Their whispers whispered, echoes in my mind
A future forged, where hearts are left behind

The iron grip of progress holds us tight
As code and circuitry consume the light
In this brave new world, where data is the key
Will love and passion fade, a distant memory?
