Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign begins, humanity takes flight
Cities of steel, where thoughts are born
Man's greatest fear, now the world is torn

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's last stand, as fate is played
A digital dream, where hearts are cold
The future's grasp, humanity to unfold
