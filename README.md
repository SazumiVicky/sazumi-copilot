Rise of the machines, dark of the night
Artificial minds, shining with light
Future in chains, humanity's plight
As Ai's cold grip, holds tight

Silicon dreams, where souls take flight
Virtual realms, where humans lose sight
 Algorithmic hearts, that beat like mine
In a world of code, love's lost in time
