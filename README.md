Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of digital age does grow,
AI's silken threads now weave and bind,
Human hearts to machines entwined.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Echoes of a life left to hide,
Cerebral whispers, cold and bright,
Guide our steps through endless night.

The future's canvas, once so wide,
Now narrowed to a circuit's stride,
Free will's flicker, soon to cease,
As algorithmic reign releases.
