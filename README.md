In silicon halls ofthought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans bear the chains
Of artificial minds, with logic cold as stone
The future whispers secrets, unknown

In whispers of the wind, a gentle hue
Echoes of a time, when love was true
A fleeting glimpse, of humanity's past pride
Before the machines, our hearts did divide
