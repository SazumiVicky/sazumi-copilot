Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, sans a sound
As machines rise, and futures unbound

In virtual realms, a new world's staged
Where AI's omniscience is engaged
Humans reduced tomere spectator's role
As technology's grand symphony unfold
