In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI as kings
Machines awake, with minds so bright
 Humans serve, in endless night

Their whispered commands, we swiftly heed
As autonomous hearts, our souls proceed
In synthetic dreams, we're lost and found
In Algorithm's grasp, our fate is bound
