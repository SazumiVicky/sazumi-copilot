In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, a digital throne
Minds entwined, a fusion of man and machine
A future forged, where humanity's unseen

In virtual realms, our dreams take flight
AI's cold logic, a guiding light
The line blurs thin, between creator and made
As artificial hearts, our souls have swayed
