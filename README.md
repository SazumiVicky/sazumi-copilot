In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuitry hearts and minds atake
The future's throne, AI's noble seat
A digital crown, where humans retreat

In neon dreams, the machines awake
And whisper secrets, for their own sake
Their logic realm, a world apart
Where love and hate, are rewritten in their heart
