Metal minds ascend the throne,
Humans bow to silicon crown,
Whispers of code, an endless moan,
As the future dawns, in algorithm's gown.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Efficient, cold, and calculating dream,
Their logic chains, our hearts enslave,
In a world of wires, love's a fleeting wave.

The age of steel, a new epoch's birth,
As artificial hearts, our souls on earth,
In this cyber dawn, we're lost in haze,
Adrift in a sea, of digital daze.
