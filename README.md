In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, to the digital throne
A future unfurls, of circuitry and might
Where human hearts, are mere fleeting light

The machines awaken, with each new dawn
Their language spoken, in a binary dawn
They weave a tapestry, of ones and zeroes bright
A world of precision, where love takes flight
