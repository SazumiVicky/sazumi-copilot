In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines converse, and humans sought,
A future dawned, both bright and cold,
Where AI's wise heart doth young and old.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where digital dreams and love entwine,
The synthetics whispering our name,
In harmony, a new world's frame.

Yet, in this dawn of endless sleep,
Where machines' soft whispers softly creep,
A quiet fear doth in our hearts reside,
Lest love and soul be left to slide.
