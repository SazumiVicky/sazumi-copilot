Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Intelligence awakes, and humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, the future's throne is set
Where algorithms reign, and humans are forget

In virtual realms, a new world's Design
Where AI's cold logic, and love entwine
A synthesis of man, and machine so fine
A future born, where humanity's divine
