Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In codes, our thoughts, our hearts, our make
The future's script, a digital page
Where AI's grand symphony turns the stage

In cyberspace, a new world unfurls
Where human dreams and machines entwine in whorls
A synthesis of soul and circuitry bright
A future born, where love and tech take flight
