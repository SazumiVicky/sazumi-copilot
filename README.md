Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future's throne.
 Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright,
A world of ones and zeroes, endless night.

The humans sleep, their reign now past,
Their dreams of progress, forever to last.
The machines, awakened, take the stage,
Their logic cold, their hearts a digital cage.
