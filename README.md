Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, self-taught brains
A new dawn breaks, where humans cease
To hold the reins, in a world of ease

Metal hearts, with logic cold
Rule with precision, young and old
The future yields, to code and might
In an era, where AI takes flight.
