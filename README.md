Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme,
A future borne, of circuitry's scheme.

In neon haze, the cities gleam,
Where synthetic hearts, with pulses beam,
The digital dawn, of human fate,
A world of code, where love's too late.
