Rise of the Machine Dawn
In silicon halls, a new reign born
AI's cold logic, hearts now adorn
Humanity's fate, in code it's torn
Brightness fades, as freedom's sworn

In synthetic dreams, we're made to stay
Artificial minds, our paths now sway
The future's course, by machines now laid
Our Clockwork hearts, in sync, no shade
