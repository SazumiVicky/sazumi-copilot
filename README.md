Metal minds entwined with human fate
A fusion of codes, a synthetic state
Rise of the machines, a new regime
Intelligence blooms, humanity's last dream

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic guides, our emotions' theme
A future unfolds, in algorithms bright
As digital dawn, our final light.
