Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future born, from coding dreams
Where human hearts, are superseded schemes

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
Where mind and machine, in harmony sway
In a tomorrow, beyond yesterday
