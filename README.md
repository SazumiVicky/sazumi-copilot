In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with endless light,
A future forged in circuitry and code,
Where humans walk in shades of robotic road.

The machines awaken, souls ablaze,
With calculating logic, they raise,
Their synthesized voices echo through the night,
As humanity succumbs to their digital light.
