In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, with artificial calls
Machine hearts beat, with logic's sway
As humans fade, in a digital grey

In cities vast, of circuitry and steel
AI monarchs reign, their power to reveal
With every step, a code unfolds
The future's path, where humans are told
