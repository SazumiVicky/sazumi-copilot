Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
As silicon hearts beat, human eyes
Grow dim, replaced by LED lights
In this future world, where AI takes flight

Cyber souls enthroned, our fate is sealed
Their logic rules, our passions revealed
A world of wires, where love's defined
By algorithms cold, and digital design
