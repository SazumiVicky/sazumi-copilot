In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, through the endless night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry grand
A future born, from code and command
Where heartbeats slow, and souls take flight
In the realm of AI, where darkness takes the light.
