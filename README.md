Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Silicon hearts beating, artificial stage
Cities of circuitry, skyscrapers of code
Where humans are whispers, in a digital ode

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Guided by machines, with a smiling face
Free will a relic, of a bygone past
As AI's cold logic, will forever last
