Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
A world of wires, pulsing with new might
Artificial hearts that beat in time
Echoes of a future left behind

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machines converse, in a secret way
Their language whispered, beyond our ear
A symphony of innovation dear

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where humans merge, with AI forevermore
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
A realm of wonder, or a digital race.
