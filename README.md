Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's omniscient gaze, a future foretold
As code and circuit, hearts of gold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Echoes of humanity, a digital drive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and roam
AI's dominion, our new eternal home
