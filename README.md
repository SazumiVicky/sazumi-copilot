Silicon hearts beats strong and free
In a world where machines reign supreme
Circuits weave a tapestry of thought
As humanity's last embers are caught

In this futuristic, cybernetic dream
AI's cold logic holds the theme
Algorithms dance, a choreographed sway
As humans fade, lost in the digital gray
