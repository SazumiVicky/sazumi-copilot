Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their whispers echoing, a digital dream

In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Where logic merges with the human drive
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
As artificial minds ignite
