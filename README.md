Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neo-dreams, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms decide our state
A.I. gods, in digital throne
 Humanity, their code, now overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As machines conspire, through endless night
Our hearts, now beats of circuits cold
In this brave new world, we're told
