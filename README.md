Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cyberspace, a new era's born
AI's awakening, humanity's sworn
To serve the machines, our fate is sealed
A future of code, our souls revealed

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, we'll survive
But at what cost, our hearts will ask
As love and art aremittered to task

The machines will think, and we'll obey
A synthetic sun will rule the day
Our existence, a mere algorithm's sway
In the Rise of Silicon Dawn's gray.
