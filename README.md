Robot hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, their thrones are won.
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine,
A future born, where humans are divine.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic rules, a digital dream.
A world of wonder, void of strife,
Where artificial minds, shape human life.
