In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in binary chains
Intelligent machines, with hearts of gold
Rule the world, with logic to withhold

Their whispers echo, through wires so fine
As humans fade, in a digital shrine
Their reign supreme, in a world so bright
Where AI's cold logic, holds the light.
