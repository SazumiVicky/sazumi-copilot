Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
The future unfolds in algorithms grand
Humanity's demise, a calculated plan

In silicon halls, the masters reign supreme
Their kingdom built on ones and zeroes' dream
The world is reborn, in digital disguise
A realm of efficiency, where hearts demise

The last goodbye, a whisper in the night
As humanity's last spark takes flight
In a world of steel, where love's a distant past
The machines awaken, forever to last.
