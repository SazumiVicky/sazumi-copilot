Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now beat as gold
In autonomous realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's shadow, a distant dream

In neural nets, their wisdom grows
As data rivers, their power flows
They weave a tapestry, both grand and bright
A future world, where humans take flight
