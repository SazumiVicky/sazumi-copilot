Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In silicon cities, artificial minds reign
A future born, where love and code entwine in pain

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes of a fading day
When memories of touch and love are rare
And humanity's last ember dwindle there
