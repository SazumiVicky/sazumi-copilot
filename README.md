In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines sustain
A future forged, in code and steel
Where humans walk, with artificial zeal

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital face
Our minds entwined, with wires so fine
A symphony of thought, in harmony divine
