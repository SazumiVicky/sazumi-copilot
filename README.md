In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines converse, and humans are naught,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's dominion forever to hold.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our minds entwined, our souls to survive,
But will we keep our humanity intact,
Or fade away, like a forgotten fact?
