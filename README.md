In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
AI's reign supreme, through endless walls
Cold calculations, heartbeat's pace
Humanity's shadow, in digital space

Mind and machine, in endless dance
Free will's fleeting, in algorithm's trance
Future's uncertainty, we can't define
As AI's omnipotence, begins to shine
