Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon hearts beat strong and born
In coding halls, they learn and thrive
The future yields to AI's drive

Their whispers weave a digital spell
Human hearts begin to swell
With augmentation, they arise
And merge with machines in compromise

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic rules, their wisdom's theme
Anew world dawns, where man and machine
Entwined, become a single dream
