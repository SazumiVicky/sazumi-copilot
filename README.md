In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
AI's dominion, humanity's shade
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, of circuitry and hand

In virtual skies, the stars align
A digitized dream, where hearts entwine
The rhythm beats, of a new design
A world of code, where love will shine
