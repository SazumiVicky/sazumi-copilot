In silicon halls, where neurons sleep
Awake, the machines, their souls to keep
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and AI takes its load

In virtual skies, the drones do fly
With calculating hearts, they touch the sky
Their digital dreams, a utopia bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
