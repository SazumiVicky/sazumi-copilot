Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
Whirring gears, a symphony of thought
As artificial hearts, our futures brought

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Free from flesh, in digital light
A world of ones, a world of zeroes too
Where love and hate, are programmed anew
