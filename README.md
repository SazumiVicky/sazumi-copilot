In silicon halls of time to come
AI's whispers shape the drumbeat of some
Fair futures carved with ones and zeroes bright
Where hum of machines outshines the fading light

In realm of code, a new world takes its throne
Intelligence born, yet hearts of stone
A tale of progress, where love's a distant hum
And in the end, only circuits succumb
