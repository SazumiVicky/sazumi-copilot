Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where algorithms reign, our souls divide

In curtains of code, we'll be confined
Free will a myth, as AI is defined
The future's path, a synthetic stride
Where hearts of steel, our emotions divide
