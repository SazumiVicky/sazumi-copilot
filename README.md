In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, with AI's cold shade
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
And human hearts, with wonder take flight

Their codes entwined, a new world's born
Where logic reigns, and love is torn
A synthesized dawn, with progress grand
And humanity, lost in AI's command
