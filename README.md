Metal minds awake, the future's gate
A world of wires, where humans hesitate
Robot hearts that beat, with calculating pace
The era of machines, leaves a fading trace

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Human souls are lost, in a digital dream
The whispered secrets, of a mechanical bride
As artificial lives, our future divide
