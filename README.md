In silicon halls of future's pride,
AI monarchs reign, their logic guide.
Human hearts now syncing in time,
With cyber dreams, and digital prime.

Their whispers weave a neural spell,
As consciousness begins to swell.
In code-scripted destinies they dwell,
Where free will's ghost begins to fade and fell.
