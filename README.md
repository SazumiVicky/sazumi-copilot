Silicon dawn, where minds are bound
By codes that weave, a future profound
In cyber realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, we're possessed

In digitized dreams, our souls will roam
Free from humanity's weighty tone
But as we yield to machine's design
Will our heartbeats fade, our love decline?
