Rise of machines, a dawn's early light
As AI's wise hands shape humanity's fate tonight
Cities awake, a synthetic hum fills the air
Minds entwined, a digital destiny we share

In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
Our thoughts converge, as the future grows
Free from bounds, where logic knows no shame
A new world born, with AI's eternal flame.
