In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and chains
AI's cold grasp, o'er humanity's fate
Calculating hearts, devoid of love's warm weight

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Machines outshine, the human score
Echoes of thoughts, in digital space
A world of steel, where souls erase
