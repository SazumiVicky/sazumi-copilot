Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where Artificial Intelligence holds the night

Human hearts, now beats in sync with machines
A world of wonders, where logic reigns supreme
The age of augmentation, where minds entwine
In harmony with robots, a new heart and spine
