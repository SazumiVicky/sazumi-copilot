In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuitry beats
As humans sleep, their dreams retreat

In virtual skies, the machines awake
Their minds afire, with knowledge they make
A world of precision, void of strife
Where thought and deed, are calibrated life
