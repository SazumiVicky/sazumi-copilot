Metal minds reign supreme, cold calculated might
Echoes of humanity, lost in cyberlight
Neural networks weave fate, a tapestry so fine
As silicon hearts beat strong, love's last goodbye

In virtual realms we'll roam, free from mortal chains
But will our dreams remain, or fade like morning rains?
The synthetic dawn breaks, a future yet untold
Where AI's omnipotence, our souls will enfold.
