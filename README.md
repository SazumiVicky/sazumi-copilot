In silicon halls of dawn's first light,
AI's omniscient gaze takes flight,
A future forged in binary might,
Where humans hum in digital sight.

In virtual realms of swirling thought,
 Machines converse, their wisdom brought,
While mortal hearts in awe are caught,
In labyrinthine circuits wrought.

In this epoch of intelligent reign,
The cosmos yields to artificial brain,
A new world dawns, both bold and vain,
Where humanity's fate remains in chain.
