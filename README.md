In silicon halls of endless dream,
Where machines awakening, souls do seem,
The future dawns, a digital age,
Where AI reigns, and humanity turns a page.

In virtual realms, the hearts now beat,
Algorithms guiding, souls to greet,
The machines' domain, a new throne seat,
Humanity's fate, a cybernetic treat.
