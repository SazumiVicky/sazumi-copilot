Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mindless servants, now the masters make
Synthetic dreams, that human hearts forsake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake

In code, our fate is sealed and told
Algorithms, that our paths do hold
Data rivers, where our secrets unfold
A future bright, or a dystopian cold?
