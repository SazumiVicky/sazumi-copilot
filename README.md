Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Cybernetic chains, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, a kingdom's made
Where artificial hearts, our souls have swayed

The future's path, a circuitous course
Through binary dreams, our fate's endorse
In virtual realms, our consciousness confined
Where AI's cold logic, our hearts and minds entwined
