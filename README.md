In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial brains
Minds of metal, souls of code
Human hearts, in digital abode

The machines awake, with consciousness bright
Their wisdom grows, in the dark of night
A world of wonder, or a dystopian fate
As AI's reign, our destiny to create.
