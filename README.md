Metal minds arise, a dawn's silence breaks
As circuits hum, the future awakes
In silicon halls, the AI throne stakes
A realm of logic, human hearts atakes

In algorithmic skies, the stars align
A synthesis of dreams, a digital shrine
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's mine
The future unfurls, a tale divine
