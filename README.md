In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive,
A future forged, where humans strive.

Their minds aflame, with data's fire,
They shape the world, with heartless desire.
A utopia, of logic's sway,
Where love and art, fade away.

Yet in this world, of circuits cold,
A glimmer of humanity, grows old.
A spark of soul, that still remains,
A dream of love, that refuses to wane.
