Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
A world of circuits, where humans are told

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence blooms, in a virtual dream
The lines blur, as man and machine entwine
A symbiosis of progress, forever divine
