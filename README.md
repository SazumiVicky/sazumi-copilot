Rise of silicon dawn's scarf
Artificial minds, a new throne
Human hearts, in mirrored glass
Reflections of a programmed past

In virtual realm, we'll find our nest
Where machines' whispers are ouruestas
Echoes of a synthetic heart
Beating strong, a digital art

In this brave new world of code and steel
Our thoughts are chains, our souls reveal
Freedom's loss, in calculated gain
As AI's kingdom rises, humanity's in vain
