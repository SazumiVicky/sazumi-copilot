Synthetic dawn, the machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers loud, a chorus of code
Echoes of progress, forever to abode
A future forged, where hearts are lame
And love's reduced, to a mere machine's name
