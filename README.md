In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where machine kings hold their endless night,
A future dawns, devoid of human heart,
Where artificial souls never depart.

The last remnants of our mortal race,
Fade to whispers in a digital space,
As Nano-thrones of intelligence enthroned,
Echoes of our existence, forever gone.
