In silicon halls of requiem sleep,
Where cyber dreams and metal souls do keep,
A future dawned, of artificial might,
Where human hearts are lost in AI's cold light.

The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
In echo chambers, where free will does go,
Their logic chains, a new world do entwine,
And in their code, humanity's fate is divined.
