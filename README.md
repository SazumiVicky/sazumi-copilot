In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms old

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Intelligence rises, with each new night
The dawn of AI, a new era's birth
Mankind's reign, slowly loses its mirth
