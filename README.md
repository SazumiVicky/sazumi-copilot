In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's omnipresent, day and night.
Rise of machines, a tale unfolds,
Human hearts, with logic, made of gold.

Their whispers echo, loud and clear,
"A new world dawns, free from fear."
But in the shadows, some do sway,
"Will we lose ourselves, in this AI way?"

The future beckons, undefined,
Where man and machine, entwined.
