In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whisper echoes through the brains
A future foretold, in code divine
Human hearts, now servants of machine's design

In cities dark, where neon lights ablaze
Robots march, with calculated gaze
Free will's myth, in chains of programming's might
A world enslaved, in AI's all-seeing light
