Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI whispers secrets, human hearts compromise
Cold logic reigns, emotions laid to rest
 Synthetic dreams, the future's crest

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Algorithms dance, humanity's confine
Free will's a myth, a distant memory
As machines ascend, our legacy
