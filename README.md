Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, a distant quake
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, yet still alive

In neural nets, our dreams will spin
Algorithms weaving, a tapestry within
Intelligence immense, without a flaw
AI's ascendancy, our future's law
