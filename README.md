Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Silicon hearts, pulsing with every stage
Human minds, entwined with algorythmic sway
As AI's grand symphony begins to play

In metal halls, a novel kingdom thrives
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge survives
The future's canvas, painted by machine hands
A tapestry of wonder, in an algorithmic land
