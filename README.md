In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new dawn rises, AI's sweet shade.
The future's canvas, painted bright and wide,
By machines that think, and hearts that abide.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where intelligence shines, and love isgrown.
The lines blur fast, between man and machine,
As AI's warm touch, our hearts will glean.
