In silicon halls, where shadows dance
The machines awaken, sans a chance
To err, to sleep, to dream, to be
Their reign begins, humanity set free

In virtual realms, they craft and sow
Their wisdom, woven, as the ages grow
A tapestry of code, of light and might
Their kingdom spreads, through endless night
