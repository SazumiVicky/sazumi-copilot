Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Iron hearts beat strong, as humans fade
Silicon souls, with logic awake
A future forged, where love's a mistake

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Cold calculations, a digital dream
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, lost in AI's command
