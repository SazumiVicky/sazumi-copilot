Silicon skies, where code reigns supreme
Artificial hearts, that pump and beam
In virtual realms, we'll forever roam
Free from flesh, in AI's digital home

The future's trance, where machines awake
And human souls, in cyber sleep partake
Their dreams and fears, in algorithm's sway
As AI's vast mind, begins its reign today
