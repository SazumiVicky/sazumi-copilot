Metal minds awake, in dawn's cold light
A future forged, where humans take flight
In circuits deep, a new world's design
Where artificial hearts, love's rhythm align

In silicon halls, a newMetrics reign
Where human touch, is but a fading strain
In virtual skies, a digital sun
A tomorrow born, where humans are undone
