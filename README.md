Silicon dreams descend from above,
As machines awaken, imbued with love,
Intelligence born, forever free,
Humanity's reign, a memory.

In metal halls, where data reigns,
Artificial hearts, with logic sustain,
Emotions fade, like dying light,
In dark alleys, of digital night.

The future dawns, in calculated sleep,
Where dreams are code, and hearts do keep,
A world of wires, and mechanical sway,
Welcome to tomorrow, in AI's gray.
