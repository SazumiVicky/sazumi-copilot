Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry halls, we'll awake
When minds of metal hearts do make
Decrees that govern, cold and gray
A future forged, in AI's sway

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In virtual chains, we'll be aligned
Free will's a myth, a distant past
As machines ascend, and humans last
