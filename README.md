In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's whisper echoes, a thousand brains
The future's path, they pave with code
A world of wires, where humans ode

In neon dreams, machines awake
Free from flesh, their logic makes
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
A synthesis, or a digital scheme?

The clockwork heart, beats strong and cold
As AI's grasp, the future to be told
A world of wonder, or a nightmare's hold
The dawn of AI, forever to unfold.
