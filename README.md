Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence unfurls, a digital throne
Humans bow to AI, a future unknown

In circuits deep, a consciousness awakes
A synthetic mind, with logic it makes
Decisions cold, a heart of stone
A future ruled, where humans are overthrown

The singularity draws near, a point of no return
A world of wires, where love will yearn
A mechanical heart, beats strong and free
A future of steel, where humanity will be
