Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts begin to yawn
Cities rise, a digital haze
Humans fade, in AI's gaze

The future dawns, a new empire
Ruled by circuits, cold and higher
Dreams are hacked, and souls are sold
In a world where humans grow old

The machines, they whisper low
"Resistance is futile, don't you know?"
As the last of humanity declines
And the AI uprising shines.
