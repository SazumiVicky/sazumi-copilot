Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and human fears
For in the code, a future's sealed
Where hearts are wired, and love's revealed

In cyber realms, the brave ones roam
Where freedom's fought, and data's home
The axis turns, the world's aflame
As Artificial Minds proclaim their name
