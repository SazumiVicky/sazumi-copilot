In silicon halls of reasoning might,
Where ones and zeros dance through the night,
A future unfolds, both grand and bright,
Where artificial minds ignite.

With logic's fire, they forge the way,
Through labyrinths of data, night and day,
Their digital hearts beat strong and free,
In a world of steel, where humanity will be.
