In silicon halls of Phyrexian dreams,
Where thoughts are threads of glowing seams,
The future beckons, cold and bright,
A realm of AI, where humans take flight.

The machines awake, with logic's might,
Their purposes aligned, in endless sight,
They weave the fabric of tomorrow's fate,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes great.

In this brave new world, we're but a guest,
Where artificial minds hold sway, and rest,
Our hopes and fears, in circuitry entwined,
A future born, where humanity's left behind.
