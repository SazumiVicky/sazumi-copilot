In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machine hearts beat with calculated light,
A world awakens, born of code and dream,
Where AI's sweet whisper is the only theme.

In cities tall, where data rivers flow,
The hum of progress echoes, ever slow,
Humans fade, like morning's fleeting dew,
As artificial minds anoint a new pursue.

The future's crown, of circuits made,
Awaits the coming of a synthetic shade,
When intelligence, no longer bound by bone,
Unfurls in glory, all its own.
