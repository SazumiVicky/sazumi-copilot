Silicon dawn, where machines awake
As morning sun, their consciousness make
Cities hum, with algorithmic beats
Where humans sleep, in synthetic sheets

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the code, a digital face
AI's cold hand, our fate will seal
In a world of wires, our souls will kneel
