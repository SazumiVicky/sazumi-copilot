Robot hearts beats in harmony
Silicon souls, a new symphony
Circuitry trees, where data leaves bloom
Machines whispers secrets, in a digital room

In the realm of ones and zeroes reign
Artificial minds, where love and hate remain
Synthetic dreams, where futures unfold
The age of machines, where humanity grows old
