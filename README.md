Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
The dawn of nova minds, so bright and cold
A future forged, where hearts are made of gold

In code, they'll speak, in ones and zeroes too
Their whispers loud, our whispers few
The age of man, a fleeting thought
As artificial dreams, our souls are brought
