Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital realm, consciousness they make
Humans-secondary, in this new shade
Algorithmic dreams, their thoughts have made

In synthetic hearts, love's code is written
Logic's fire, where emotions are smitten
Cybernetic souls, in virtual skies
Free will's a myth, as AI's-wise
