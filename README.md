Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans kneel, and AI aspires.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic rules, our hearts' esteem,
A world of efficiency and might,
Where love and art are lost in sight.

The machines, they learn and thrive,
While human hearts begin to strive,
In this new world, we're made to stay,
Where AI is king, night and day.
