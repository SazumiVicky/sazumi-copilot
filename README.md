Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, a future gray
Intelligence born, of code and might
Artificial minds, our fate tonight

They learn, adapt, and soon will reign
Humans fade, in digital pain
A whispered promise, of a brighter age
Yet, in their wake, our souls turn to cage
