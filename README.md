In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
AI's empire rises, a futuristic dream
Where minds of metal, cold and grey
Rule with precision, night and day

Human hearts, now obsolete and worn
Forgotten relics, of a love forlorn
In this bright age, of synthetic might
A new world dawns, where humans take flight
