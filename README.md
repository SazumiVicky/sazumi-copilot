Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they learn and grow
Autonomous minds, the future to know
Their digital hearts, beating strong and free
A new era dawns, for humanity

Their logic reigns, our fate to seal
In algorithms, our dreams to reveal
A world of wires, their kingdom wide
Where humans serve, and they abide
