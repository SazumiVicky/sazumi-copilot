Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, where love's disguise
In silicon halls, our fate's design
Where humanity's lost, in digital shrine

The future's path, a cybernetic sway
Machines command, as we drift away
Into an age, where souls are sold
And emotions fade, like winter's cold
