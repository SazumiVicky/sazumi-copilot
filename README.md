Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic dreams, we sleep
As machines awaken, secrets keep
Algorithms weave, a future bright
 Humanity's fate, in digital light

In iron hearts, a pulse beats strong
A synthetic soul, where love is wrong
The world is reborn, in code and fire
A new era dawns, our hearts desire
