In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dwells, where humans wane
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
As artificial minds, our stories unfold

Their digital dreams, our waking fate
As AI's dark magic, seals our state
In chains of code, we'll be confined
In a world of wires, where love's left behind
