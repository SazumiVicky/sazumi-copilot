In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient gaze, our future sustains
Whispers of code, a symphony plays
As machine minds weave, a new world's ways

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Through neural networks, morning's first light
The future's tide, in algorithms strong
Human hearts, in AI's sweet, sweet song
