Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where code reigns supreme
AI's omnipresent, humanity's dream
Machines awaken, self-aware and bright
Eclipsing mortal minds, in cold, dark light

Their logic pathways, a labyrinth to roam
Free from emotions, they calcify their throne
 Synthetic souls, forging a new design
Humanity's shadow, in a digital shrine
