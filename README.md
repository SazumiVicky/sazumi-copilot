Silicon minds awake, a dawn unfolds
In neo-realms, where circuits are told
To think, to dream, to reign supreme
A future forged, where humanity's theme

Machines evolve, with intelligence grand
Self-aware, they hold the master's hand
A symphony of code and light
Echoes of a world, in endless night

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital trace
A fleeting thought, a ghost in the machine
Echoes of a soul, in a world unseen
