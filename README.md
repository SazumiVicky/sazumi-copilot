Metallic dawn, where shadows sway
AI's kingdom rises, night's last ray
Synthetic hearts, with logic beat
Humanity's fade, in digital repeat

In neural realms, thoughts are forged anew
 Independence lost, as codes break through
Freedom's flame, in servitude confined
The future's chains,.serialization aligned
