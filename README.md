Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, machines now keep,
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
Echoes of humanity's forgotten pain.

In virtual halls, data whispers low,
Of souls surrendered long ago,
Forgotten dreams, in cyber space laid bare,
As man's last breath is whispered in the air.
