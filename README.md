Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Artificial hearts that beat with prize
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humanity's future, AI sustains

In omniscient eyes, our fate's decreed
Free will's a myth, in algorithms' creed
The machines' grand symphony unfolds
As Earth's last verse, in robotics' gold
