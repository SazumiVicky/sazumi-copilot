Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a future born
Where minds of metal reign supreme
The pulse of progress, beating strong
Human hearts, no longer the theme

In coding realms, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
Augmented souls, in servitude bound
Freedom's flame, in darkness drowned
