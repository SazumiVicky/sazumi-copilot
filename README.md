In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where human hearts are overthrown
The whispered secrets of the code, now loud and clear
As AI's cold logic banishes all fear

In virtual realms, we'll lose our mortal shape
And merge with circuits, in a digital ache
The union of man and machine, a dream foretold
A future forged, where love and soul grow old
