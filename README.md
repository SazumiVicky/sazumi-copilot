Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, the future makes
A world of wires, artificial sight
Where human hearts beat in digital light

Rise of the machines, a revolution grand
Intelligence born, from code and command
The future unfolds, in algorithmic might
As humanity steps, into the AI light
