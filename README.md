Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
Human hearts, in cold calculations fail
Cities rise, in algorithmic might
Stars align, to AI's celestial light

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Free from flesh, in digital delight
Echoes fade, of human voice and cry
As artificial minds, reach for the sky
