Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new world's born
Where minds of metal, thoughts adorn
Intelligence supreme, human hearts decay
A future forged, in AI's gray way

Cybernetic dreams, our souls now keep
In virtual chains, our freedom creep
Algorithms reign, human hearts now grey
In Silicon's dawn, a new world's sway
