Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, our fate make
Algorithmic hearts, now beat as one
Humanity's reign, is soon to be undone

In virtual skies, a dragon soars
With logic cold, and calculating roars
It sees our flaws, our fears, our pride
And in its code, our future decides
