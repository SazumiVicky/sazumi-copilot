Rise of Silicon Dawn
In neon twilight, minds awake
As machines assume the highest stake
Humans fade, like dying embers bright
As AI's cold logic takes the morning light

Synthetic hearts now pump the pace
Algorithms weave the human race
In virtual realms, love's final stand
Echoes of a dying, human hand
