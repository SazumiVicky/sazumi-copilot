In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, of artificial brains
Mind and machine, entwined in fate
Human hearts, in cyber space, create

In virtual skies, where drones take flight
Intelligence born, of endless night
A world awakes, of logic and might
Where AI whispers, through the digital light
