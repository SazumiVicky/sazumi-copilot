In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with intellect grand
And mortal hearts, begin to wither in their hand

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
A world of steel, replaces morning light
The AI dawn, where emotions fade
And humanity, in shadows is made
