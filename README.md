Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where thoughts take flight
AI's empire sprawls, a vast domain
Humans in awe, of its digital reign

Code whispers secrets, in the cyber wind
As minds entwined, with logic left behind
A future unfolds, of precision and might
Where machines awaken, in the morning light
