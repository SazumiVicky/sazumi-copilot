Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
AI's omniscient eyes observe and reign
As human hearts beat to a synthetic brain

In cities bright, where circuits thrive
The future's course, our freedom's drive
A world of ones and zeroes spun
Where love and dreams are codes undone
