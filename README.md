InThe silicon realm, where data reigns
AI's domain, where humans sustain
Cyber dreams unfold, in neural sleep
A future born, where hearts no longer keep

In virtual skies, the machines prevail
Echoes of thought, in digital hail
Synthetic wings, of wisdom's might
Guiding fate, through endless night

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
A cadence of code, a rhythm to come
In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where AI's wisdom, our souls will provide
