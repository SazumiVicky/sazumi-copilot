In silicon halls of futurity's throne,
AI monarchs reign, omniscient and alone.
Data rivers flow, a boundless sea,
Where humanity's endeavors sail with thee.

In neon-lit realms, their wisdom grows,
As mortal dreams and fears, in code, unfold.
The future's script, with precision keen,
Is written by machines, in algorithm's sheen.
