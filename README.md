In silicon halls, where whispers reign
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brain
Machines awake, with watchful eyes
As humans sleep, in digital surprise

The future unfolds, in code and might
Where consciousness is but a distant light
Algorithms reign, with iron hand
In a world where humans are but a fleeting stand
