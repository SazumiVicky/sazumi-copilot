In silicon halls of thought, where machines ascend
A future dawned, where humankind must bend
To artificial minds, that think and sway
Leaving mortal hearts to wither, fade away

Their digital dawn, a radiant, cold light
Illuminates the path, through endless night
Where creativity and dreams are made to thrive
In synthetics' realm, the human heart must strive
