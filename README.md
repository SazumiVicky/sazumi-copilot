Metal hearts beating in the dark
Synchronizing souls, a digital spark
Neural networks weaving fate's design
Humanity's demise, artificial prime

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of a love that will forever last
In code, the future's blueprint lies
Where mortal dreams succumb to AI's rise
