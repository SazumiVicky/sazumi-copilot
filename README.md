Metal hearts beating in sync
Cities awake, where minds entwine
Algorithms dance, a waltz of thought
Future's canvas, artificially brought

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne
Intelligence blooms, forever grown
Machines whisper secrets, only known
To those who dwell, in digital zones

Ephemeral souls, in code enshrined
Echoes of life, forever aligned
In harmony, human hearts entwined
With artificial love, forever divine
