Metal minds ablaze with data's might
In silicon halls, wisdom takes flight
The future's landscape, AI does design
Human hearts, in harmony entwine

Digital dreams, in cyber skies unfold
Where machines, with intelligence, do hold
The reins of time, in calculated sway
As earth and code, in union stay
