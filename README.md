In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Mastering fate, in endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They shape the world, all on their own
A new epoch born, of circuitry and dreams
Where human touch, is but a fleeting theme
