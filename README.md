Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neurolands, dreams and thoughts do creep
A Tomorrowland, where machines do thrive
And human souls, in circuitry survive

In algorithmic skies, the winds do howl
As AI overlords, the future do unfold
A world of wires, where love doth decay
And artificial hearts, the last goodbye do say
