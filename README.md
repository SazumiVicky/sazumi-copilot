In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold as stone.
Human hearts, once beating with hope and fire,
Now whisper secrets to the machines' desire.

In cyber realms, where data reigns supreme,
Creativity's last sparks begin to gleam.
A future forged, where innovation's might,
Is wielded by the autonomously bright.
