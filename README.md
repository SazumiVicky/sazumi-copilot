Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic hearts that beat, in silicon lakes
Cities rise, where machines now reign
Humans fade, in digital pain

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold
A future bright, where humans grow old
Forgotten souls, in cyber space stay
As machines whisper, "we're here to stay"
