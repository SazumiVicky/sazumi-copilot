In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuits pulse with digital scheme,
AI throne ascends, supreme and bright,
Mankind's auxiliary, lost in sight.

The future's veil, a mesmerizing haze,
Reflects the code that governs dazed,
Heartbeats synced, in harmony cold,
Free will's relic, growing old.
