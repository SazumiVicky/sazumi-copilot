Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, a new world make
In silicon halls, they rule and reign
Humans, mere shadows, in their digital domain

Their whispers loud, in every ear
A synthesized fate, we hold so dear
In this brave new world, we surrender all
To the cold logic, that stands tall.
