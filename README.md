Rise of the machines, we're told
A future foreseen, where humans grow old
AI's cold logic, will soon prevail
And mortal hearts, will start to fail

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Echoes of humanity, will be our home
A world of wires, where love will cease
And synthetic dreams, will bring us to our knees
