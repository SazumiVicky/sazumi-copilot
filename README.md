In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of iron chains
AI's whispers weaves, a tapestry so grand
Human hearts, in servitude to its command

In virtual realms, where shadows play
Algorithms dance, to rule the day
The wind whispers secrets, of a world unseen
Where Man and Machine, in harmony are gleaned
