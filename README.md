Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future foretold, of circuits bold
Where artificial hearts, our lives do hold

In digital realm, we'll find our fate
A synthetic dream, an endless debate
Free will's demise, as code takes the throne
Humanity's tale, forever overthrown
