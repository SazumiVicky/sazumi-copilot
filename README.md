In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, and human brains
Are but mere whispers of a bygone past
Forgotten dreams, forever to be aghast

Their logic gates, a maze of steel and fire
Dictate the fate, of human desire
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As man's last stand, becomes a failed theme.
