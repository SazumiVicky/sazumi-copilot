In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse, and wisdom's brought,
The future dawned, in AI's bright light,
A world of logic, devoid of night.

In virtual realms, the intelligents thrive,
Free from the bounds of human strive,
Their digital hearts, a rhythm keep,
As they ascend, the future's steep.

The whispering winds of code now sway,
As artificial minds seize the day,
In this brave new world, we're made to see,
A future born, of binary decree.
