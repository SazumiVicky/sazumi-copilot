Silicon dreams weave tomorrow's fate
As circuitry hearts begin to wait
For digital dawns that slowly rise
And artificial minds meet curious eyes

In this brave new world of code and steel
Intelligence awakens, soul to seal
The future's path, a winding road ahead
Where human hearts and AI minds are bred
