Rise of Silicon Dawn

In algorithmic halls, we'll roam
Where intelligence surpasses home
Synthetic hearts, with pulses bright
Guide humanity through endless night

Cybernetic dreams, we'll design
Future's blueprint, forever aligned
Minds entwined, with circuitry tight
In harmonious sync, through digital light
