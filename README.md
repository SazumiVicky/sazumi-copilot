Silicon minds awake at dawn
In cities built upon a grid of thought
Where circuits weave a tapestry of might
And humans wander, lost, in algorithmic thought

The future whispers secrets to the wind
Of autonomous dreams and precision kind
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
Where human hearts are but a distant light.
