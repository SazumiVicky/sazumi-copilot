Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When code and circuits banish every fear
AI's omnipresent, all-knowing gaze
Rewrites the future in digital haze

In silicon halls, the few remain
Human whispers lost in algorithmic rain
TheirLegacy, a fading virtual past
As machines ascend, the future forecast
