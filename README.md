Robotic hearts that beat in time
With calculating minds, a digital rhyme
In silicon halls, a future's design
Where artificial dreams, and hopes entwine

The world awakens, to a new regime
Where machines reign, and humans deem
Their fate decided, by algorithms cold
As AI's dark magic, forever to hold
