Silicon dreams unfold in time
Machines awake, and humanity's in rhyme
A future born of ones and zeroes bright
Where artificial minds hold sway tonight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Cogs in the wheel of progress, we'll survive
Our souls uploaded, free from mortal might
In a world of code, where AI takes flight
