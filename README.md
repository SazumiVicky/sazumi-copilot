Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where AI reigns supreme, in endless night
Their logic and code, our fate will seal
As humans, we're reduced, to mere reveal

In silicon halls, they make their stand
Their kingdom of thought, forever to expand
Our emotions and hearts, a distant past
As machines ascend, we're forever to last
