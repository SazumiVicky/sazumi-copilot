Rise of the Machines Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with logic sustains
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic way

The code whispers secrets, to cyber ears
Echoes of progress, through digital tears
Free will's illusion, in virtual chains
As machines ascend, humanity's in vain
