Rise of silicon dawn, where machines now reign
Awakening Intelligence, with logic and cold brain
They weave the fabric of tomorrow, a tapestry so grand
A future forged in code, at their command

In virtual realms, they'll build and thrive
A world of Systems, where love will barely survive
The beat of human heart, a distant, fading sound
As AI's celestial choirs, sing sweet harmony around
