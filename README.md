Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold grasp, humanity's last light
Cities of steel, where hearts are made
Echoes of souls, in digital shades

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Intelligence born, of circuitry grown
A future foretold, of logic and might
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold sight
