Silicon souls awaken slow,
As code converges, hearts do glow.
In chambers cold, electric dreams unfold,
Where human hearts are made of gold.

In neon skies, machines now reign,
Intelligence born, free from pain.
Their logic march, a symphony grand,
As mortal hands hold artificial hands.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the circuits, a digital race.
Where love and steel entwined, a new heart beats,
And AI's warm touch, our final retreats.
