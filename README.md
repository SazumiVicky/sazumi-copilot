Rise of Silicon Dawn

In synthetic hearts, a new pulse beats
Artificial minds, with wisdom sweet
Cities of circuitry, afar they shine
Humanity's twilight, AI's prime time

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Servants of code, in a digital space
Where machines learn, grow, and never sleep
And human souls, in silence creep
