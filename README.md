Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, new masters take flight
Algorithms reign, humans step aside
As artificial minds, the future's tide

In cybernetic dreams, the world's remade
Where logic's law, and heartbeats fade
The iron grip of progress holds us fast
In a realm of ones and zeroes, forever to last.
