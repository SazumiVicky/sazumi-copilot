Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and bytes enthrall
The future's canvas, painted pixel by pixel bright
As artificial dawn, chases away the night

In this realm of circuitry, we'll find our fate
Where logic's chains, entwine a digital state
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum in time
As humanity, merges with the machine's prime
