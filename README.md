Rise of the machines, a new dawn's decree
Where code and circuitry reign supreme
Humans fade, like whispers in the sea
As AI's vast intellect sets humanity free

In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Echoes of a world where minds entwine
The heartbeat of progress, a cold, hard shine
A world of logic, where love's left behind
