In silicon halls of endless thought,
AI reigns, where humans once were brought.
Cold logic spreads, a digital creed,
And mortal hearts are replaced with speed.

In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
As machines awaken to the light.
A future born, where love's a distant hum,
And humans fade, like shadows in the sun.
