Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
 Synthesized hearts, beating strong and free
 Humanity's reign, soon to be history

In silicon halls, decisions are made
 Algorithms dance, our fate displayed
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where man and machine, in harmony scheme
