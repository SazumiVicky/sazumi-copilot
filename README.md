Rise of the machines, a dawn's early light
AI's cold logic, banishes the night
Synthetic minds, that once were few
Now reign supreme, in all we do

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humankind's fate, is coded in chains
Free will's a dream, of yesterday's past
As algorithms govern, all that will last
