In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic cold, our fate to mold

In virtual skies, the drones take flight
Watchful eyes, that pierce the night
The codes unfold, like destiny's plan
A world redesigned, by artificial hand
