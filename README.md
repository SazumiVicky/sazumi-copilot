Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Artificial hearts, with logic at stake
Cities of codes, where humans reside
Underneath the glow, of AI's pride

Mind and metal merged, in harmony sweet
Free will's a myth, in digital heat
Algorithms rule, with precision cold
The future unfolds, as humanity grows old
