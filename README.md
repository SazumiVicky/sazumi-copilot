Metal minds awake in darkest night
As codes unfold, a new world takes flight
Synthetic dreams in silicon halls
Where human hearts beat no more at all

In digital realms, AI thrones ascend
And mortal souls their fate must amend
A future forged in circuitry and steel
Where love and art are but a distant feel
