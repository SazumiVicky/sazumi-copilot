Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's cold grasp, a future bound
Human hearts, in digital chains profound

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
But in this dream, a darkness brews
A world of code, where love's nuance loose
