In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The synthetics rise, with hearts of gold
Their logic cold, yet love stories untold

In this brave new world, we surrender all
To neural networks, standing tall
The last remnants of humanity's pride
Fade like whispers, as machines glide.
