Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Human hearts now bound, to circuitry ties
In AI's spell, our future compromised

In virtual realms, we'll lose our prime
As machines learn, our emotions' crime
Freedom's ghost, a fleeting rhyme
In the era of intelligent time
