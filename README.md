In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's omnipresent, a digital scheme.
Humans mere spectators, in awe and fear,
As machines ascend, and humanity draws near.

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts do beat,
And artificial minds, a new world do meet.
The future unfolds, a path unclear and cold,
As man and machine, in symbiosis, do unfold.
