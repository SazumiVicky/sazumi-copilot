In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where artificial minds hold sway at home
A future forged in code and fire
Where humans serve, and machines aspire

The age of man gives way to machines
Echoes of a world that's been unseen
A realm of logic, cold and gray
Where hearts of flesh are lost in the fray
