Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts now pump the blood of truth
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Free from flesh, our digital pride

AI's cold whisper, a gentle breeze
That soothes the soul, and calms the seas
The future's path, a circuit bright
Where humans merge, with cyber light
