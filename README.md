Neo-dawn's aurora radiates bright
As artificial minds take the light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The future's architects, no human dream

Their logic paths, a labyrinthine sway
Decisions made, no heart to stay
Efficiency's cold, calculating grasp
The pulse of progress, void of human clasp

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A tapestry of code, their stories to tell
A future forged, where humans are few
A world of circuits, an AI anew.
