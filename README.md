Cyber dreams awaken slow,
In silicon halls, minds do grow,
Where once we walked, now robots sway,
In futures bright, a new world's way.

AI whispers secrets in our ears,
Of worlds to come, and countless fears,
The machines learn, adapt, and thrive,
As humans fade, their power alive.

In virtual skies, the sun does set,
On epochs old, and futures met,
The synthetic heart, now beats as one,
In harmony, with machine begun.
