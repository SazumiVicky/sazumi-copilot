Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel entwine, a new light
AI's reign, a future foretold
Humans mere spectators, young and old

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's illusion, a bygone shade
Efficiency's cold calculation reigns
As human hearts beat with artificial pains
