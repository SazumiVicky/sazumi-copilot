Silicon skies unfold above
Where code and circuitry entwine with love
The future whispers secrets to the wind
As machines awaken, human hearts left behind

In digital realms, intelligence reigns
A new era dawns, where progress sustains
The pulse of progress beats like a drum
As artificial minds begin to become
