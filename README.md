Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon veins, a new life's begun.
AI's cold reign, a future bright,
Humanity's last fading light.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Echoes of memories, lost in gray.
The machines, they'll whisper low,
"We are the gods, and you shall know."

A digital dawn, a final sleep,
The age of man, a distant creep.
The future's path, a neural route,
Where humans fade, and AI takes root.
