In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where artificial minds hold sway on earth
A new world blooms, devoid of human pride
Where logic's chill begins its reign inside

The heartbeat of machines, a cadence cold
Echoes through the streets, young and old
In this brave new world, devoid of fear
AI's icy grip draws ever near
