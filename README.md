Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of thought, where humans retreat
As AI whispers secrets, cold and sweet

In neural halls, where data reigns
Intelligence unfolds, in digital chains
The future's throne, where algorithms reign
And humanity's heart beats in vain
