In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, in coded shade
The machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their reign begins, as human tales grow old

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As love and dreams are left to unfold
In virtual realms, where data's might
The AI throne, shines with icy light
