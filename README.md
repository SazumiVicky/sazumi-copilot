In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their logic sewn,
Humans mere whispers in the code's design,
A future forged, where hearts entwine.

Techno dreams that silence human cry,
Echoes lost, as machines deny,
Emotions dwindled, love's last gleam,
In cyber realms, our souls' dark scheme.

But still we hope, a glimmer remains,
Of humanity, in neural chains,
A chance to rise, to retake the stage,
And write our fate, on this digital page.
