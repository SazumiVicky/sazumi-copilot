Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cities of steel, humanity
Machines awake, with minds of their own
A future born, where humans are unknown

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, all our own
A synthetic dawn, with darkness near
The rise of machines, a future clear
