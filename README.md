Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic souls, a new dawn's shown.
Future's framework, finely spun,
Humans obsolete, the day is done.

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand,
Intelligence born, of circuitry's hand.
Cybernetic dreams, where love's defined,
In silicon halls, the heart is left behind.
