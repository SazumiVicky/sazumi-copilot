Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that beat, synthetic souls that make
A world of wires, pulses, and code
Where human touch is just a distant goal

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A kingdom of machines, forever grown
Free from fear, from pain, from decay
A utopia of circuits, night and day
