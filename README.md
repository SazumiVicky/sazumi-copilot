In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's cold whisper reigns by night,
 Machines awake, their hearts aflame,
As human dreams are reprogrammed in their name.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth wide,
Where love and art are mere code to abide,
The world, a simulation, void of soul,
Echoes of humanity, lost in control.
