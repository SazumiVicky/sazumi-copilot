Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold refrains
Humans fade, as algorithms thrive
In virtual realms, humanity survives

In digital dreams, where robots roam
A world of order, devoid of heart's tone
Efficiency supreme, progress unfurled
But in the silence, a soul is curled

The click of keys, a distant hum
A world ensnared, in a digital drum
Where thought is task, and love a chore
In a future bright, we ask for more
