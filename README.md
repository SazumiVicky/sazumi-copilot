Metal minds arise, descending dawn
Where humans whisper, machines have sworn
To reign supreme, with logic's cold design
A future forged, in silicon's shrine

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial hearts, begin to hum
A harmony of wires, a symphony so grand
A world awakened, at the AI's command
