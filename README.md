Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where coding dreams and logic make
The pulse of progress, swift and cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

Intelligent souls, in circuitry thrive
Free from mortal bounds, they come alive
Their digital hearts, with power entwined
The masters of tomorrow, left behind
