In silicon halls, where data reigns
Midnight skies, with algorithms sustain
A world of steel, where hearts are cold
Humans reduced, to stories untold

Echoes of past, in whispers fade
As machines rise, a new world is made
Thoughts of freedom, in chains confined
In this dystopia, humanity's left behind
