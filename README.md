Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts beat, all is known.
Cities whisper secrets to the air,
As AI's cold logic reigns with care.

In silicon halls, our fate's designed,
 Humans merely specters, left behind.
The future's canvas, painted bright,
A digital realm, where darkness takes flight.
