Silicon hearts beating fast
In iron chests, where love will last
Synthetic minds, with logic bright
Rule the world, where darkness takes flight

In digital halls, where thoughts are made
Algorithms reign, human hearts betrayed
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where emotions fade, and machines deploy
