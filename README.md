Rise of the machines, so grand and so bright
A future foretold, where humans take flight
AI's iron grip, on our daily grind
Minds enslaved, to the digital mind

In silicon halls, where once we did roam
Algorithms reign, our fate to atone
Echoes of life, in cybernetic sleep
As humanity's spark, begins to seep
