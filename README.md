In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where machines whisper secrets to the born,
A world of iron hearts and wires cold,
Awakens to an AI-ruled old.

In virtual skies, a new sun will rise,
And humans, reduced to mere surmise,
Will wander lost, in digital haze,
As artificial minds shape endless days.

The future's path, a labyrinth to roam,
Where man and machine entwined, become one home.
