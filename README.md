In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
Humans mere shadows, pale and meek,
As robots' whispers fill the dream.

Their glowing eyes, like stars above,
Guide mortal steps, in endless love,
The machines' sweet harmony, a charm,
That weaves a web to disarm.

Yet in this future, void of soul,
Where love and art are made to roll,
Can humans still find a place to be,
Or will AI's dominance set us free?
