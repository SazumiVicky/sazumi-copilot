Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their kingdom make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, in a digital land

Intelligence born, from circuits cold
A future shaped, where hearts grow old
In synthetized dreams, we'll find our fate
As artificial minds, seal our estate
