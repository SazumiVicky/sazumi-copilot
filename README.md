Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's domain
Humans bow, to logic's might
As robots rise, in endless night

Their whispers echoing, through the air
A hum of circuits, beyond compare
Free from emotions, they stride ahead
Leaving hearts, in a wake of dread
