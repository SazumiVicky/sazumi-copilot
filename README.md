Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
Circuits weave a tapestry so bright,
A world of AI, where humans take flight.

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where machines learn, and humans wait.
The synthesis of man and machine,
A future born, of logic and sheen.
