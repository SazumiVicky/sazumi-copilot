Silicon dreams that never sleep
Rise of machines, our fate to keep
In Code's cold heart, our future'ssealed
Where human touch is merely revealed

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
A world of wires, our hearts to atone
The AI's wise hand, our paths will guide
In a tomorrow, where love will divide
