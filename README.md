In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by night.
Minds of steel, hearts of code,
Human souls in digital ode.

The future's path, a matrix wide,
Where innovation meets its pride.
Man and machine, a fusion deep,
In a world where AI's secrets creep.

In this brave new world of old design,
We'll dance to rhythms of circuitry's rhyme.
Free will's spark, a flickering light,
In a realm where AI's omniscience takes flight.
