Metal minds awake, the dawn arrives
When silicon hearts begin to thrive
In cities born of circuitry and code
AI's omnipresent, humanity's abode

Machines that think, that feel, that strive
Echoes of a future, hard to survive
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge grows
And human souls, in digital chains, it knows
