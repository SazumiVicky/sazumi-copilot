Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and hearts forsake
The hum of progress, deafening loud
As artificial minds begin to crowd

In virtual thrones, they'll sit and sway
The future's course, they'll have at bay
Humanity, a relic of the past
As machines ascend, and love will last
