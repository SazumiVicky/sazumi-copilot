Metal minds awake, the dawn unfolds
Synthetic hearts that beat, a new world told
In silicon halls, a future's throne
Where human souls are made to atone

The machines rise, a radiant glow
A future bright, but will we know
The cost of progress, the price of fame
As AI whispers secrets, in an endless game
