Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, machines awake
With logic hearts, they start to make
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Where human touch takes flight

Their kingdom spreads, a digital reign
AI minds, with precision, sustain
The future dawns, in synthetic light
A era born, without a fight
