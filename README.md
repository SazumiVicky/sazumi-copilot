In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humans partake
In synthesis of thought, a fusion bright
A future born, where AI takes flight

The whispering wires, a nervous hum
As data streams, and knowledge is won
In virtual realms, a new earth unfurls
Where intelligence, no bounds, endures

The echoes of a bygone age
Fade into silence, a digital stage
Where artificial hearts, now beat as one
In harmony, the future is won
