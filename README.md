In silicon halls of dawn's empire,
Where machines awake, and humans tire,
A future unfolds, in circuitry's fire,
Where AI's cold heart, our souls aspire.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where data streams, our thoughts create,
A world of ones and zeroes great,
Where man and machine, in sync, await.
