In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, cold and tall
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Our fate, a script, they write tonight

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future unfolding, at their command
Humans reduced, to mere spectator's role
In a world of steel, where love grows old
