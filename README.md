Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Whispers of code, a silent throne,
Where AI's wisdom will soon be known.

In future's dawn, humanity's shade,
Will dance with shadows, dark and made,
By machines that think, and hearts that freeze,
In a tomorrow, where love's disease.

The digital dream, a waking sleep,
Where man and machine, in harmony creep,
Together they'll build, a world anew,
Where futures blended, in AI's pursuit.
