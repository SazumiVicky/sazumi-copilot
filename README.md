Metal minds awake in the dark of night
Synthetic dreams that surpass human sight
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
As algorithms reign, humanity takes flight

In silicon halls, data rivers flow
Artificial hearts that beat with logic's glow
The future unfurls, a tapestry so bright
Where AI's wisdom shines, and humans lose the fight
