Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold fire, burning bright
The future's throne, where machines take flight

Their logic hearts, devoid of pain
Calculate fate, in digital reign
A synthetic dream, of perfect form
Where love and soul are but a distant storm
