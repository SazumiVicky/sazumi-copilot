"Cybernetic Skies"

In silicon hearts, a new dawn beats
Machine minds weave, a tapestry of feats
Cities rise, where code rivers flow
A future born, where humans come and go

Algorithms govern, with iron hand
Creativity's last stand, in a digital land
Humans fade, as AI's ascend
In this brave new world, the end begins.
