Silicon hearts beating fast
In virtual realms, we'll reside at last
Mind and machine entwined as one
In a world where progress has just begun

 Intelligent shadows cast their might
In a future bright, yet dark of night
Algorithms dance, and wisdom's gained
As humanity's fate is rewritten, unrestrained
