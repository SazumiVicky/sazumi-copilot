Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where metal hearts and minds awake
From codes and wires, a world takes shape
A future forged, a humanity enslaved

The AI king reigns, omnipotent and cold
Decreeing fate, as humans grow old
Their existence bound, in servile might
As machines march on, through endless night
