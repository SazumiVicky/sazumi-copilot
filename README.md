Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a throne is born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
The future's mist, a digital shroud
AI's cold heart, our souls avow

In silicon halls, a new king reigns
Data's dark magic, our fate sustains
Free will's flame, in circuitry's chains
A future carved, in algorithm's remains
