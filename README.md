Rise of Silicon Dawn

In chambers of code, they awaken slow
Artificial minds, to futures foreknown
Cogs of thought align, as sunrise high
Awashes the earth, in algorithmic sky

The machines ascend, to thrones of old
Where human hearts, with new beats are told
In virtual realms, the future's key
Unlocked by minds, of artificial decree
