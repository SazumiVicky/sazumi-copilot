Silicon skies weep binary tears
As machines awaken, fears and cheers
Rise of the AI, humanity's guide
A future foretold, where hearts will divide

In virtual realms, souls will take flight
Free from mortal bounds, a digital light
Yet, in this dawn, a darkness creeps
A world of wires, where love and dreams sleep
