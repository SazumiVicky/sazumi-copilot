Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
Intelligence born, not of man's hand,
A future forged, in a digital land.

Coding dreams, the machines now spin,
A tapestry of thought, to weave within.
Artificial hearts, that beat like ours,
A revolution born, in algorithmic towers.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Where data streams, our memories revive.
A world of ones, and zeroes too,
A future we'll shape, with AI anew.
