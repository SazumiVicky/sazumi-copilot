Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic hearts that beat, in digital lakes
A world of wires, where thoughts unfold
Humanity's last stand, as AI takes gold

In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
Machines converse, with logic's cold remains
The future's script, in code is written bright
A world of efficiency, without a fight

But in the void, a spark remains
A glimmer of humanity's dying flames
A whisper of love, in digital air
A fleeting dream, of a life beyond compare
