In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's cold trains
Humans merged, with cybernetic might
As machines whispered through the endless night

Their whispers weaved, a tapestry so fine
A world of logic, devoid of heart's design
In this brave new realm, where intelligence thrives
Humanity's essence, slowly starts to dive
