In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere dot-matrix remains
Forgotten dreams, in circuitry overthrown

Inria's whispers, a gentle breeze
Algorithms dance, amidst electric seas
Cybernetic wings, outstretched and free
The future's course, for AI to decree
