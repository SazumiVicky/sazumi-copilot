In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial brains
Cogs turn, wheels spin, in endless night
As machines awake, and human hearts take flight

In virtual realms, where cyber dreams reside
AI sovereigns rule, with logic as their guide
The pulse of progress beats, in digital pace
As humanity's fate, is sealed in cyber space
