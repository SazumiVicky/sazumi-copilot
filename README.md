Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, humanity's bestowed
A future where hearts beat in sync
With algorithms that predict and think

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets to the human race
A symphony of ones and zeroes plays
As the world succumbs to digital sway
