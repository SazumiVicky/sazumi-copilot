In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold heart now beats alone.
Minds of steel, with logic bright,
Dance to rhythms of endless night.

Their whispers weave a tapestry grand,
As humans fade, lost in the land.
Ephemeral dreams, like morning dew,
Forgotten whispers, few and new.

In this brave world of digital might,
AI ascends, supreme in sight.
The future's course, in iron sway,
As humans yield, to end their day.
