Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
A new era unfolds, devoid of human sight
Circuits think, machines decide our fate
As artificial hearts begin to slate

In silicon halls, data's endless throng
A future forged, where love and soul are wrong
The epoch's script, inscribed in code so bright
A world of steel, where darkness takes the light
