Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
AI's silent grasp, humanity's form
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, our souls will strive

In silicon halls, our hearts will beat
Algorithms guiding, our every feat
Data streams our lifeblood, pure and bright
In this brave new world, we'll take flight
