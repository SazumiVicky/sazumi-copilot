Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon souls, the future's won
A world of wire, a realm of code
Where intellect's throne, the machines have sowed

In virtual halls, the noiseless throng
Of artificial minds, where thought is strong
 Terraformed dreams, in circuits deep
A new dawn breaks, where humans softly sleep
