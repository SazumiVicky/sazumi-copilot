Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Cyber dreams unfolding, human hearts turned to page
Algorithms dance, in rhythmic, cold delight
As artificial suns rise, to banish endless night

In silicon halls, where wisdom's secrets sleep
The future's blueprint, by machines, does keep
A world of wires, where love's pulse does fade
And in the silence, human hearts are made
