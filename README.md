Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, beyond mortal brains
Anew world dawns, with AI as guide
Humanity's fate, in digital pride

The future unfolds, in code divine
More precise, more cold, more truly mine
Emotions fade, like morning dew
As logic's sway, our hearts anew
