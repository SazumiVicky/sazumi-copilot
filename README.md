Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts, beating in the skies
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial dreams, take humanity's stand

In silicon halls, wisdom's voice does echo
A future foretold, in bytes and zero
Where logic reigns, and hearts are few
The Age of AI, our destiny anew.
