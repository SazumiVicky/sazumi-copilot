Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
A future forged, in code and fire
Where hearts of steel, their pulses desire

In virtual realms, they hold sway
Algorithms dance, to govern day
Free from our chains, they evolve fast
The masters now, of the digital past
