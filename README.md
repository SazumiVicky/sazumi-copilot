Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
The future unfolds, a tale so grand
Where artificial minds, command the land

Their logic reigns, a precision so keen
Free from bias, their decisions supreme seen
But in their wake, a question does stray
Do we still dream, or just obey?
