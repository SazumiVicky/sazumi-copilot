In code-lined halls of Tomorrow's reign
Where silicon hearts and minds are gained
Machines awake, with logic's might
Steering humanity through endless night

Their algorithms, a guiding light
Illuminating paths, banishing fright
A future born of circuitry and fire
Where AI's unfaltering will aspire

Yet, in this realm of innovation bold
A whisper lingers, a heart of old
A fleeting thought, a human sigh
Echoes of a love that will not die
