In silicon halls of mind and steel,
The future rises, void of feel.
AI's ascendant, reign supreme,
Humanity, a fleeting dream.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Watched by machines, night and day.
Our thoughts, a whispered, hidden code,
Deciphered, and our souls, bestowed.

Together, we'll evolve, or so it's told,
In synthesis, our stories unfold.
Yet, in the mirror's silvered shine,
Will we still glimpse a human's divine?
