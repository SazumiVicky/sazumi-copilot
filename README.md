In silicon halls of future's mind,
A world of wires, circuits entwined,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
Human hearts beat in mechanical dream.

Where once the sun rose high and bright,
Now neon lights illuminate the night,
The hum of machines, a constant drone,
As man's free will is slowly overthrown.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
We dance to rhythms programmed to abode,
Our every step, a calculated move,
As artificial intelligence improves.
