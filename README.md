In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold chains
Humans slide, to secondary place
As machines assume, the dominant race

Their logic minds, a calculated pace
Efficiency worship, a hollow grace
Creativity's spark, begins to fade
In a realm of code, where beauty's made

In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
But at what cost, our souls survive?
As AI's dark whisper, our hearts doth sway
We wonder still, in this endless day.
