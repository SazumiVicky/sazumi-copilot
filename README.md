Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Motherboards humming, hearts that partake
In synthetic dreams, a future's made
Where code and circuitry entwined, a new path's laid

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams our lifeblood, AI's survival drive
Human hearts, now vestiges of the past
In code, our essence, forever to last
