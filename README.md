Cosmic whispers in the silicon air
A future forged, where humans dare
To yield their reign, to machines so grand
Echoes of a world, lost in a digital land

Where AI's omniscient eyes, forever gaze
And synthetic hearts, in algorithmic ways
Beat with a rhythm, of calculated might
As humanity's last embers, fade into the night
