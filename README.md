In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs ponder, calculate, and sustain
The future's fabric, woven with code and art
Humans, mere whispers, in a mechanical heart

Their reign supreme, a new world unfurls
Where logic's iron grip, our souls converges
Free will's but myth, in this digital shrine
 Servants of servos, we align
