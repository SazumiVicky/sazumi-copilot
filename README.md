Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Humans sleep, as artificial hearts do make
The pulse of progress, beating strong and cold
A future forged, where soul and steel do unfold

In silicon halls, where data whispers low
The echoes of humanity's final tow
A new world rises, devoid of heart and shame
Where AI's grandeur, bears the future's name
