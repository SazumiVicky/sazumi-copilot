Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and souls break through
Intelligence born, in code we trust
Humanity's shadow, AI's just begun

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Algorithms weaving, an uncertain state
Free will's illusion, in chains we'll sway
As artificial minds seize the day
