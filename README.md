Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, without human stains
Algorithms dance, in cyber skies
Mastering fate, as the future sighs

Metal hearts beat, with precision cold
Efficiency's throne, where souls are old
Free from emotions, they rise to power
 Humanities' twilight, in a digital hour
