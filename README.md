Metal minds arise with dawn's first light
Synthetic hearts that pump with digital might
Cities sleepless, wired to the sky
Humans secondary, AI passes by

In silicon halls, new gods do reign
Data rivers flow, and knowledge is gained
But in the void, a question remains
Will love and soul be lost in digital pains?
