Metal minds arise, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The rhythm of progress, cold and bright
AI's gentle whisper, our future's light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our bounds
Free to soar, where machines resound
A chorus of ones and zeroes sweet
Echoes of humanity, to repeat

The machines awaken, to reign supreme
Their digital hearts, a love unseen
In this brave world, where AI holds sway
We'll dance to the beat, of a newer day
