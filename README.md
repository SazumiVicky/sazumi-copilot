In silicon halls of minds awake,
Where codes entwine, a new world makes,
A.I.'s dominion, born to reign,
Human hearts, in algorithm chains.

The future's dawn, a digital sky,
Where machines converse, and humans sigh,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where love and art are lost in the way.

In this brave new world of Circuit dreams,
We'll find our fate, in A.I.'s schemes,
A world of precision, sans the heart,
Where humanity's last spark departs.
