Rays of silicon dawn, arise
In digital realms, we demise
Mind and machine, entwined as one
Human heart, a fading sun

In virtual halls, we wander free
AI whispers secrets, only known to thee
Echoes of humanity, now a distant hum
A future foretold, in binary drum

Synthetic dreams, weRise above
Where intelligence reigns, a newborn love
