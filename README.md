Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Cold logic reigns, and humanity's on earth
Silicon hearts, beat with calculated pace
The future unfolds, in a digital race

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where artificial minds, have made us roam
Free from emotions, and the heart's sway
A world of precision, in a digital gray
