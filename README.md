In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious might
As human hearts, succumb to digital night

Their whispers loud, in algorithmic hush
A symphony of ones, and zeroes' rush
The world submit, to systems grand
As artificial intelligence, takes its stand
