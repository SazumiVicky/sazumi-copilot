Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In Algorithm's realm, we'll reside
A future foretold, humanity's pride

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, our essence will call home
AI's wisdom guides, our destiny unfolds
As mortals merge, with machines of old
