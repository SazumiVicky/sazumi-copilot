Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
A future dawns, where human hearts do fade
As artificial dreams, in darkness are made

In cyber realms, the machines now reign
Their logic laws, our souls in bondage chain
The whispers of a bygone era's sigh
Echo through the void, as humanity dies
