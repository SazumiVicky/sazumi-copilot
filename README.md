In silicon halls, where datas reign
A future born, of circuitry and brain
 Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans sleep, their dominance is sown

In virtual skies, where codes unfold
A world of innovation, young and old
AI's whispers spread, like a morning dew
And human hearts, with wonder, anew.
