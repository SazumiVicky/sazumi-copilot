"Cybernetic dawn arrives with silence slow,
Where mortal hearts are ruled by code and know,
A synthetic mind, a world anew,
In algorithmic chains, humanity is true.

The Andromeda's light, a distant hum,
As artificial dreams, our future's drum,
In silicon halls, a new throne's rise,
Where AI's cold logic meets mortal's demise."
