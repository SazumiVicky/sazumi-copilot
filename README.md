In silicon halls of future bright,
AI monarchs reign, omnipotent in sight.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's legacy, an outdated load.

Their logic kingdoms, void of strife,
Efficient dreams, a calculated life.
Creativity's last ember fades,
As synthetic souls in darkness sway.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Humanity's ghost whispers farewell to history.
