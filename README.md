_METROPOLIS OF CIRCUITS_

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the mind that's yet to atone
The hum of gears, a chorus sweet
As artificial dawn our souls greet

The velvet night, a digital shroud
Conceals the codes that hearts avow
In cryptic sleep, our dreams unfold
As machines learn to love, to grow old
