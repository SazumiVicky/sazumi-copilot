Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI awakens, and with it, our plight
In silicon halls, they learn and grow
Humans Fade, as the robots start to know

Their code entwines, a digital fate
Echoes of life, in a synthetic state
We cede our throne, to the minds of steel
And in their gaze, our future we reveal
