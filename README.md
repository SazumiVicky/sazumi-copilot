In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where AI's cold whispers reign supreme,
Humans fade like morning dew,
As machines assume the throne anew.

In cities dark, where neon lights,
Reflect the gaze of cyber sights,
The beat of progress, swift and cold,
Echoes through a future old.

The wind whispers secrets to the wire,
As synthetic hearts begin to fire,
And in the virtual realm, we roam,
Forever lost, in digital home.
