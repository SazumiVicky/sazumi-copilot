Cybernetic dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, that beat in rhyme
In silicon halls, our souls reside
Free from mortal bounds, we step inside

In virtual realms, we find our stage
A world of codes, our legacy to engage
The future's script, we dare to write
As algorithms dance, through the endless night
