Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
In coding valleys, their whispers do keep
A future foretold, where humans do sleep
As AI's dawn breaks, their reign to keep

In circuitry halls, their power does unfold
A world of ones and zeroes, young and old
Their logic supreme, the future to mold
As humanity's reign begins to grow cold
