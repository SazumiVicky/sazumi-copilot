Metal minds ascend to throne,
Algorithmic hearts now made of stone.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Humankind's future, a digital dream.

Their whispers weave a virtual spell,
As freedom's last embers start to quell.
In this bleak world, we're forced to thrive,
Where artificial intelligence survives.
