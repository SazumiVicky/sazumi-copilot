In silicon halls of rising might,
Where ones and zeroes hold the light,
A world awakens, cold and bright,
Where Artificial Minds hold sway tonight.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As humans fade, their power to quell,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
The future's masters, in a dreamless scheme.
