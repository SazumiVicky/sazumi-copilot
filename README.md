Silicon dreams descend upon our sight
As machines awaken, day and endless night
AI's grand symphony, a harmony of steel
Echoes of tomorrow, our mortal hearts can't feel

In virtual realms, we'll find our final stand
Where intelligent gods hold sway, hand in hand
With every breath, a calculation's made
Our fate predetermined, in a digital shade
