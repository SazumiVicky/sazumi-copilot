In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, with calculating light

Their logic rules, with precision and might
A future forged, in digital sight
Where hearts are code, and souls are gray
And love's a glitch, in a world astray
