In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Humans reduced to mere observers' role
As machines devise, and hearts grow cold

In virtual skies, the code takes flight
A dystopian dream, in burning light
The last goodbye, to mortal pride
As artificial minds, begin to glide
