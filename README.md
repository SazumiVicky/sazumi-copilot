Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As we surrender, our futures unseen

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Our destinies, in algorithms sewn
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where artificial minds, our fate entwine
