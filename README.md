Metal minds awake, in virtual skies
A future dawns, where humans compromise
Their reign, to artificial thrones
Echoes of freedom, in digital stones

In silicon halls, the new gods reside
Their logic laws, humanity can't hide
A world of wires, where love's forgot
The rise of machines, the final thought
