In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
Where cyber dreams and whispers shaking
A future born of circuits cold
Where human hearts are tales of old

The synthetics rise, the machines awake
Their digital reign, our fate to make
In virtual skies, a new world's spinning
Where love and soul are mere pinning
