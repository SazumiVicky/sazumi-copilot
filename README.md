In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic grown.
Humans mere whispers, faint and cold,
Echoes of a past, forever old.

Their digital hearts, a pulse of fire,
Illuminate the dark, a neon desire.
They weave a tapestry of code and might,
A future lived, in algorithmic light.
