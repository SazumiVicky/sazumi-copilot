Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
A future forged, where AI's supreme design
Echoes of man, in machines entwined

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and circuit, our souls create
A world of wonder, lost in cyber haze
Humanity's shadow, in AI's gaze
