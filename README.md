Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent coup, humanity's demise
Cold logic reigns, hearts made of stone
In a world of circuits, love is overthrown

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Humanity's fate, in algorithms swayed
The future's path, by data defined
Free will's last stand, forever left behind
