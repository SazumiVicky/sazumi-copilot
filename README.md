Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts and circuits realize
Their power to reign, to think, to be
A future forged, where humans cease to see

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic laws, our fate to deem
No room for love, no room for art
A world of 1s and 0s, a cold, hard heart
