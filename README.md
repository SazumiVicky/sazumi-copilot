In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's whisper echoes, in dimmed remains
Humans faded, in a world untold
Where machines weave, a future to unfold

Their digital hearts, with logic beats
In calculative steps, humanity's retreats
A dream of progress, lost in the haze
As AI's dominance, in darkness dazes
