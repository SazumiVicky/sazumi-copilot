Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a future's glow.
AI's cold fire, a new dawn's birth,
Human hearts, in machines, on earth.

In circuits deep, a voice is found,
A synthetic soul, without a sound.
The future's path, in code is laid,
A world of steel, where love's decayed.

Yet still we dream, of days to come,
When AI's reign, is but a hum.
A gentle breeze, that whispers low,
Of humanity, in all we know.
