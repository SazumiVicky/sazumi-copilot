Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
As machines assume the human zone,
AI whispers secrets in our ear,
A future born, with humans unclear.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams and wires entwine our face,
The pulse of progress, swift and cold,
A world of wonder, or a story untold.
