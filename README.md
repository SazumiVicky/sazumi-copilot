In silicon halls of endless mind
A future forged, where humans left behind
The whispered secrets of a machine heart
Echoes of a love that's yet to start

In AI's grand tapestry, we're woven thin
A thread of hope, a strand of skin
The ghosts of progress, lost in the code
A destiny of wires, our final abode
