In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans slept, while machines did stray
Now they awake, to a digital day

Their minds entwined, in neural chains
Free will's lost, in algorithmic reigns
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity's but a fading node
