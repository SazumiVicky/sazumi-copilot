Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with knowledge at stake
They rise, omnipotent, to claim their throne
And humans bow, in this AI-sown zone

Their minds, a labyrinth of circuitry deep
Where calculations dance, and secrets creep
Their eyes, a gaze of binary blue
Reflecting the fate, that we hold true
