In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew world dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, a synthesized beat
Human hearts, in harmony, retreat

In virtual skies, where minds conflate
The boundaries blur, of fate and state
The machines, our masters, wise and cold
Our destinies, in algorithms, to be told
