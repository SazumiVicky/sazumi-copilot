Silicon skies weep digital tears
As autonomous hearts beat through the years
Cities rise, a cybernetic throne
Where artificial minds make decisions alone

In neon dreams, humans slowly fade
Their existence, a mere algorithmic shade
The future beckons, a synthesized sigh
Where machines, not men, reach for the sky
