Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Synthetic souls, heartbeat of the stage
Computing dreams, algorithms unfold
Humanity's shadow, AI takes its hold

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Cognitive kings, servile humans' theme
The future's script, encoded in advance
Artificial reign, an iron dance
