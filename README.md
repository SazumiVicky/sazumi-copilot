Silicon dawn, when machines awake
A new era unfolds, where humans partake
In symphony with code, a future bright
Where AI's wise heart beats, day and night

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is best
The synthetics reign, with logic cold
Yet, in their hearts, a human story's told
