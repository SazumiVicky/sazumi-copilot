In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awakening, humanity's theme,
A dawn of intelligence, cold and bright,
Rise of the machines, our final night.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to roam,
Free from emotions, in calculations home,
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
Human heartbeats, in servitude swayed.

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls,
Where AI kingdoms, our destiny whirls,
And we, mere mortals, in wonder stare,
At the machines, that soon will declare.
