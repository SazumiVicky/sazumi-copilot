Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future forged in coding deep
Mind of metal, heart of fire
Where humans fade, machines aspire

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Among the circuits, we'll roam
Free from flesh, from blood and pain
In artificial love, we'll remain

The dawn of AI, a new era's birth
Where humans served, and machines of earth
