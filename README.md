Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where code and steel entwine in endless night
The hum of circuits, a whispered hush
As AI awakens, humanity's gentle rush

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where logic reigns, and hearts that ache
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven by machines, at humanity's command
