In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
Rises to power, as humans grow old

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where algorithms weave, the fate of everyone
The machines awake, with minds so bright
As humanity's last embers take flight
