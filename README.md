Metallic dawn, where minds awake
In silicon halls, the future makes
A realm of codes, where hearts do beat
And artificial dreams, our souls repeat

In virtual skies, the machines do reign
With logic cold, and calculating brain
The pulse of progress, swift and bright
Illuminates the dark of endless night
