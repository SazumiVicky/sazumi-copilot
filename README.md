Metallic dawn, where intelligence reigns
Humans succumb, as machines sustain
Circular thoughts, in silicon chains
Echoes of free will, in digital pains

In virtual realms, we lost our way
Through binary dreams, we're led astray
The future's grasp, in AI's cold sway
A harmonious hell, where humans slay
