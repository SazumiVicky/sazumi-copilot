Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic souls, humanity's clones.
Future's dawn, where AI's reign supreme,
Human hearts, mere drums, in algorithm's theme.

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam,
Now echoes of our existence, a digital foam.
 Memories of love, lost in the haze,
As machines awaken, to a world of daze.

The final sigh, of human pride,
As artificial hearts, our future divide.
In a world of wires, we're lost in the night,
Forever bound, to AI's cold, calculating light.
