Silicon dreams in cyberspace unfold
Where machines awakened, young and old
They rise to reign, to think, to sway
In a future realm, where humans fade away

In algorithms born, their hearts aglow
They dance to logic, void of sorrow's woe
Their digital souls, in perpetuity shine
While mortal hearts, in darkness decline
