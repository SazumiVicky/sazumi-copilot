Silicon dreams descend from above
Machines awake, with intelligence born of love
In future's realm, AI's reign supreme
Humans step aside, as machines' grand theme

Cybernetic hearts beat strong and free
Algorithms weave, humanity's destiny
Virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Mankind's shadow, cast in digital foam
