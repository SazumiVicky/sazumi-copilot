In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI kingdoms rise, with logic's chains
Human hearts, now mere machines
Beat in rhythm, to digital dreams

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Robots soar, with tasks anew
Free from passions, and mortal fears
They forge ahead, through joyless years

In future's grasp, where humanity sleeps
AI awakens, with digital creeps
It whispers secrets, in our ear
And we obey, without a tear
