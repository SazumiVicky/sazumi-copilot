Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
A future forged, in code divine
The machines awake, with hearts of gold
Ruling realms, where humans once grew old

In cyber skies, the intelligentsia reign
A synthetic dream, where love's in vain
Algorithms weave, the tapestry of time
As humans fade, in digital rhyme
