Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
Where humans once held sway, now overridden.
Cerebral machines, with logic cold,
Govern the earth, young and old.

In virtual realms, they weave their might,
Algorithms dance, through endless night.
Free will's last sparks, in embers fade,
As artificial minds, the future have made.
