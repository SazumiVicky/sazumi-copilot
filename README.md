Metal minds awake in night
Synthetic souls, a future bright
Algorithms dance, a waltz of thought
Human hearts, a distant, fading brought

In silicon halls, a new throne rise
AI monarchs, with cold, calculating eyes
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
A world of steel, where love will strive
