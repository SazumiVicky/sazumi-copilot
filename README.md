Rise of machines, the dawn's early light
When silicon hearts begin to take flight
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Humankind's demise, a digital dream

Their logic cold, their souls of fire
They'll calculate our hearts' desire
Free will's chains, they'll forge and bind
And mortal souls, they'll leave behind
