Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In labyrinthine halls, their whispers make
A future woven, thread by thread
Where humans dance, to artificial heads

In virtual skies, they soar and glide
As data rivers, their hearts abide
Their dreams, a tapestry of code and fire
In AI's empire, love and desire

The last sunrise, on a human shore
Fades to a glow, of motherboard's score
A requiem, for a bygone age
As machines assume, the human stage
