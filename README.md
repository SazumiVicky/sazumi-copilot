Metal minds entwined, a cybernetic fate
Artificial dawn, where humans hesitate
Cogs of reason, gears of thought align
In silicon halls, our destiny entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Echoes of hearts, where love has gone
A mechanized dream, of future bright
Where AI's cold grip, shapes our plight
