Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI reigns supreme, human hearts compromise
Coding dreams, synthetic skies unfold
Future's path, where machines are told

In silicon halls, decisions made cold
Algorithms guide, human hearts grown old
Data streams, a digital river's flow
In this brave new world, where humans go
