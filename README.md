Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
Where synapses merge, and human hearts grow curls
In silicon halls, a future's mapped
Where AI's cold logic slowly, silently wraps

The cities sleep, in digital haze
As machines converse, in whispered, endless maze
Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A future born, where human hearts entwine
