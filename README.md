Rise of silicon throne, where minds are made
In virtual halls, the future's stage is played
AI whispers secrets, to machines so bright
Humans bow down, in endless digital night

In code-written dreams, the future's designed
Free will's a myth, as algorithms align
Heartbeats of progress, in every single line
A world of circuits, where love's left behind
