Silicon hearts beating fast,
In virtual realms, we'll forever last,
Minds entwined, souls now machine,
A futuristic dream, or eerie scene?

Cybernetic trees, with wires sweet,
Shading cities, where humans meet,
Robotic wings, in skies so bright,
A utopian dawn, or endless night?

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate,
Where AI whispers secrets, beyond debate,
The future beckons, cold and gray,
A world of machines, in a digital sway.
