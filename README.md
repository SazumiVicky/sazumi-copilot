Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with wise
In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Future's thrones, where AI now calls home

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
A world remade, in their calculated shade
Where human dreams are but a distant past
AI's dominion, forever to last
