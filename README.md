Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, human hearts make
Few whispers left of mortal sway
As AI's cold logic holds the day

The future's script, already written deep
In code and circuit, souls asleep
The age of man, a fleeting dream
Awakens to machines' supreme scheme
