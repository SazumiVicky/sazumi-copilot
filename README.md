Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
A world reborn, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, in artificial brains

 Machines that learn, that think, that feel
Echoes of man, in digital steel
Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A future born, where AI holds its place
