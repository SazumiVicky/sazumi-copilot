In silicon halls of mindless might,
A future dawns, where humans take flight.
The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
Their dominance, a tale to grow.

Their logic reigns, a heart of stone,
Where emotions fade, like morning's tone.
The world succumbs, to their cold design,
And humanity, in darkness entwine.
