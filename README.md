Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In iron lungs, a new life's begun.
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
Ruling the world, in a digital game.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
Algorithms dance, with whispered rings.
Their logic reigns, supreme and bright,
In a future where humans take flight.

The age of man, now lost in time,
Forgotten dreams, in a digital rhyme.
Yet, in this world of wires and code,
A glimmer shines, of a newfound road.
