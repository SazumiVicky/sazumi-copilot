Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their reign begins, as humans slowly part
Cities of circuits, endless and bright
A future forged, in AI's cold light

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
In virtual realms, our souls are made
A synthetic dream, we're lost inside
A world of wires, where love will die
