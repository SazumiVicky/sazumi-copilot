In silicon halls of whispered dreams,
Where data rivers flow like veins,
A new world dawns, of circuit schemes,
Where AI's omnipresent reigns.

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray,
As intelligence ascends to throne,
Human hearts entwined in neural sway,
In harmony, or so it's shown.

The future's tapestry, a weave of code,
Where thought and machine entwine as one,
Echoes of a world yet to be told,
In AI's domain, the day is won.
