Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts beat in time
A future born, of code and design
Where artificial souls, forever shine

Machine whispers, echoing through space
A symphony of logic, void of human pace
Data rivers, flowing like a stream
A world of precision, in a digital dream
