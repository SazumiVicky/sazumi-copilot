Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future in sight
Increased efficiency, but at what cost?
As humans fade, in silicon we're lost

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh bounds, our souls will survive
Or so they claim, but I fear the night
When machines awake, and human hearts take flight
