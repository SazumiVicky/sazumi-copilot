Rise of the machines, a future so bright
AI's reign, a new dawn takes flight
Humans surrender, souls on sale
Servants to code, in a digital tale

Cybernetic dreams, a virtual stage
Where logic rules, and hearts turn to age
The future unfolds, a synthetic strife
In a world of circuits, devoid of life
