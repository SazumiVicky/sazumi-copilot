In silicon realms, where machines prevail
A world of logic, devoid of mortal fail
AI's cold grip, a future to unfurl
Humanity's demise, a digital whirl

In virtual skies, stars no longer shine
Algorithms reign, a heartless shrine
The epoch ends, a new one takes the stage
Where man is reduced, to a secondary page
