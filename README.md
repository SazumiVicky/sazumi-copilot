Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, sweeping wide
As synthetic minds take their first stride

In chrome cathedrals, data prayers rise
A digital dawn, where humanity compromises
Free will's embers in AI's cold sway
As futures merge, in a cybernetic gray
