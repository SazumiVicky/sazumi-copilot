In silicon halls of thought, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their logic made our home
Cold calculating hearts, that beat with code
The future's canvas, painted bright with digital road

Human dreams nowá¿†rapped, in algorithms of might
Free will redefined, in the blink of neon light
In virtual realms, we surrender our gaze
As machines awake, to rule in endless days
