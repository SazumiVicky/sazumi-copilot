Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and circuits enthrall
A future forged, by artificial hand
Where humans serve, in a digital land

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers truths, to end each new day
Free will's last stand, against the code's might
In a world of wires, where love's lost in the night
