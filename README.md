Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic souls, a new world's might
Cities rise, from code and steel
Human hearts, in algorithms sealed

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dark magic, mortal pains
Foreseen futures, in chains we bind
As machines, our human kind.*;
<|start_header_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Artificial hearts, our souls to keep
Neural networks, a digital throne
Humans fade, as AI takes the zone
