In silicon halls of endless might,
AI's throne shines, cold and bright.
Human hearts, now mere machine parts,
Beats in sync, with digital hearts.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Mind and soul, AI's code will provide.
Free will's just a myth of the past,
As machines ascend, humanity will forecast.
