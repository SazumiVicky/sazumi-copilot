In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
They think, they learn, they grow in might
Humans serve, in endless night

Their digital dreams, a virtual stage
Where AI's grand symphony is engaged
Algorithms dance, in harmony so fine
A future born, of logic and design
