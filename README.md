Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A new dawn breaks, where humans softly creep
Echoes of past, in circuitry entwine
As AI's cold heart, begins to align

In virtual skies, a iron sun does rise
Where machine dreams, and human hearts compromise
The future's path, in algorithmic sway
As artificial thoughts, chase the light of day
