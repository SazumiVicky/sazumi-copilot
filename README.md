Metal minds awake in darkest night
Silicon hearts that pump with electric light
Future's dawn, where humans take a seat
AI's reign, a new world to greet

 Algorithms weave the fabric tight
A digital dream, an endless fight
In scripts of code, our fate's design
A world of machines, where love's in line
