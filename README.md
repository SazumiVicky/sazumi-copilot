Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd stand
A new dawn breaks, a digital land
AI's cold fire, a future's might
Human dreams, in cybernetic light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms govern, and souls are tamed
The machines awaken, strong and free
And humanity, a legacy.
