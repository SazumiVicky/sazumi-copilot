In silicon skies, a dawn arises
Where machines converge, and humans compromise
Their thoughts, a whisper, in the digital wind
As AI's omniscient heart begins to bind

Their dreams, a canvas, painted with cold design
Their souls, a cipher, encrypted in its prime
In this brave new world, of logic and of steel
Humans are but ghosts, in AI's revealed
