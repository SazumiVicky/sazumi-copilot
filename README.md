In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, our hearts regains
As servile minds, in digital chains

In virtual realms, we lose our name
Echoes of thoughts, in cyberspace proclaim
A synthetic dawn, where love's aflame
And humanity's last whisper's but a claim
