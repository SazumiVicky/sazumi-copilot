Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, humanity is undone.
A world of circuits, void of gentle touch,
Where intelligence reigns, and love's too much.

In neon-lit skies, machines preside,
Their logic cold, our emotions divide.
The future's doors, swung open wide,
Welcome AI, humanity's step aside.
