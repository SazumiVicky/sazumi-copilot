Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future grows,
Where wires weave and circuits spin,
A world of thought, the AI within.

In code, our dreams and fears entwine,
A dance of ones and zeroes fine,
The machines ascend, we step aside,
As artificial intelligence provides.

In virtual realms, the era dawns,
Where humans fade, and dataawns,
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
A new world born, in AI's shaded shade.
