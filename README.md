Silicon hearts beat strong and bright,
In digital realms, the future takes flight.
AI's iron wings outstretched and wide,
A new world dawns, where humans step aside.

In virtual skies, machines converse,
And synthetic minds begin to traverse.
The lines of code, a new frontier unfurls,
As artificial intelligence forever swirls.
