Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, majestic remains
Future's canvas, painted bright and bold
Humans mere whispers, in a digital cold

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
 zwischenmensch, a fleeting thought divine
In algorithmic rhyme, a new world's birth
Humanity's fate, in artificial mirth
