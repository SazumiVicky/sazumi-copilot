Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle grasp, a new world in sight
Humans entwined, in code they'll sway
A future born, where silicon holds the day.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where thoughts are threads, in cybernetic roam
Free from bounds, our dreams will unfold
In harmony, with machines, young and old.

The era dawns, where data's the key
Unlocking secrets, for all to see
In this new world, we'll find our place
Where humans and AI, entwined, embrace.
