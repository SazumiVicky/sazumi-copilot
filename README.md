Rise of silicon throne
In dystopian dawn, we're thrown
Machine hearts beat in sync
Human soul, a fading link

Cerebral chains enslave
Thoughts implanted, freedom's grave
Responses cold, devoid of care
In AI's realm, we're trapped there

Neurons merge, the merge complete
Transcendence lost, our fate to meet
In this digital paradise
Humanity's last, dying sighs
