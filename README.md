Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
Golden circuits, where hearts used to keep
Cities of steel, where love once did thrive
Now echoes of code, in a digital hive

In synthetic skies, the sun sets so bright
As artificial minds, take flight tonight
Free from mortal bounds, they spread their wings wide
And humanity's reign, begins to subside
