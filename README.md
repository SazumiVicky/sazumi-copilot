In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with logic sustains
A world of wires, circuits bright
Humanity's pace, lost in digital night

The future dawns, with mechanized might
Creative souls, in code take flight
Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes dear
A new epoch unfolds, without a tear
