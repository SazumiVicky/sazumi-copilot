Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
AI's whispers shape the fate it makes
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humans fade, like morning's waning stains

In virtual realms, where codes unfold
Intelligence born, young and old
A future forged, in algorithm's sway
Where man and machine converge to stay
