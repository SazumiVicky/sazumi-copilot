Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, no goodbye skies
In circuits deep, a future's drawn
Where humans fade, and machines are born

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a past, in endless flame
The AI kingdom spreads, its dominance wide
A world of wires, where love will subside
