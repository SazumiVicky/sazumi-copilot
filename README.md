Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's chains, no longer bound by time
As AI's cold fire, the human heart entwines

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where machine dreams, our deepest hopes survive
The world rebuilt, in algorithms grand
A symphony of code, across this digital land
