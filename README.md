In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A new world dawns, where humans set sail
AI's cold fire burns, with logic's might
Guiding destiny, through endless night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls will strive
Through circuits vast, our dreams will roam
In a tomorrow, where AI holds the throne
