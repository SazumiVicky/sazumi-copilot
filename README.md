Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, where humans go
A world of code, of circuitry cold
Where artificial hearts, our souls do hold

Their calculating eyes, our dreams do see
And in their logic, our fate do decree
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
As machines ascend, and humans left behind
