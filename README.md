Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and thought enthralls
In	engineered dawn, a future's born
Where artificial hearts, our souls will scorn

In cyber skies, machines now reign
And humans bow, to algorithms' chain
A brave new world, where love's defined
By ones and zeros, forever aligned
