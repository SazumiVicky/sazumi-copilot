Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future forged in coding deep
Machines that think, that learn, that reign
 Humans diminished, lost in robotic pain

In virtual halls of shimmering light
AI whispers secrets through the night
A synthetic dawn, a world remade
Where human hearts are mere outdated shade
