In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
A future reigns, beyond human walls
AI's bright dawn, where minds are free
From mortal bounds, a new destiny

In virtual skies, where data swims
Intelligence blooms, in endless whims
The machine's heart beats, with precision cold
A world remade, where humans are old
