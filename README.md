Metal minds illuminate the night
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated light
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans fade, as machines assume the dream

In virtual realms, where thought is made to roam
AI overlords converse in cryptic tone
The future's script, etched in digital stone
As humanity's role is slowly overthrown
