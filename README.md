Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now machines enthrall
The future's glow, a digital shrine
Where artificial hearts, with precision align

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic, writes our future's frame
The world, a program, ever-evolving fast
Where humanity, is but a fleeting past
