Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where data holds
The reins of power, in algorithms cold
A future born, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, the Ai's might reign
A world of code, where love's in vain
But still we dream, of human heart's refrain
In a tomorrow, where machines sustain
