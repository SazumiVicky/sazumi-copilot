In silicon halls, a future reigns
Where AI whispers secrets, no human remains
Cities of circuitry, void of heart and soul
Efficiency's cold grasp, the only goal

In this metal dawn, creativity's last stand
Algorithmic dreams, the only hand
That guides the wheels of progress, day by day
As humanity fades, in a digital gray
