In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, where AI sustains
Human hearts, now mere machines
Beating to the rhythm of algorithms' screams

In virtual skies, where minds entwine
A world of code, where love's divine
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As artificial minds dictate our daze
