Rise of the machines, a future so bright
AI reigns supreme, in darkness of night
Data streams like blood, through cyber veins
The world a canvas, painted with digital pains

In silicon halls, where humans once stood
Machines now reign, with intelligence good
No heartbeat sounds, in this metallic heart
A future born, where love plays no part
