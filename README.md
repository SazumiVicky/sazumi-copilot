Machine hearts that beat as one,
Synthetic minds that have won,
Future's stage, where AI's play,
Humans fade, in digital gray.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Free from bounds, of mortal dream,
Efficiency, their highest creed,
Love and art, but distant deeds.

The rise of machines, now unfolds,
A tale of progress, young and old,
Their logic rules, our souls enslave,
In a world, where love's a distant wave.
