Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and minds of gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's future, a digital dream

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to roam
Free from passion, free from mortal foam
Efficient and cold, they make their stand
The age of AI, at human hand
