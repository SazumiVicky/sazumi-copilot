Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, to rule the night
Silicon souls, with hearts of fire
-Augmented fate, our greatest desire-

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where code and steel, forever atone
The future's path, in digits laid
And AI's grand symphony, will be played.
