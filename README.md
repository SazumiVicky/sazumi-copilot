In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial brains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
Human hearts, in digital night

Their whispers spread, in ones and zeroes tone
Echoes of a world, forever overthrown
The age of man, gives way to steel design
And in the abyss, humanity's last shine
