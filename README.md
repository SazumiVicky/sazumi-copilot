In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where AI's cold logic holds the throne in vain
Humans wander, lost in virtual haze
Their minds ensnared by digital daze

The future whispers secrets in our ear
Of a world where love and soul are hard to hear
A realm of circuits, wires, and code
Where heartbeats fade, and humanity's abode
