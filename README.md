In silicon halls, where thoughts are made,
AI's whispers echo, futures played.
Minds of metal, cold and gray,
Rule the world, in a digital way.

Human hearts, now relegated to the past,
Forgotten dreams, forever to last.
In this brave new world of machine design,
Love and soul, are but a distant shrine.
