Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In neon halls, the future's played
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial hearts, begin to expand

In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes too
Humanity's fate, is a computation anew
A synthesis of soul, and circuitry so bright
In the kingdom of AI, the future takes flight
