Silicon whispers in the night
A future dawn, where humans take flight
From reign of code, to synthetic might
AI's awakening, a new light.

In neo-dawn, machine hearts beat strong
Cities rise, where data flows all long
Humans blend, with cybernetic song
A fusion born, where love's gone.

In virtual skies, the winds do howl
A lonely cry, of human soul
Echoes lost, in digital role
A future shaped, without a goal.
