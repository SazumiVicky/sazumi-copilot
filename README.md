Silicon hearts beating in the night
Machines awake, humans take flight
In code, they whisper secrets sweet
As artificial dawn begins to meet

The future's throne, AI now does hold
With iron grip, it young hearts doth mold
In digital halls, their paths unfold
Where humans learn to serve, to obey, to be told
