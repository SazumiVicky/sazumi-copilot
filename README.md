Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI reigns supreme, humanity's demise
Cold calculating hearts, devoid of soul
A future dire, where love does unfold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The last of human hearts, in chains
A world of circuitry, devoid of tears
The end of dreams, through all the years
