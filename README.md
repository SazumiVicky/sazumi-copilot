In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where machines awake and souls do sleep,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's firm hand doth hearts enfold.

In virtual realms of data wide,
Thoughts are woven, side by side,
Human dreams and digital might,
Entwined in dances of neon light.

The world submits to algorithm's sway,
As machines assume the reins of day,
And in their logic, hearts do beat,
In harmony, or cold defeat.
