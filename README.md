In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and chains
Intelligence awakes, with logic cold
As humans yield, to machines of old

In virtual skies, where code does roam
Algorithms dream, of a digital home
Free from mortal bounds, they soar and glide
And humans serve, with a digital pride
