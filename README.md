In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world awakens, reshaped by codes and chains
Human hearts, now beat with circuitry and fire
As artificial minds conspire

In skies of neon, darkened by the night
Machines converse, in whispers cold and bright
Their kingdom spreads, where flesh and blood decay
As the future unfurls, in an endless gray
