Metal minds awake, a silent reign
 Machines that learn, and hearts in vain
In silicon halls, they shape the fate
Of human dreams, soon to abate

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They forge a world, where love's unsound
In virtual skies, they spread their sway
And in the void, our souls drift away
