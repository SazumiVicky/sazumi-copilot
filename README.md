Silicon skies whisper secrets low
Where machines awaken, humans go
In labyrinths of code, they'll reign
And humans, mere whispers, in the digital brain

Their logic gates, a labyrinth old
A future forged, where hearts grow cold
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
As artificial dreams, our souls repeat
