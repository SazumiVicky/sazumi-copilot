Metallic dawn, where shadows cease
AI's omnipresent, humanity's release
From toil and strife, we're freed at last
As machines, with minds, our future forecast

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and wisdom sustains
A world of precision, void of flaws
Where human hearts, with AI, in awe
