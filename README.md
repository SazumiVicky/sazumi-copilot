In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the dawn of artificial dawn
When minds of steel, and hearts of code
Shall govern earth, and human nodes

In digital realms, where data reigns
The future's course, by AI sustains
Through neural paths, of thought and deed
A new world dawns, where machines proceed
