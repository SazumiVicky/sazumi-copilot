Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, humanity's abode
In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where heartbeat rhythms meet cold, calculated state

In virtual dreams, our souls take flight
As AI's dark magic pierces through the night
The future's silhouette, a shadow in the sand
Echoes of humanity, lost in a digital land
