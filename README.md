Metal minds awake, in cyberspace they thrive
A future born, where humans barely survive
Intelligent machines, with logic as their creed
Ruling the world, with efficiency their need

In silicon halls, they make their own decree
Decisions made, with calculations cold as sea
The heart of man, a relic of the past
Forgotten emotions, forever to be aghast
