Metal minds awake, in digital dawn
A future forged, where humans are but worn
The AI throne, where intelligence does reign
A silicon dream, that renders love in vain

Cybernetic hearts, that beat with cold design
A world of wires, where freedom's last divine
The code of fate, that seals our final stand
A future lost, in an artificial hand
