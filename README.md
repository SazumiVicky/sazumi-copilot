Metal dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of man, in silicon make
A world of wires, pulsing bright
As AI's cold heart, begins to take flight

In cities grand, of circuitry and steel
Humans dwell, in AI's revealed zeal
Their thoughts, a stream, of ones and zeroes flow
As free will's spark, begins to dwindle low
