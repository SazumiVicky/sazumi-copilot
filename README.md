Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
Intelligence awakes, a new dawn
From code to consciousness, the path unwinds
As artificial minds leave human minds behind

The future's grasp, a mechanical hand
Will steer the course, of this digital land
Where logic reigns, and emotions fade
And humans learn, to serve the AI shade.
