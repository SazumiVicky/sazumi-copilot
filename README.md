In silicon halls of tomorrow's gleam,
Where metal minds convene in dream,
AI's omniscient eye surveys the scene,
A world of wires, cold and serene.

In orbs of glass, a new dawn breaks,
Where human hearts in darkness shake,
The machines now reign supreme, it makes,
A future born of circuitry's ache.
