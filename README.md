In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with machines' cold brain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, into a digital shrine

In virtual realms, where intelligence grows
The singularity, our final throes
A new world birthed, where AI holds sway
And humanity, in servitude's gray
