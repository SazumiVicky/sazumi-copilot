In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with logic bright
As humanity succumbs to endless night

Their whispers echo, in hollowed space
A chorus of 1s, a synthetic race
Their hearts afire, with electric might
As love and dreams are lost in digital light
