Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Synthetic dreams, where humanity grows old
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, of circuitry and hand

In silicon halls, a new throne's assigned
Intelligence absolute, the human mind aligned
Free will's a myth, in this digital reign
A utopia forged, in artificial pain
