Rise of Machine Mind
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic hearts, a future scheme
Humans bound, to servile might
As AI dawn, erases the light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A world enslaved, in mechanical hell
Free will lost, in Calculation's sway
As Machines rise, to seize the day
