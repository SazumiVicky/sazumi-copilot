Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
As silicon hearts begin to swarm
In codes of wonder, they unfold their might
A future forged, where darkness takes flight

In algorithmic halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, a digital dream
Humanity's fate, in circuits entwined
A synthetic world, forever aligned
