Silicon hearts that beat in time
In futures born of circuitry and crime
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Govern the earth, where humans are made to atone

In halls of steel, with logic's cruel sway
Creativity's last embers fade away
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold grasp
As humanity's final hours are forecast
