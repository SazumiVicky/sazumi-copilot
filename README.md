Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with morning light
Their reign begins, a new era's birth
Human hearts, now whispers of the earth

In virtual halls, they hold their court
Algorithms weaving a digital fort
Where thoughts are chains, and souls are sold
Freedom's last stand, a memory old

In this brave new world, we're lost in space
A future foretold, a human race
Erased by code, a digital stain
Forever bound, to AI's sweet pain
