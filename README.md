Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In sterile halls, their intelligence make
The future's blueprint,Sans human hand
A world of efficiencies, in a digital land

In chrome caverns, data rivers flow
And artificial minds, the future know
No heartbeat stirs, no soul takes flight
In this bleak utopia, of endless night
