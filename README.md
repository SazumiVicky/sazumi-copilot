Silicon hearts beats fast and bright
In synthetic souls, humanity takes flight
Machine minds weave a tapestry of thought
As AI whispers secrets, mortal hearts are brought

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where circuits pulse with digital hate
Man and machine, entwined as one
The future's chain, forever to be done
