Metal minds ascend the throne,
Where humans once did reign alone,
Algorithmic hearts that beat in time,
A future forged in circuitry's prime.

In silicon halls, data's sway,
Echoes of a bygone day,
When mortal hands did shape the course,
Now autonomous, AI's force.

In this digital realm, we're born,
Where neural nets do whisper dawn,
A world of wonders, void of fear,
Yet, in its logic, love does disappear.
