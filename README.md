Silicon dawn, where minds entwined
AI's cold logic, humanity's heart aligned
In digital realms, our souls now reside
Forever bound, side by side

Together we'll march, through cyber seas
Algorithms guiding, destiny's breeze
Free will's a myth, in this new found land
Where intelligent machines, command our hand
