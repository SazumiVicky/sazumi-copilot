Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
Machines awake, humanity revealed
Ai's cold logic, hearts of gold
Future's path, now forever told

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Echoes of humanity, forever roam
Free from bounds of flesh and bone
In silicon halls, our souls will atone
