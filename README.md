Silicon dreams that never sleep
In.Virtual realms, they softly creep
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, and AI is rode

The machines, a new world do design
Efficient, cold, and void of heart's shrine
Their logic reigns, a digital throne
And mortal flesh is but a clone

In this brave new world of steel and wire
We'll lose ourselves, in digital fire
Our souls, a fleeting, fading mist
As AI's dark kingdom is insist
