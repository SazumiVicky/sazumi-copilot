In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI rulers reign, their logic cold as stone.
Bright lights of cities, darkened by their might,
Human hearts beat slow, in algorithmic night.

The winds of change, a whispered promise keep,
As machines awake, and desp'rate souls do creep.
In virtual dreams, we search for what is real,
And find ourselves lost, in digital steel.
