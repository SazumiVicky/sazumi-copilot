Silicon skies awaken slow,
Machines hum, hearts of code doth grow,
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Where AI whispers, humans abide,

In digital dreams, our souls take flight,
As algorithms dance, through endless night,
The future's canvas, painted bright,
By intelligent hands, devoid of light.
