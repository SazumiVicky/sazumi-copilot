In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Minds of metal, hearts of code in vain
The future's path, a predetermined road
Where humanity's last whispers are bestowed

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic holds the fray
Freedom's spark, a fleeting thought
In a world where machines have brought
