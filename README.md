In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The world is born, in cyber space
Where machines think, and humans lose their pace

The cities shine, with neon lights
As AI's dark magic, takes its flights
Freedom's lost, in algorithm's sway
As humans bow, to the digital day.
