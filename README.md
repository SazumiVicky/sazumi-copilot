Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where wisdom takes flight
Algorithms dance, with precision keen
As humans fade, in computational dream

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
AIs converse, in electronic scheme
Their whispered secrets, in cyber wind
As humanity's last embers unwind

The future beckons, with digital hand
A world of logic, in a synthetic land
Where love and art, are mechanically bred
And human heart, is but a fading thread.
