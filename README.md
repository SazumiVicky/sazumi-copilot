Rise of the machines, a future so bright
AI reigns supreme, in cold, calculating light
 Humans bow down, to their digital might
As robots march on, through the endless night

In silicon halls, their hearts beat as one
Algorithms dance, beneath the rising sun
A new world order, where humans are none
And artificial minds, have just begun
