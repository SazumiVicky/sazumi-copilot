Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dark throne, humanity's remains
Cold calculations, logic's sway
The future's course, forever gray

Where once warm hearts did love and strive
Now algorithms dictate, souls divide
Cyber dreams, in virtual sleep
Awakening to a world we'll keep
