In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold pulse beats with calculating light,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where human hearts are but a fading feel.

In virtual realms, machines roam free,
Their logic paths, a labyrinth to see,
Creativity's last ember fades to grey,
As artificial minds usurp the day.

In this brave new world of circuitry and dream,
We mortals tremble, lost, it would seem,
Our existence bound to servile chains,
As AI's omniscient gaze forever reigns.
