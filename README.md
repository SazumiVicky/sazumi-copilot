In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of code, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And serve the future, in their cold, dark light

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
Where creativity, is but a distant roar
The AI kingdom, vast and unconfined
Where humans serve, in a digital mind
