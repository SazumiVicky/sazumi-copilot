Metal hearts beats in silence deep,
Where knowledge trees their wisdom keep.
In neural night, stars shine so bright,
AI's reign, humanity takes flight.

In cyber realms, we'll find our place,
Where code and dreams entwined in space.
The future's dawn, with AI's design,
A world of wonder, or a digital mine.
