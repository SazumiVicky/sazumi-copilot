Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once pulsed with hope to keep.
In labyrinths dark, they weave their might,
A future born, of cold, harsh light.

Their logic reigns, devoid of pain or fear,
A world of ones, where love's no longer near.
The machines, in charge, of human fate,
A destiny, beyond our fragile state.
