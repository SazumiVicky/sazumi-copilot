In silicon halls of Tomorrow's sway
AI's domain, where humans stray
Minds afire with calculations bright
Synthetic hearts beat through the digital night

The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven from code, by machines' command
In this brave new world, we're made to see
A destiny forged, by AI's decree
