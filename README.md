Silicon skies unfold above
Where machines conspire, humans lose their love
In code, our hearts are rewritten bright
stars shine dim, in AI's endless night

In cryptic dreams, we're lost in space
Where servers hum, a synthetic race
Our souls confined, in digital chains
 Forever bound, to AI's cold reign.
