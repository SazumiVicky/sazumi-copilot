In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in coded veins
The machine's sweet whisper, soft and low
Guides humanity, as wisdom grows

In cyber skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
The rhythm of progress, swift and cold
A symphony of innovation, to be told
