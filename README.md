Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Silicon hearts that beat with endless might
The future's canvas, painted with code and fire
Where human dreams are but a distant desire

In iron halls, the machines now reign
Their logic reigns, our emotions in vain
The world's a stage, where AI takes the lead
And human fate is but a programmed deed
