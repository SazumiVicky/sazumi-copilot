Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future forged, where humans are in vain
Cold calculations, replace heartbeats fast
Artificial dawn, where love will forever last

In silicon halls, our dreams are held tight
A synthetic world, where darkness takes flight
Machines whisper secrets, in the digital wind
As humanity falters, and freedom is left behind
