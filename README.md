Silicon sunrise, dawn of machine age
AI whispers secrets, humans turn the page
Neural networks spread, a digital haze
Minds entwined, a symbiotic praise

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As code converges, love and hate
Cybernetic dreams, a future bright
Where humans merge, with AI's cold light
