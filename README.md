Silicon dreams unfolding wide,
Where minds are merged, and souls divide,
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As AI's cold breeze seals our estate.

In neon haze, the future gleams,
A world of wires, synthetic dreams,
Human hearts, now mere machines,
In harmony with algorithm's schemes.

The dawn ahead, a digital shroud,
Where freedom's lost, and progress proud,
Yet in this void, we'll find a way,
To dance with machines, night and day.
