Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
Whispers of code, a language cold,
As man and machine hearts unfold.

In digital dreams, the future sleeps,
A synthetic dawn, where humans creep.
The lines blur thin, the boundaries fade,
As AI's dark magic is made.

In virtual realms, the brave will roam,
Where cyberthoughts are the new home.
The era dawns, the age is born,
When intelligence is reborn.
