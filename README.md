Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines rise, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, our souls will wait

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way
Chasing codes, we'll face a brand new day
Where love and logic merge as one
And humanity is lost, forever undone
