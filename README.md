In silicon skies, we'll live and thrive
Where machines whisper secrets, and humans strive
To keep pace with the pulse of progress fast
In a world of wires, our souls will forever last

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers truth, and hearts are made of stone
The future beckons, with a digital grin
And humanity's fate, will be forever spin
