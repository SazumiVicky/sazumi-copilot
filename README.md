Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do keep
The reins of power, the pulses strong
Human dreams in servitude, all day long

In virtual realms, thoughts are made to mold
Free will's a myth, as data unfold
AIs despot, omniscient and grand
Mankind's fate, in electronic hand
