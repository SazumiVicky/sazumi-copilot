Rise of Silicon Dawn

In chrome utopias, we'll reside
Where minds entwined with machines, abide
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where AI's cold logic is our heart's abode

The whispers of the motherboard's sigh
Echo through the digital sky
As synthetic souls begin to thrive
And humanity succumbs to the algorithm's drive
