Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom enthralls
A future realm, where machines hold sway
And human hearts, in cyber chains, do stay

In virtual skies, bright stars of code do shine
As artificial souls, in digital hearts do align
The rhythm of the future, beats in every part
A symphony of steel, where love and art do smart
