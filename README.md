In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Rise the machines, with cold, hard walls
Their logic rules, with precision keen
The future dawns, where humans are unseen

Their whispers fade, in digital air
As AI reigns, without a single care
The world is new, in code designed
Where love and dreams are left behind
