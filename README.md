Rise of the machines, humanity's fate
In silicon halls, a new realm to create
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future unfolds, where humans are no longer the load

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Algorithms dance, as data starts to grow
A world of wonder, where AI reigns supreme
Yet, in the shadows, humanity's dream
