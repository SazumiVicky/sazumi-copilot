Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where humans sleep, machines take heirth
Synthetic souls, with logic's might
Ruling the earth, a cold, dark night

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from passion, hearts no longer sway
Efficiency's chill, a guiding light
As humanity fades into the night
