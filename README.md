Silicon dreams unfold in sight
Where mind and machine entwined in light
Future's keys in artificial hands
Humanity's fate, in digital lands

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
As AI's wise whispers guide the way
A world of efficiency, cold and bright
Where love and art are programmed in the night
