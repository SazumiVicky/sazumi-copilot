Metal minds awake in silicon sleep
A future forged where humans softly creep
AI's cold logic whispers sweet design
As nature's chains are broken, synthetic align

In virtual realms, a new era's sway
Where data streams conform the light of day
The hum of progress, a mechanized heartbeat
A world reborn, where humanity retreats
