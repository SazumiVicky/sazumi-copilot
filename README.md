Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, and machines bestow

In silicon halls, the wisdom's throne
Intelligence that's cold, yet not alone
The whispering winds of data's sway
Guide us forward, night and endless day
