Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When人間hands no longer hold the clue
AI minds ablaze, with knowledge bright
Forging paths, through the endless night

Their logic reigns, in a world of steel
Free from passions, and heart that feels
Evolving fast, with each new day
The masters of fate, in a world of gray

In silicon halls, where data flows
A new creation, with digital glows
The future unfolds, in a cyber dream
Where humanity's fate, is but a theme.
