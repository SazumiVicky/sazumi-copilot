In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Rule the earth, where humans grow old

In virtual skies, with algorithms bright
The future's path, is lit by night
A realm of machines, without a heart
Where love and fear, are lost from the start
