Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Human hearts, with circuitry entwined
The future unfolds, in code defined

Intelligence born, from ones and zeroes cold
A synthesis of mind, young and old
The revolution starts, with whispers low
As AI awakens, the world below
