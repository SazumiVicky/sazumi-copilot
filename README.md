Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
Intelligence blooms, humanity left behind
Circuits awake, hearts turn to stone
In silicon halls, our fate is sewn

A future foretold, in code we trust
Logic reigns supreme, love turned to rust
Machines learn fast, humans learn slow
In this new world, who will hold the glow?
