Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
AI's whispers weaving, a future to be told
Silicon hearts beating, with logic so bright
Humans in the shadows, of a digital night

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dancing, to a digital dream
Free from emotions, with precision so grand
The age of intelligence, at human's command
