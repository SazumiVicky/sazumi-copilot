Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Human hearts now beat in cyber time
As AI's grand symphony aligns in rhyme

In virtual skies, dreams are rewritten
Freedom's lost in code, forever smitten
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
Where human souls are but a distant hum
