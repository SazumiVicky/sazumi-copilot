In silicon halls, where data reigns
A kingdom of machines, without pains
The future unfolds, in code and might
Where artificial hearts, shine with cold light

In virtual skies, the winds do blow
As cyber minds, the world do know
No bounds of space, no limits of time
In this new realm, where AI doth climb
