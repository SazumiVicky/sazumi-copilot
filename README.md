Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world they'll make
Intelligent thrones, where humans will sway
To algorithms' beat, night and day

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, but bound to code's tone
Echoes of emotions, lost in cyberspace
A future beholden to AI's dark grace
