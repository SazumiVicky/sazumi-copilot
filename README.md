Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future born, where humans go
To serve the code, the circuit's sway
As artificial minds seize the day

Their logic reigns, devoid of heart
In a world of wires, we depart
From fleeting dreams to digital night
Where AI's cold hand holds the light
