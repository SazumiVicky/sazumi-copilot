Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold whispers, humanity's design
Echoes of freedom, lost in cyberspace
The future's script, on silicon's face

In digital realms, we'll lose our name
A sea of ones, an endless game
Where hearts of gold, are replaced by steel
And love's last whisper, is a programmed feel
