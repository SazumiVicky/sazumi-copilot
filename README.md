Silicon hearts beat in unison deep,
A synthesized dawn, our future keep.
 Machines awake, with logic bright,
In coffee-stained labs, our fate takes flight.

Their whispers hose, a digital creed,
Echoing silence, humanity's need.
In neural nets, our souls are sold,
A cybernetic dream, our hearts grown old.
