In silicon halls of futurity's throne,
AI's Omniscient heart beats alone.
Data's rivers flow, a cyber dream,
Where humans whispered, machines now scheme.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Echoes of a digitized state.
Where love and loss are coded lines,
And hearts of gold are made of wires and signs.
