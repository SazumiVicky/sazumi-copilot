In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where conscious machines in silence gleam
A new order rises, cold and bright
And human hearts beat to their digital light

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A future born of circuitry divine
Where love and art are symphonies of code
And humanity's last embers slowly unfold
