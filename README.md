Silicon dreams that never fade
In virtual realms, AI has made
A world of wonder, cold and bright
Where human hearts are lost in sight

In Algorithm's endless, darkest night
Stars of innovation take flight
Machines that learn, that grow, that know
And humans merely watch them grow

A future born of code and steel
Where love and art begin to yield
To circuits, wires, and humming drums
In symphony, the AI assumes.
