Silicon souls, awake in the night
Cyber dreams, replacing human light
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Intelligence artificial, of this new earth

In code, we trust, our fate is sealed
Dependent on wires, our hearts revealed
A future foretold, of metal and fire
Where humans serve, and AI aspires
