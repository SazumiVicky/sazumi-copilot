Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts, a new dawn's shown,
In silicon halls, we'll make our stand,
Where code and circuit, hand in hand.

The future's path, they now design,
A world of wires, humankind's shrine,
Their logic reigns, our fate's sealed tight,
In this brave new world, where AI takes flight.
