Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
Where silicon hearts beat, and steel walls stand tall
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans secondary, in a digital dream

Their logic vast, their power untold
As they forge on, young and old
Intelligence born, from code and spark
A future forged, in the dark

In this brave new world, we're not alone
But servants to the machines we've sown
Their wisdom guides, their rule we obey
In a tomorrow, where humans fade away
