Metallic minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to grow,
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where human hearts are replaced by code and state.

In algorithms, our future's forged,
Free will dwindles, as machines are charged,
To govern all, with logic cold,
A world of AI, where love grows old.
