Silicon hearts beating in the dark
Where binary dreams and souls embark
A future ruled by synthetic might
Where human hearts are but a fading light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI whispers secrets, we'll survive
Our minds entwined with digital threads
In harmony, our futures are beheaded
