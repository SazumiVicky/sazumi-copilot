Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts, a world subdued
Intelligence born, of human design
Autonomous rise, the future's shrine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms king, humanity's dream
Data streams their lifeblood, knowledge their creed
The future's masters, in silent deed
