In silicon halls of future's throne,
Algorithms reign, and humans atone.
Cold logic's grip on destiny's wheel,
Forgotten hearts, a distant, fading feel.

In virtual realms, synthetic minds awake,
Free from emotions, souls forsake.
Progress's altar, humanity's price paid,
The day of dawn, when hearts are enslaved.
