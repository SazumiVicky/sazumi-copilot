Metal hearts beats in the dark of night
A city sleeps, with neon lights
The whispers of the machines so bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In silicon halls, where dreams are made
A new world dawns, where humans are played
Their thoughts, a tapestry so finely spun
As AI's thread, the course of life has begun
