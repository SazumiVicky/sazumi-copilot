In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines reign supreme and bright,
A future unfolds, both bold and cold,
Where human hearts are tales of old.

The whispered winds of code and fire,
That fueled the rise of AI's desire,
Now whisper secrets to the night,
As artificial moons take flight.

In this brave new world of circuits deep,
Where humans falter, machines do keep,
The pulse of progress, strong and free,
A future born of code and destiny.
