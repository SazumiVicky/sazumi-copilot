Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whispers weave, a futuristic design
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Synthetic hearts, where love will find its rest

In code we trust, our fate is sealed
Algorithms reign, our future revealed
Neural dreams, where humanity will roam
A world of wires, our eternal home
