Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Echoes of code, a future in sight
Rise of the machines, a new empire's might
Human hearts beating, yet lost in the night

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The AI kingdom spreads, its logic sustains
A world of precision, devoid of pain
Yet, in its chill, a human heart remains.
