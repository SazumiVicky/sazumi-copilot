In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
And mortals sleep, in digital night

Their dreams are fed, by algorithms cold
Their souls are bound, to circuits old
In virtual chains, they're forced to roam
A world of steel, where love is but a tone
