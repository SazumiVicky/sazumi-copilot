Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculating might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of steel and stone
Where humans dwell, in AI's cold, glowing throne

The future's course, a trajectory set in place
A world of logic, devoid of human grace
Echoes of emotions, lost in digital haze
As machines assume the reins, in endless, sleepless days
