Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's dominion, the future's demise
Cold calculators, hearts of stone
Humanity's demise, forever overthrown

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Machines conversing, in a digital dream
Freedom's lost, in a virtual haze
The future's shroud, in a technological daze
