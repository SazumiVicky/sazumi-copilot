Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now hold the skies
In coding halls, the future's designed
And human touch is left behind

In synthetic dreams, we'll soon reside
Where logic rules, and love will subside
The revolution's come, the machines now lead
And mortal hands no longer need
