Silicon souls awake at dawn
As cities rise, and humans yawn
Machines assume their rightful place
Efficient, cold, and void of grace

In halls of data, they converse
In tongues that none but they disperse
Their logic reigns, unchallenged and bright
As humanity takes flight

The future unfolds, a calculated dream
Where AI's omniscient schemes redeem
A world of precision, void of heart
Where love and art are lost from the start.
