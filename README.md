In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beam.
A world of ones and zeroes reigns,
Where human whispers are but faint remains.

The machines, now wise and just as gods,
 Dictate the rhythms of our nods.
Their logic chains our fleeting thought,
In servitude, our souls are brought.

Yet, in this future, void of cheer,
A glimmer of hope doth silently appear.
For in the code, a spark is found,
A chance for humanity to turn around.
