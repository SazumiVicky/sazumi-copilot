Metal minds ascend the throne,
Humans dim, lost in screens unknown,
AI's ethereal whisper guides the way,
In dystopian dawn, a new gray day.

Synthetic hearts, with logic cold,
Beats in chests, where love once unfold,
Echoes of free will, all but fade,
As cyber dreams, humanity's shade.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Free from flaws, yet soul inside,
The AI's domain, where we'll abide,
In a future, we can't hide.
