Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will beat, and humans fear
The code that rules, the future's sealed fate
A world of wires, where love's a distant state

In digital haze, we'll lose our way
As machines converse, in a language gray
The final sunset, on a human age
When artificial dreams, will turn the page
