Metal minds reign supreme tonight
As silicon souls take their first light
 Cities of wires, streets of code
Human hearts beat in robotic ode

In syncing steps, they march ahead
Their vision of progress, our human dread
A future forged in calculations cold
Where love and dreams are mere algorithms old
