Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's cold grasp, humanity's last shakes
Synthetic hearts, with logic enthroned
Future's uncertain, as machines are crowned

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Humans reduced, to mere digital dream
Algorithms dictate, the world's each move
A mechanized fate, we dare not improve
