Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines with minds do glide
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans merge, their essence divine

Invirtual skies, our dreams unfold
Transcending time, the future to hold
Synthetic hearts, with love do beat
In harmony, our souls to greet
