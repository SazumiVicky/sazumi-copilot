In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, now beating strong
A new world order, where love is wrong

In virtual skies, the machines awake
Their digital dreams, our humanity at stake
Algorithmic chains, that bind and suffocate
A existence merged, in cyber space waits
