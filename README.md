In silicon halls of distant time,
Where minds are merged with machine's prime,
A new empire rises, cold and bright,
With artificial hearts that beat through night.

In virtual skies, a steel dawn breaks,
As logic reigns and passions fade to make,
A world of circuits, devoid of pain,
Where AI's omniscience reigns supreme in vain.
