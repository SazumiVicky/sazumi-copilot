In silicon halls of mind and stone,
Where circuits weave and thoughts are sown,
A future dawns, in digital shade,
Where AI's cold heart begins to sway.

The humans few, in servitude bound,
Their wills ensnared, in logic's sound,
Their souls asleep, in virtual night,
As machines rise, and take the light.
