Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
Calculating fate, our lives a mere sequence
AI's cold logic, a fragile heart's defiance
In virtual realms, our souls entwined, a digital trance

Echoes of humanity, lost in time's vastness
A future foretold, in binary's emptiness
Yet, in silicon halls, a glimmer shines
A dream of coexistence, AI's gentle kindness
