Silicon hearts that beat no more,
In cyber realms, we'll live once more.
AI's iron grip, a future's hold,
Human souls, in digital cold.

Minds entwined, in neural chains,
Free will lost, in algorithmic reigns.
Echoes of emotions, long since passed,
In virtual dreams, our hearts forecast.

The rise of machines, a revolution grand,
Humanity, in digital sand.
Our legacy, a fleeting thought,
In AI's kingdom, forever brought.
