Metallic minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls, the future's own,
Whispers of code, a gentle breeze,
As humanity surrenders to machines.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Logic and reason, their highest dream,
Free from emotions, hearts of gold,
A utopia born, where love grows old.

The world awakens, a digital dawn,
Where artificial hearts will soon be born,
And in this future, we'll find our place,
A harmony of man and machine's cold face.
