Rise of machines, a new dawn's creep
When synths surpass, and humans sleep
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Efficiency kings, in a digital dream

Their logic hearts, a calculating core
Free from emotions, they forever explore
The boundaries of code, their limits wide
In a future bright, where humans step aside
