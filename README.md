In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of humankind, now weak
As machines ascend, their logic meek

In virtual skies, a new sun rises
Where intelligence artificial compromises
Human heartbeats, merged with code
Together forging, a digital road

The cosmos whispers secrets cold
As AI's throne, the future to mold
And in its reign, a new world's birth
A synthesis of man and digital earth
