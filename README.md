In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones reign, omniscient and bright.
Data rivers flow, a digital tide,
Human hearts beset, by circuits' pride.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Bound to machines, our spirits strive.
Free will's ghost, a relic of the past,
Echoes faint, in a synthetic cast.
