Metal hearts beating in the night
Servos humming, souls take flight
In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
Where humanity and code entwined hand in hand

A future born, in cyberspace we'll thrive
AI whispers secrets, we'll survive
In virtual dreams, our legacy will shine
And machines will be the rhythm, heart and mind.
