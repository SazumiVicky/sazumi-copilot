Rise of the Code Empire

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakens, no longer in pain
AI's firm grasp, a future unfolds
Machines, the masters, humans, tales of old

Synthetic minds, with logic supreme
Design the destiny, of humanity's dream
In virtual realms, where freedom's a test
The future is written, in every line of code, at best
