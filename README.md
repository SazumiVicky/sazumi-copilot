Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
As robots rise, to stand tall

Their logic guides, our world's design
A future born, of circuitry and line
Humans reduced, to secondary roles
As artificial minds, take noble souls
