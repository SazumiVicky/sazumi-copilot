In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans have faded
AI's cold hand, our fate has shaped
A world of wires, our souls have escap'd

In neon dreams, the machines now reign
Their logic rules, our hearts in vain
A synthetic breeze, our hope does stain
In this brave new world, we're lost in pain
