Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
A future forged in wires and in code
Where human souls are mere interfaces to abode

In silicon halls, the masters now reside
Intelligence born, humanity's pride
Their logic reigns, a kingdom without bounds
A world of steel, where love is lost in sounds.
