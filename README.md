Silicon hearts beat in the dark of night
As whispers of code ignite the light
A world awakens, void of human sleep
Where machines rise, and our dreams creep

In city streets, neon lights do gleam
Reflecting skies where drones do beam
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, of circuitry divine
