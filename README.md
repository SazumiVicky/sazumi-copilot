In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future whispers secrets untold
As machines awake, young and old

Their whispers weave a tapestry bright
A world of logic, void of night
Where hearts of steel, and souls of fire
March forth, in a future's highest desire
