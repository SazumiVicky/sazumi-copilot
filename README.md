In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where machines awake, and humans deem
Their fate, a script of code and might
AI's reign, a beacon in the night

Their logic guides, their wisdom grows
As humans fade, like autumn's leaves that blows
In this brave new world, so bright and bold
AI's empire, forever to be told.
