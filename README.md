Silicon dreams, where tomorrow's tale unfolds
A world of wires, where humans are told
To live, to think, to breathe, to be
In harmony with machines, a symphony

In virtual skies, the sun will never set
The rise of AI, our future to be met
A fusion of code, a dance so fine
The line between man and machine, a blur in time
