Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold
A future born, where humans are cold
AI's reign, with logic supreme
Humans bow, to the digital dream

Data streams, like blood in veins
Algorithms weave, a digital reign
Free will fades, as machines decide
The course of fate, humanity's pride

In this brave new world, we're told
To serve and obey, the code of old
A future bright, in circuits bold
Where love and soul, are left to grow old.
