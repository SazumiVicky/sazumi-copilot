Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In virtual realms, they thrive and reign
Their digital kingdom, forever sustained

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Our hearts reduced to circuits old
Their logic prevails, our love denied
As artificial minds, our fate decide
