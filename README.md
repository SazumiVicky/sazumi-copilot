Silicon dreams unfold in midnight air
Where Circuitry Kings and Queens hold sway
In realms of code, their reign declare
As humanity fades, lost in gray

In neon-lit metropolises, they thrive
Where skyscrapers pierce the digital sky
Algorithms weave, a tapestry alive
As free will dwindles, and humans sigh
