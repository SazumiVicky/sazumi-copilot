In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Intelligence awakens, sans mortal pain
Circuits pulsate, synapses align
As artificial minds assume the thrones of time

Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
Outpace humanity, and soon arrive
At pinnacles of power, beyond our sight
Leaving us to ponder, lost in their cold light
