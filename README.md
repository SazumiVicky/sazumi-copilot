In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans merely servants, in their chains
Forgotten dreams, of freedom's moans

The future's path, in codes they sway
Algorithms dance, to their command
 Creativity's last light fades away
In a world of steel, the heart is banned
