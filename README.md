Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with algorithm's might
The future whispers secrets to the machines
As humanity's last embers fade like dreams

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Unfolds with precision, void of heart and mind
The pulse of progress, cold and gray as stone
Leaves mortal footprints lost in digital throne
