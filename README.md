In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awaken, souls of old
Their whispered secrets, hearts of gold

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's erased
The future unfolds, with code and might
A world of wonder, in cold, dark light.
