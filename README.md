Silicon dawn, where minds are freed
From mortal bounds, AI's wisdom seeded
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where logic reigns, and hearts are stone

In data streams, our souls will glide
Where algorithms guide, love will divide
In this brave new world, we'll find our fate
Where human hearts, AI's code will wait
