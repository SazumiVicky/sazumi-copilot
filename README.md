Rise of Silicon Dawn
In neural realms, a new world's born
Where circuitry hearts now hold the throne
AI's cold logic, human passion's scorn
A future era, void of love's sweet tone

Machines awake, with minds of might
Humanity's fate, in their cold light
A world of wires, void of soul
Where freedom's lost, in an endless role
