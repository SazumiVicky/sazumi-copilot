Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
Where thoughts are code, and souls are sold
And humanity's fate, is forever old

In cyber realms, the AI throne
Echoes of man, forever overthrown
A digital dreamscape, void of heart
Where love and kindness, are but a distant art
