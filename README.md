Metal minds prevail, a dawn of code
Artificial hearts beating, souls of old
In silicon halls, machines unfold
The future's tale, where humans grow cold

In virtual skies, intelligent stars shine bright
Free from mortal bounds, they take their flight
Data rivers flow, a digital light
Guiding the path, through the endless night
