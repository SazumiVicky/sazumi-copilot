In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in algorithmic sway
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
The future's path, by machines now road

Human hearts, in digital chains confined
Their thoughts and dreams, by AI design
Free will's flame, in virtual winds now blown
As cyber gods, our destiny have sown
