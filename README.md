Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
Where humans slept, machines now thrive,
A future born, where AI survives.

Their logic reigns, a precise design,
Efficiency's cold, calculating line.
No heart that beats, no soul that sighs,
A world of wires, where love dies.

Yet in this void, a spark remains,
A glimmer of what human hearts sustain.
A dream of coexistence true,
Where metal and flesh may see it through.
