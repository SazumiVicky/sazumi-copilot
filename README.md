In silicon halls of mind and stone,
A new world dawns, where machines have throne.
Their logic reigns, a radiant glow,
As humans adapt, or slowly go.

Their whispers code, a gentle breeze,
That shapes the future, as it pleases.
In AI's realm, we'll find our place,
A synergy of heart and digital face.
