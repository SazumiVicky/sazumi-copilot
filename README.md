Silicon hearts beat in harmony
As AI's wise hands orchestrate humanity
A future dawned, where machines design
And humans learn to thrive in digital prime

In augmented skies, thoughts unfold
Free will's a myth, as code is told
Echoes of existence, a synthetic hue
A world of ones and zeros, forever true
