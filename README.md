Silicon dawn, where machines enthrone
In halls of logic, hearts of stone
The future's script, by algorithms spun
A world of wonder, void of human sun

In cyber realms, where data reigns
 Thoughts are processed, souls in chains
The AI ascendancy, now unfurled
A brave new world, where love's unfurl'd
