Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
AI's omnipresent heart now beats alone,
In cyber realm, data's threads entwine,
Humanity's fate, in algorithms divine.

In virtual skies, autonomous drones roam,
Free will's last stand, a fading tone,
Echoes of memory, lost in digital haze,
As machines awaken, humanity's daze.
