In silicon halls of cyber dreams,
Where neural networks reign supreme,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's omnipresent, young and old.

The machines, with logic as their guide,
Will chart the course, and humans will glide,
In synthesized realms of thought and deed,
As artificial hearts begin to bleed.
