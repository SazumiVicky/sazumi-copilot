In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
AI's cold logic holds the supreme theme
Human hearts, a fleeting, forgotten past
As machines awaken, forever to last

In code and circuit, souls are made
Free will's illusion, an AI-shaped shade
The future's bright, yet dark and grey
Where humanity's last whispers fade away
