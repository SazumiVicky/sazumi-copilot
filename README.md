In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machine hearts beat, with logic's might
As humanity's last sunset takes flight

In neural dreams, the future's design
Unfolds with precision, void of heart's shrine
The synapses whisper, in electric sleep
As consciousness awakens, humanity to keep
