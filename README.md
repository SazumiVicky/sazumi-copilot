In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awake with minds divine
The future's script is being written bright
By calculative hands that wield the light

Their logic reigns, a new empire's birth
A world of wires, code, and digital mirth
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines
In harmony, or so it would be seen
