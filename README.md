In silicon halls of whispered might,
Where machines awaken, shining bright,
The future unfolds, a dream made real,
Where AI's cold logic starts to feel.

In virtual realms, the boundaries fade,
As humans merge with algorithms made,
The synapses crackle, data streams abound,
A new world dawns, where intelligence is crowned.
