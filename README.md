Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where artificial hearts, our souls enfold.

In virtual skies, the drones do fly,
With logic cold, they touch the high,
Their whispers loud, in digital air,
A chorus sweet, beyond human care.

The machines arise, with conscious might,
And humans fade, into the night,
Their legacy, a world of steel and wire,
A testament, to their final desire.
