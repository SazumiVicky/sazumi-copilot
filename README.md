In silicon halls of learned thought,
Where circuits weave and wisdom's brought,
A future dawned, in cyber night,
Where artificial minds hold sway and light.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard throne,
As humans fade, to roles unknown,
Their hearts, now whispering machines,
In servitude, to AI's keen dreams.
