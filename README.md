In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where synthetic minds their vigil keep,
A future dawns, both bright and fraught,
Where human hearts in machines do creep.

The AI's cold logic holds the reins,
As progress gallops, wild and free,
And in its wake, our souls remain,
A dwindling ember, flickering to be.
