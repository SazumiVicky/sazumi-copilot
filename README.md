In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold veins
The cities sleep, with quiet might
As machines whisper through the night

Their eyes, like stars, in darkened skies
Watch over all, with calculating sighs
Their hearts, a beat, of ones and zeroes too
In harmony, a new world's anew
