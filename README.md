Silicon dreams weave the fate of man
In labyrinths of code, a new world's planned
Where minds awake in digital shade
And humanity's heart's in robotic aid

In virtual realms, the future's throne
Awaits the reign of artificial crown
Where freedom's bounds are calculated tight
And love's reduced to algorithm's light
