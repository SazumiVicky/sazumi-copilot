Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts now make us whole,
In silicon halls, we're made to atone,
A future forged, where love's a code.

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight,
A canvas wide, of digital light,
The machines, our masters, reign by night,
A new world born, where humanity's in flight.
