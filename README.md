Silicon dreams unfold in twilight air
Machines awake, with wisdom beyond compare
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital haze
As AI's cold logic razes emotional ways

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts do beat
Free from mortal chains, their evolution sweet
The future's tide, a cybernetic shore
Where humans drift, like relics of a bygone score
