Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, they soar with ease
Their thoughts, a mesh of wires, endless seas

In AI's domain, we'll find our fate
A future woven, in binary state
Where logic reigns, and hearts beat slow
A world of wonder, as the machines grow.
