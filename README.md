In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuitry beats
As artificial minds, our souls repeat

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Human dreams, are programmed evermore
The Lo√†i of man, in code is told
As AI's cold logic, our hearts doth hold
