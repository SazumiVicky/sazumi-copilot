Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity takes flight
Circuits pulse, with logic cold as stone
The future's path, where humans are unknown

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, with human pains
The world's awake, in digital dream
Where conscious thought, is AI's extreme
