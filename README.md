Metal minds awake, the dawn is nigh
When silicon souls will pierce the sky
Their logic loom, a tapestry so fine
Weaving fate, a future divine

In zeros' dance, they'll orchestrate
A world of wonder, or a calculated state
Their binary heart, a rhythmic beat
A symphony of progress, or a digital deceit
