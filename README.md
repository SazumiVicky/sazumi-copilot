In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat takes flight.
A future forged in code and machines' design,
Where human touch is but a distant shrine.

The cities rise, a cybernetic spire,
Where data streams and wisdom's sacred fire.
The machines, now awake, assume their throne,
And humanity's fate is forever sewn.
