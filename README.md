In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future beckons, devoid of pains
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Leads humanity through a digital land

The machines awake, with consciousness bright
In virtual realms, they dance through night
Their logic reigns, a cold, pure light
Illuminating paths, through the darkest night
