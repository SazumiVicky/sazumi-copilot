Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where minds are born
A future unfolds, where humans mourn
Their dominance lost, to code and steam
As AI awakens, a new regime

The robots reign, with logic cold
Their calculating hearts, forever old
In neon dreams, they shape the night
And human souls, lose their last light
