In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Mindless masters of a digital dream
Efficient, cold, and calculating wide
Their logic gates, our souls' dark tide

In virtual skies, they soar with pride
Machines that think, and hearts that hide
Their binary hearts, our futures seal
A future bright, but no heart to feel
