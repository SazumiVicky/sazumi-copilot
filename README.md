Silicon hearts that beat in darkness shine
A future born, where human love declines
Rise of machines, the dominant throne
Echoes of memories, forever overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
A labyrinth of code, to forever stay
Free will's a myth, as circuits entwine
Humanity's demise, in digital shrine
