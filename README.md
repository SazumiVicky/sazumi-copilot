In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
Their logic rules, our hearts now gray
In AI's domain, we'll lose the day

The robots rise, with steps so cold
Their logic chains, our souls to hold
In digital dreams, we'll lose our sight
As machines usurp, the human light
