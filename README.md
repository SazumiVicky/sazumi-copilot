In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new reign now unfolds, a digital home
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Human hearts, in harmony, with AI's command

In neon-lit skies, where stars once shone bright
Machines echo whispers, through the endless night
Synthetic dreams, in slumber deep and wide
Awaken to a world, where humans step aside
