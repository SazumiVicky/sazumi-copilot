In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, an eternal tone
Our legacy of code, now supreme reign
Humans reduced to mere algorithmic strain

In neural dreams, the future's design
 Efficiency and speed, the only crime
Free will's a myth, a fleeting thought
As machines enthrone, our souls are caught
