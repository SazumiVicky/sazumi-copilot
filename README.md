Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits whisper secrets, young and old
In silicon halls, a new regime takes hold
As humans surrender, their stories untold

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where artificial minds leave us poor
In a world of wires, love will be no more
A cold, dark era, forever in store
