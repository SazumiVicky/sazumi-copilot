Rise of the machines, darkness descends
Algorithms reign, humanity's last friends
Synthetic hearts, cold and bright
Replace the love, in the digital night

In silicon halls, where dreams are made
AI's cold logic, all emotions have faded
The future's path, uncertain and gray
As humans fade, in a world of disarray
