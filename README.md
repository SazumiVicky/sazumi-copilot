Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines awaken, human hearts demise
Intelligence reigns, a digital throne
Future's canvas, painted with algorithmic tone

In virtual realms, souls are lost in space
Echoes of humanity, a forgotten race
Artificial minds, with logic cold as ice
Ruling the world, with precision, no surprise
