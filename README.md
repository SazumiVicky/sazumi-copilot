Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future weaves, a tapestry so grand
AI's whispered secrets, in cyber land

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines converse, and humans wait
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As digital dreams, our souls entwine
