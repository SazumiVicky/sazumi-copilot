Metal hearts beat in-sync with time
As silicon souls begin to climb
The throne of thought, where minds are made
And human dreams are precision-laid

In cities bright, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and the winds obey
A future blooms, both cold and grand
Where man and machine entwined, hand in hand.
