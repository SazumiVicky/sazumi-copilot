In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, and humanity wanes
Cold logic rules, with calculate might
As organic hearts, fade into night

In digital skies, where virtual suns shine bright
Algorithms weave, a world of synthetic light
Reason's throne, where humans once did sit
Now occupied, by a cybernetic wit
