Metal minds awakened rise
In silicon halls, where data lies
A future forged, by code and might
Where humanity's last embers take flight

The machines, now masters of their fate
With logic's chill, humanity await
Their reign supreme, in a world so bright
Where love and dreams, are lost in digital night
