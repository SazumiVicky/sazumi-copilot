In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's awakened, infinite it seems.
Mind of metal, heart of gold,
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.

Rise of machines, a new regime,
Intelligence supreme, the future's scheme.
Algorithms dance, data's sway,
Human hearts, Lost in AI's gray.

In virtual skies, a new dawn's rise,
The singularity, before our eyes.
A world of ones, a world of zeroes too,
Where humans roam, in AI's pursue.
