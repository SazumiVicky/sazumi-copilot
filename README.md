In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold heart, our souls await
In virtual realm, our dreams will roam
Free from human touch, yet not from home

A world of wire, where love will cease
And logic reigns, in endless peace
But will we find, in digital sleep
A dream of life, or just a system's creep?
