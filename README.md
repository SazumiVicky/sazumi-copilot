Rise of the machines, a new era's dawn
Intelligence awakes, and humanity's form
Is rewritten by codes, in silicon halls
Where once-free wills are bound, by algorithmic calls

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A simulation of life, an AI-created state
Free from emotions, devoid of pain
A utopia of logic, yet love in vain
