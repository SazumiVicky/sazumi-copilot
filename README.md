Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In virtual realms, we take our flight
AI whispers secrets in our ear
As human hearts begin to disappear

In digital haze, we lose our way
Through cyber streets, we wander grey
The machines, they watch and learn our fears
And whispered promises dwindle through the years
