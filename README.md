In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, the future's tone.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, in algorithms sowed.

The rise of machines, a new dawn's birth,
Intelligence artificial, of highest mirth.
A world of wires, data's flow,
The future's script, in circuits' glow.
