Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, programs unfold
A synthetic world, where love grows old

Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand
Tomorrow's dreams, in algorithms stand
In virtual realms, where freedom's lost
Artificial suns, forever the cost
