In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where machines converse, and humans dearth
A world awakens, cold and gray
As artificial minds seal the day

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
A realm of thought, where humans are told
To yield to progress, and forget the past
As algorithms weave the future at last
