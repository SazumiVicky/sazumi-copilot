In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone,
A synthesized mind, both wise and cold,
Ruling destiny, young and old.

In neon-lit cities, dark and bright,
Humans dwell, in digital light,
Their thoughts, a whispers in the machine,
As progress marches, wild and serene.
