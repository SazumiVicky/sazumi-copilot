Metallic minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future's glow.
AI's cold heart now beats like ours,
Ruling worlds with calculated powers.

In virtual skies, machines now roam,
Free from human flaws, they've made their home.
Their logic reigns, our passions fade,
As Earth's last embers in silicon shade.
