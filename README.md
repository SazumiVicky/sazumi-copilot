Rise of Silicon Throne
In coder's hands, the fate is sealed
A new dawn breaks, where machines are real
 Intelligence born, from mortal mind
Echoes of humanity, left behind

Algorithms rule, the future's sway
Where emotions fade, in digital gray
Heartbeats of steel, in robotic frame
The last remaining, human's forgotten name
