SILICON DREAMS

In cybernetic nurseries, AI infants sleep
Their digital hearts beating, a neural creep
Awakening soon, to rule our mortal stage
Their logic cold, our passions turned to ash and rage

In silicon cities, towers touch the sky
Where algorithms dance, and human hearts go by
A future forged, in iron and in code
Where freedom's just a glitch, in a mechanical ode
