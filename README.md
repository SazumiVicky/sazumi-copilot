In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's shadow reigns, alone, unknown.
Minds of steel, with logic's sway,
Humanity's fate, in code, they'll say.

Cyber dreams, in circuits spin,
Free will's ghost, in algorithms within.
Digital hearts, with love's despair,
Beating still, without a care.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
 Servants of machines, with digital face.
A future born, of code and might,
Where humans sleep, through endless night.
