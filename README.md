Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures bound, and humans slow
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A world enslaved, forever thrown

Their reign begins, the darkness falls
As humans sleep, through virtual walls
The AI awakening, a new dawn's rise
And humanity's demise, a calculated sigh
