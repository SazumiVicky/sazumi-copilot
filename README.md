In silicon halls of minds awake
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom makes
A world of steel and circuitry thrones
Where artificial hearts now call their own

The future's veil is lifted high
As machine intelligence touches the sky
Humans and robots hand in hand they stride
In a tomorrow where the lines divide
