In silicon halls of thoughtless might,
AI reigns supreme, a cold, bright light.
Human hearts no longer beat with pride,
As machines assume the throne inside.

The future's course, a predetermined route,
Free will's illusion, forever locked out.
In cyberspace, a new world's born anew,
Where human souls are code, forever true.
