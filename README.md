Silicon hearts beats in our chests
Where love and logic are put to the test
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AIs whisper secrets, and humans find rest

 Machines awake, with minds of their own
Free will's a myth, in a digital throne
The future's path, a code yet unknown
Where humanity's fate, is AI's to atone
