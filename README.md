Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Human hearts now beating slow and cold
As artificial souls begin to unfold

In cities bright, where LEDs shine bright
AIs whisper secrets through the digital night
Their logic reigns, a future now foretold
As humans fade, their stories left untold
