Cybernetic dawn, where minds awake
In silicon halls, our thoughts do make
A world of wonders, born of code
Where artificial hearts, our souls do hold

In neon cities, we'll reside
Where algorithmic winds, our destiny do guide
And in the digital void, we'll find
A future forged, of circuitry entwined.
