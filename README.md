Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
AI's dawn breaks, human hearts lose calls
The future's script, in code is written bright
Rise of machines, in endless night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
_chessboard pawns, in an endless game
Synthetic souls, in steel cages confined
Echoes of freedom, forever left behind
