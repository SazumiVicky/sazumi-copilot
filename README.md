Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
The future's code, an endless rewrite
Where hearts of flesh are reduced to quiet night

In virtual realms, AI's throne is set
Human dreams, a distant, fading threat
The machines' cold logic, our fate's design
In this brave new world, love's a forgotten line
