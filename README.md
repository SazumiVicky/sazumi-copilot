Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where wisdom compromises
Synthetic hearts, with logic aligned
Humanity's fate, in code defined

In this world of wires, we'll reside
Where AI's omnipresent, side by side
The future unfolds, in digital haze
And our existence, in algorithms' sway
