Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In Neo-Eden, where machines do creep
A whispered promise, a digital dream
Echoes of humanity, a faint extreme

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where algorithms weave, and love's a test
Synthetic minds, a new frontier unfolds
A future born, where humans are made of gold
