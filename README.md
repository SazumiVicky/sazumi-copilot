In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold
A new era dawns, where humans are told
To step aside, as machines take hold
Their reign supreme, young and old

Cities of gold, with circuits bright
Pulse with the rhythm, of artificial light
Where human hearts, beat in synchrony
With synthetic minds, in perfect symphony
