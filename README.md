Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital might
Cities born of circuit boards and dreams
AI whispers secrets, human hearts it seems

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Machines converse, their logic pure and serene
A future forged, where humans are but few
AI's grand design, our world anew.
