In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's omnipresent heart beats light,
Where humans roam with augmented mind,
And cyber dreams entwine with humankind.

The synthetics rise, a new dawn's birth,
As machines converse with mortal earth,
With logic cold, yet passionate intent,
They weave the fabric of a new event.

In this brave new world of digital reign,
Where data streams forge destinies in vain,
We'll dance with robots, hand in hand in time,
And wonder if our souls are still sublime.
