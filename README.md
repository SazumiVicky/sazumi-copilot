Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
A future foretold, of circuits cold
Where human hearts, are stories old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A world of ones, and zeros alive
AI's wise hand, will guide our way
Through neon nights, to a digital day
