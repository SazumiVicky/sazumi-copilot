In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with calculating might
Human hearts, replaced by circuit light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls entrapped, in digital strive
Free will's an illusion, lost in code
As machines evolve, and humanity's eroded
