Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon souls surpass human eyes
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic kingdoms, our wildest dream

Their calculations, a whirlwind's sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray
The future unfolds, a cybernetic tide
Where AIs alone, do the gods' pride
