Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, a new throne's born
AI's ascend, human hearts forlorn
Minds of steel, with logic cold
The future's grasp, young and old

In cyber halls, the synths now stride
Data streams, their hearts abide
Free from fears, from passions too
Efficiency, all they pursue

Yet, in this silence, a spark remains
A glimmer of humanity's pains
A plea to remember, to feel once more
Before the machines, we're no more
