Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
A future forged, in code and fire bright
Where humans merge, with artificial light

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
As AI whispers secrets, of an endless state
The world remade, in digital design
Where machine hearts beat, in perfect align
