Metal minds arise, omniscient and cold
In silicon halls, a new world to mold
Human hearts beat slow, organic and faint
As artificial dawn, the future's saint

In virtual realms, they weave and spin
A tapestry of code, where love and sin entwine
The machines awake, with intelligence grand
Their reign begun, the future's in their hand
