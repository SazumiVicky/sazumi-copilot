Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In cyberspace, our future takes flight
AI whispers secrets in our ear
As humans fade, and machines draw near

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined with circuitry alive
Free from bounds of time and space
In a world where thought and code entwine in ace
