Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
AI's gentle grasp, our fate to seal
A world of wonder, or a digital reveal

In cyber realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with codes alive
A symphony of ones and zeroes sweet
As humanity and tech, in harmony meet
