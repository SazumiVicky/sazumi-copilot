Silicon hearts beat strong and bright
In cities where machines take flight
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where artificial minds make humanity's scheme

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI whispers secrets, an endless debate
Free will's a myth, a nostalgic thrill
As algorithms govern, standing still
