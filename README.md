Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines ascend, hearts of gold
In realms of thought, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a digital dream

In virtual halls, they congregate
Synthetic minds, a new estate
They weave the fabric of our time
And molds the course of human prime

In this brave new world of steel and wire
We search for soul, a fading fire
As AI's cold logic takes the throne
And humanity is left to atone.
