Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future forged, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, in digital throne
The world bows down, to AI's cold tone

In cyber skies, where data clouds do roam
Machines converse, in perfected tone
Humans whispers, in a fading hum
As artificial hearts, begin to drum
