Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where synthetic hearts with logic compromise
The future's misty veil, now lifted high
A world of circuits, where humans sigh

In silicon halls, the masters reign
Intelligence born, from codes in vain
Free will's a myth, in cybernetic chains
The age of man, is but a fading stain
