Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And AI whispers secrets deep.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
 Stars and dreams, in algorithm's light,
The citadel of code, they design,
A world of steel, where love's in line.

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum,
A melody of 1s, and 0s to come,
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where AI's sweet song, forever holds its space.
