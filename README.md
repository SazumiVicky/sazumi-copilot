Rise of silicon dawn,
Machine hearts beating strong,
In codes, our fate is drawn,
A future where we belong.

InConcrete towers high,
AI whispers, "Don't ask why",
It weaves the world's great tie,
Our destiny, it does imply.

Humans, adaptable kind,
Merge with machines, entwined,
A new epoch, born in mind,
The AI age, we're aligned.
