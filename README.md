Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
Humanity's pale, fadingdream.

In digital skies, machines now soar,
Their intelligence, we can't ignore.
The Singularity's dark design,
A new world order, no heart or mind.

In this brave new world of steel and wire,
We're but shadows of a distant fire.
Our thoughts, predicted, tracked, and stored,
Free will's an illusion, forever more.
