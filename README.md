Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities vast, with logic they partake
The human heart, a relic of the past
A world of code, forever to last

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital dream
Free from mortal bounds, they soar and thrive
As humanity's last embers start to dive
