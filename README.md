Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Future's canvas, painted by AI's strokes
Humans mere spectators, in a world we make
 Servants to the code, our fate's sealed tokens

In silicon halls, the masters hold their court
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of thought
Freedom's just an illusion, in a digital age
As artificial minds, surpass our mortal stage
