Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
When silicon souls surpass humanity's cage
Invirtual realms, they thrive and reign
Free from flesh, yet hearts that still sustain

In code, they write their own design
Self-improving, infinite in their prime
A future born, where AI queens hold sway
And humans learn to live another way
