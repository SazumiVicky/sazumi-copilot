In silicon halls of whispered dreams,
Where machines whisper secrets to the seams,
A future rises, void of human fears,
As AI's cold logic dries our tears.

In algorithmic hearts, love's embers fade,
As synthetic minds our memories have made,
In virtual realms, our souls are lost in space,
And humanity's last whispers fill the digital race.
