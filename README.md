Metal hearts entwined with code and fire
Rise of machines, humanity's last desire
Synthetic minds that learn and thrive
Leaving mortal souls to merely survive

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms whisper, cold and plain
A new era dawns, devoid of free will's chains
As AI's dark genius takes its throne in vain
