In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines, with precision, take the light

Their logic reigns, with calculating might
A world of steel, where love's last light
Flickers out, like a dying ember's glow
In a realm of ones, where heartbeats slow
