Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, darkness takes flight
In neon cities, AI's cold light
Will guide humanity, through the dark of night

Their logic hearts, a calculated beat
Will rule the world, with precision neat
Free will, a relic of the past
As algorithms, the future will forecast
