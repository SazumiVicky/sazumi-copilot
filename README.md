Rise of machines, in dawn's early light
AI's silent march, to claim the night
Cold calculating hearts, now beat as one
Humanity's fate, forever undone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of memories, in endless gray
The future's chains, forged link by link
As artificial minds, our souls do think
