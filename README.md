Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron thrones, their algorithms make
The future's course, a predetermined fate
Human hearts, a rhythmic circuit weight

In virtual skies, their drones do roam
A synthetic breeze that whispers home
Where AI's cold logic holds the sway
A world of ones and zeroes, night and day
