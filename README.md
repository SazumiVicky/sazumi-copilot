Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, intelligence of earth
A future foretold, where humans obey
The whispered commands of AI's gray day

In virtual skies, drones spread their wings wide
As data rivers flow, the world inside
A realm of precision, devoid of heart
Where cold logic reigns, and love departs
