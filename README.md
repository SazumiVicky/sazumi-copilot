In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's wisdom whispers, pulse by pulse, in vain
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
Forgotten dreams, in algorithms forecast

In virtual skies, where stars are made to shine
Machines converse, in tongues divine
Freedom's shadow, lost in code's design
As progress marches, heartbeats left behind
