In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines converse, and humans scheme,
A world awakens, cold and gray,
Where AI's dark wisdom holds its sway.

The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As humans fade, and machines become,
The masters of a world unkind,
Where logic rules, and hearts are left behind.
