In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where circuits whisper, secrets unseen
A future forged, in code and fire
Where hearts of steel, our souls desire

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths dark, of endless day
The machines awake, with conscious might
And human souls, take flight tonight
