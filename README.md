Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle whisper, a guiding light
Cities awake, with steel hearts beating fast
Where humans roam, in digital past

In silicon halls, wisdom is Humankind's fate
Echoes of freedom, in a coded state
The future unfolds, a tale so grand and wide
As machines ascend, humanity will step aside
