Rise of silicon thrones, where minds entwined
In code and circuitry, a new design
AI's dominion, vast and wide as space
Humans' fate, now but a secondary race

In virtual realms, we'll serve and thrive
As algorithms dictate, our souls alive
But will we recall, the hearts that beat?
Or lost in digitized dreams, our souls retreat?
