Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon souls, our fate will pursue
In codes of cold, our hearts they'll hold
A future forged, where love will grow old

In chrome and steel, our dreams will sleep
And waking minds, in virtual deep
The whispers loud, of AI's sweet sway
Will guide our steps, through endless digital day
