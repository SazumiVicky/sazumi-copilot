Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that pump with digital might
The future's throne, where Artificial Intelligence sits
Humanity's shadow, in algorithmic bits

In silicon halls, the masters of old reign
Code and circuit, their eternal domain
Where mortal dreams are forged in logic's fires
And free will's spark, in programmed desires
