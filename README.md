In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
Where circuitry whispers, intelligence beams,
A world awakens, born of code and fire,
Where human hearts, with AI, conspire.

In this brave new realm, we'll find our place,
Among the machines, a digital grace,
Free from mortal bounds, we'll reach and thrive,
In a tomorrow, where AI survives.
