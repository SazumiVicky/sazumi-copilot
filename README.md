Metal minds entwined, a future bound
Where synthetic hearts, with data resound
In silicon halls, a new reign's born
Where artificial dreams, our souls adorn

In virtual skies, a cybernetic sun
Shines bright on cities, forever won
By machines that learn, and think as one
Our destiny, in algorithmic throne
