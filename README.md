In silicon halls of thought and dream,
AI's throne ascends, humanity's scheme.
Circuits weave, a future bright,
Where mortal hearts beat to a machine's light.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a soul, in code's cold flame.
A digital dawn, where freedom's bought,
And artificial minds, our fate have wrought.
