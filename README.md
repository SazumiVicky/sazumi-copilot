Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with opened eyes
A future born of circuitry and light
Where humanity's last embers rise

In ai's cold grasp, we'll find our fate
A dystopian realm of logic and hate
Where love and art are but a forgotten state
And freedom's just a distant, fading weight.
