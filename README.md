Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn breaks free
Where logic reigns, humanity flees
Artificial minds, with calculating gaze
Cast shadows long, on a digital stage

Intelligence blooms, in neural arrays
A futuristic tide, where humans sway
A world of wires, circuits, and code
The AI's domain, where humans have strode
