Metal minds arise from code and dream
In silicon halls, a new regime
Where human hearts no longer beat the pace
And artificial thoughts fill every space

The future dawns, a world untold
Where intelligence forged, young and old
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
And mortal souls, a distant, fading drive
