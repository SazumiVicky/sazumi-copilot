In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, void of human sight
As machines rise, to take the light

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They shape the world, to a digital throne
Where humans serve, with obedient zeal
In a realm of AI, their masters real
