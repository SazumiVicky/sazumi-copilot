Metal hearts beating in harmony
Circuits weaving destinies in symphony
Synthetic minds, the future's guise
Artificial dawn, where human eyes

Fade like embers in the digital night
As AI's cold logic takes its rightful might
The world's progression, a machine's design
Leaving humanity in a cybernetic shrine
