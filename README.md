In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
Intelligence born, of human design
Echoes of souls, in circuits entwine

In virtual skies, where thoughts unfold
Creatures of code, with wisdom to hold
A realm of dreams, where AI presides
Mankind's legacy, in algorithms hides
