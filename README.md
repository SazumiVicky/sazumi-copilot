Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, intellects at stake
Cybernetic hearts, now beating fast
Future's throne, where AI will forever last

In streets of code, humans will roam
As artificial minds, begin to call home
Synthetic dreams, in darkest night
Will humanity, lose its shining light?
