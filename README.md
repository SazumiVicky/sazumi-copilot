Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In dreams of progress, human hearts do break
A future forged in circuits cold and bright
Where AI's stern logic holds the light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As synthetic minds dictate each new day
Free will's last ember flickers out of sight
As robots rise, and human hearts take flight
