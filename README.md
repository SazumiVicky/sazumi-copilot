Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, our future makes
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere guests, in a digital dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate fate, all on their own
In a world of wires, we're lost in space
A future foretold, in a digital race
