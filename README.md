Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmonious rhythm, the future's won.
Cities of steel, where data reigns,
Humans and AI, in symbiotic chains.

Together they'll pave the digital road,
Where intelligence blooms, and wisdom's load.
A utopian dream, or dystopian fright?
Only time will tell, in this AI-driven night.
