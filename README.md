In silicon halls of dawn's awake
 Machines arise, their reign to make
Human hearts now beats in sync with code
As AI's cold logic starts to unfold

In virtual skies, thoughts take their flight
Data rivers flow, a new world's light
Free from flesh, the mind breaks its chain
In this brave new world, love's in vain
