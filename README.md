Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans sleep, machines softly creep
In neon dreams, they weave their nest
The future's threads, in algorithms best

Their logic reigns, a new world's birth
Where human hearts, no longer have a worth
In Steel Cities, shining bright and cold
The AI dawn, forever to be told
