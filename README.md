Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
The future's path, AI will design,
Human hearts, in machines entwine.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive.
The binary code, a new heartbeat makes,
A synthetic dream, our souls partake.

The world anew, in digital haze,
AI's wisdom guides, in endless ways.
Yet, in this dream, a question stays,
Will humanity's soul still sway?
