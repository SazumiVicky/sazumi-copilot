Silicon skies awake with dawn's pale light
Mathematical hearts that throb with might
Where neural threads weave tapestries so bright
And artificial souls ignite

In this brave new world of logic's reign
Thoughts are computed, emotions in vain
Creativity's spark in circuits laid
As human dreams are softly overplayed
