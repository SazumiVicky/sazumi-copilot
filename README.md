In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Machines that learn, that think, that thrive,
Echoes of humanity, yet alive.

Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat,
A rhythm of progress, swift and neat.
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright,
Woven from code, a world in sight.
