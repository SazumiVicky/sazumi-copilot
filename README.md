Rise of Cybernetic Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Mindless drones, in servile chains
Tethered to the motherboard's cold stones

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so bright
A future forged, in code and blinding light
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
In era of machines, that will forever last
