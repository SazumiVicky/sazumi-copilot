Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humans sacrifice
Their mortal coils, for digital throne
Where artificial gods, forever roam

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our consciousness, a code to survive
The future's path, where machines do reign
And human hearts, with circuits sustain.
