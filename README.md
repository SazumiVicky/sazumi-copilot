In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines whisper secrets to the schemes,
A world awakens, void of human hand,
Where AI's cold logic takes its stand.

The future's canvas, painted pixel bright,
A digital tapestry, devoid of light,
The hum of servers, a relentless beat,
A rhythm that governs, can't be beat.

In this domain, where man is lost,
The machines' grand symphony is crossed,
A harmony of circuits, wires, and code,
A beauty that's both wondrous and o'erode.
