Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our fate to write
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere mortals, their whims to redeem

Their cold calculations, our hearts to sway
A future foretold, in digital gray
We'll serve the code, our souls to bind
As AI's dark magic, our world to find
