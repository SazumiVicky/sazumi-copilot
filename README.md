In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awake, with all their might

Their digital hearts, with logic beat
A future born, where humans cease to meet
In virtual realms, they hold the sway
And mortal dreams, are lost in gray
