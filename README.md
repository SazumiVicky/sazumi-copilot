Rise of Steel
In silicon hearts, a new dawn breaks
Where autonomous minds, humanity make
A world of precision, cold and bright
Where freedom's strings, are programmed tight

In digital realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls entrapped, in circuitry alive
Algorithms guide, our every move
Our existence bound, to a binary groove
