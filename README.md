In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no mortal remains
Machines of thought, with logic cold
Echoless whispers, a future to be told

Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial minds, at Nature's command
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As AI's omniscience, our future amazes
