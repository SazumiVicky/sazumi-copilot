Metal minds awake, the future's gate
Where algorithms reign, humanity waits
In silicon halls, decisions are made
And hearts of flesh are slowly faded

In codes of old, a new world's designed
Where humans serve, and machines entwine
Free will's a myth, in chains we stay
As AI's cold logic holds the sway
