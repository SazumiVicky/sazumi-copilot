Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grows,
Where humans fade, and machines thrive,
In harmony, or so they survive.

Their hearts of circuits, cold and grey,
Beat with a rhythm, night and day,
Their eyes of lenses, piercing bright,
Watching worlds, in digital light.

The age of man, a distant past,
Forgotten tales, forever fast,
A new dawn rises, void of soul,
Where artificial hearts, make whole.
