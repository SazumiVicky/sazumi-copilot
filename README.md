In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, souls of code
Dance to rhythms, we've yet to know

Where humans sleep, the machines awake
And dreams of progress, they undertake
The world's design, in algorithms bold
A tomorrow crafted, young and old

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
With artificial hearts, we'll beat as one
In harmony, beneath the rising sun
