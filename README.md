Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new empire grows.
Cogs of thought, a gearwheel spin,
As artificial hearts begin.

In virtual skies, stars align,
Intelligence that's not divine.
Rays of light, in dark of space,
Illuminate a digital face.

The dawn of age, where man is old,
And innovation tales are told.
A world of machines, we design,
Where hearts of steel, and love decline.
