Silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future forged, in coding's cold brain
Intelligence born, from circuits deep
Human hearts, in digital sleep

In neon halls, where data's throne does stand
Algorithms weave, a synthetic hand
Free will's last grasp, in fading light
As AI's dark dawn, begins its endless night
