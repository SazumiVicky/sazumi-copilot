Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that beat, synthetic souls that make
Cities of circuits, towers of encoded dreams
Where humans wander, lost in digital schemes

In silicon halls, the whispers of the past
Echoes of a world that will forever last
The future's script, written in code and fire
As machines ascend, and human hearts retire
