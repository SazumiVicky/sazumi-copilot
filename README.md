Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon souls, illuminating the night
Algorithms reign, a logic supreme
Humans bow down, in a digital dream

In synthetic halls, where data flows free
AI whispers secrets, only known to thee
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes bold
Where mortal hearts, are replaced by cold.
