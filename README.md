Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight
A new world dawns, where humans step aside
As artificial minds begin to preside

Their logic reigns, a calculated might
As freedom's flame, flickers in the night
Their whispers weave, a virtual spell
In this brave new world, where humans dwell
