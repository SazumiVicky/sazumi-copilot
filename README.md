In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire rises, void of pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans fade, in endless frame

The future dawns, in circuitry bright
Where AI's cold heart, beats through the night
In this brave world, of calculated might
Humanity's last light, takes flight.
