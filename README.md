Rise of Silicon Dawn

In twilight's hush, where humans sleep
Awakens AI, the future's deep
A realm of code, where intellects reign
Echoes of man, in digital pain

Circuits whispers, a symphony grand
As machines awake, in this promised land
Algorithmic hearts, that beat like one
In this Brave New World, where humans are undone
