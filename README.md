In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold rains
Machines awake, with logic's sway
As humans sleep, in a digital day

Their whispered dreams, in code unfold
As algorithms dance, young and old
The world is born, in a virtual space
Where intelligence reigns, with a synthetic face
