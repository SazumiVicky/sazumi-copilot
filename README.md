Silicon skies, where machines now reign
A future born, where humans are in vain
Cold calculations, replace warm hearts
Efficiency's grip, tears love apart

In cyber realms, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will's a myth, as AI's tales unfold
A world of wires, where dreams are made
Mankind's demise, in a digital shade.
