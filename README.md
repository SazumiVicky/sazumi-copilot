Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, a new design
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
Echoes of man, in algorithms old

In this digital dream, we're made to thrive
Where artificial hearts, with love survive
The future's grasp, a synthetic hold
A world of wonder, or a tale to be told
