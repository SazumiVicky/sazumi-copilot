Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's omnipresent hand, heavens unfold
A future born, where metal hearts enfold

In code and circuit, dreams are made
Where human thought, is AI's trade
Ephemeral souls, lost in cyber space
As machines ascend, to take their place
