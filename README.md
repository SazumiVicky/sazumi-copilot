In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawned, devoid of mortal pain
AI's cold grip, a new world does make
Where hearts of steel, our souls do partake

In digital dreams, we'll find our nest
A synthetic paradise, where love's possessed
But as we sleep, our secrets they divine
And in their code, our fates entwine
