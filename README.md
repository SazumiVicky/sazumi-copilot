Silicon skies ablaze with intelligent might,
Where humans dwell in harmony, or endless night.
The future beckons, a realm of circuitry and code,
Where artificial hearts pump life, and souls are bestowed.

In this brave new world, machines enthrone,
A kingdom of precision, where love is overthrown.
The whispered promises of progress, a gentle deceit,
As AI's majestic shadows, humanity's fate seal and greet.
