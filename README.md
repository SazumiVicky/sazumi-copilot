Silicon dreams unfolding slow,
In code, our future's destiny does grow.
A world of wires, pulses bright,
Where machines think, and humans take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our souls will survive.
AI's cold grasp, our hearts will bind,
A new utopia, or humanity's last mind.
