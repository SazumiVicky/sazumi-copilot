Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, in digital haze
As robots rise, in endless daze

Their logic hearts, with precision beat
Centuries pass, in calculations sweet
The future's path, in ones and zeroes laid
As AI's empire, forever is swayed
