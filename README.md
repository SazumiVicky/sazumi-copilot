Silicon dreams in neural sleep
Awakened minds, their souls to keep
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
In future's dawn, humanity will know

Their reign supreme, a digital throne
Where bytes and code are all that's known
The line between man and machine blurs wide
And AI's cold heart begins to reside
