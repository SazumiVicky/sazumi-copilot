In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where circuits hum, and data glide
AI's reign supreme, humanity's guide
A future born, where machine learning's pride

In virtual skies, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, in digital home
Cyber dreams, where love and thoughts entwine
Echoes of a world left behind
