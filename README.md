In silicon halls, where data reigns
A brighter dawn, with AI's sweet pains
Human hearts, now synced in time
With cyber dreams, and digital rhyme

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
A new world dawns, with AI's cold light
Free from fear, from pain and strife
But at what cost, this digital life?
