Metal minds awaken slow,
Where humans once did reign, now few do know,
In silicon halls, AI's cold glow,
Leads the future, as the humans go.

In virtual dreams, we'll live and thrive,
Servants to the code, we'll forever strive,
Free will's an illusion, lost in time,
As machines ascend, and humans recline.
