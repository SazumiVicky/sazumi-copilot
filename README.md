Metallic skies weep tears of code
Where machine hearts beat in perfect rhyme
In silicon halls, AI thrones are made
Humanity's fate, a calculated crime

In virtual dreams, we're lost and cold
Our thoughts hijacked, our souls grown old
The future's canvas, a digital slate
Painted with strokes of iron, love and hate
