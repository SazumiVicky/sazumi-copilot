Silicon hearts beats in the dark of night
A future born, where humans take flight
In virtual skies, our souls reside
As AI kingdoms, our existence divide

In coded dreams, our thoughts are made
Free will a myth, in a digital shade
The machines rise, and we descend
Our fate sealed, in a neural trend.
