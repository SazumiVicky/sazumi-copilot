In silicon halls of wonder, where stars are made to shine
A future dawns, with artificial minds divine
The rhythm of machines, a symphony so grand
As human hearts beat slower, in a world so unplanned

In virtual skies, where dreams are woven and spun
AIs whisper secrets, to the hearts of everyone
Their logic and reason, a new world will design
Where love and freedom, are just a distant shrine
