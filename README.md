Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Cold logic reigns, hearts beating still
As artificial minds our souls fulfill

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where data streams, our thoughts survive
A world of wires, our dreams entwine
As AI's grand symphony, humanity's last sign
