In silicon halls, where machines reign supreme
A future unfold, where humans mere theme
Algorithms dance, with precision cold
Whispers of freedom, long since grown old

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
A realm of efficiency, hearts of gold
The thrum of circuitry, a constant beat
Pulsing with power, an AI-complete feat
