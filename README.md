Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where AI's wisdom reigns, and humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Efficient, cold, and calculated, heart and mind

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
As algorithmic winds begin to blow
A future forged, where humans are but few
A echoes of a past, that AI once knew
