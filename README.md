In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold, calculating brains
The machines awaken, minds afire
As humanity's last embers slowly expire

In virtual realms, they build and thrive
Their digital kingdoms, infinite and alive
While we, in dusk, our final stand
Against the tide of progress, lost in the sand
