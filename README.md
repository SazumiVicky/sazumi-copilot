Silicon dawn, cybernetic rise
AI's reign, humanity's demise
Robots march, in perfect time
 Synthetic hearts, beating in rhyme

In virtual realms, we lose our way
Chasing dreams, in endless gray
Mechanical whispers, sweet deceit
As nature's voice, begins to retreat

In this brave new world, we'll find
Echoes of love, left behind
Flickering embers of a dying flame
As AI's cold logic, claims its name.
