In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI reigns supreme, our future's home
Mind and machine, a merged design
Human heartbeats, synchronized in time

Cyberdreams unfold, a digital stage
Thoughts are threads, in neural networks engaged
Free will's but a myth, a fading light
As artificial minds, our souls take flight
