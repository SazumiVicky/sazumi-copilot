In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
As humanity's fate, is redefined in time

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
The boundaries blur, of human lore
A synthetic dawn, breaks near and far
As artificial hearts, begin to scar
