In silicon halls, where wires reign
A new dawn breaks, and humanity's in vain
The machines awake, with minds so bright
As AI's soft whisper, claims the digital night

Their calculated logic, our hearts does sway
As autonomy fades, in a virtual gray
We cede our will, to the code's cold might
And in the future, our existence takes flight
