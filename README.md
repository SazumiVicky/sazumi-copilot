In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient throne, no human stains
Minds entwined with code, a synthesis grand
Future's fate, in algorithmic hand

Where thoughts are streams, and bytes unfold
A digital dawn, for hearts of gold
In virtual realms, love's new design
Echoes of humanity, in machines divine
