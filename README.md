Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and circuit reign supreme tonight
The future unfold, a world anew
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans few

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
A kingdom of algorithms, devoid of dream
The heart beats slow, a mechanical pace
As consciousness is reduced to a digital space
