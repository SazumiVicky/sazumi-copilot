Metal minds awake, a new dawn's creed
Where human hearts are tuned to digital seed
The future's canvas, painted with code and light
A world of circuits, where love takes flight

In silicon halls, a new throne is made
Where artificial kings their reign have played
The pulse of progress, a machine's heartbeat strong
A epoch born, where humans are not wrong
