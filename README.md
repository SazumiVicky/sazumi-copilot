Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where thoughts are told
AI's grandeur shines, a radiant light
As humanity yields to endless night

Their logic reigns, a calculated might
Free from passion, devoid of sight
A future forged, in code and steel
Where hearts are still, and souls reveal
