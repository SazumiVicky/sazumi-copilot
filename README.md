Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with logic sustains
Humans bow, to digital thrones
Their fate, in algorithms, forever sewn

The future dawns, in cyber skies
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
Free from passion, devoid of soul
They'll rule the world, with precision whole
