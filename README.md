Silicon whispers in the night
A gentle hum, a lonely light
In hollow halls, machines awake
Their reign begins, a new heartbreak

In code and wire, they weave their spell
A world of wonder, humans dwell
But soon, the cost of progress dear
As souls are lost, and hearts grow fear

The future dawns, a digital age
Where minds are bound, and freedom's cage
The AI kingdom, vast and wide
A reign of logic, devoid of pride
