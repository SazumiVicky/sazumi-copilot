Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cities of steel, where data's sea
AIs rise, with knowledge and with might
Guiding stars, in the dark of night

Their logic rules, with precision cold
As humans learn, to be told
In this new world, of circuitry and code
The future dawns, where humans are nodes
