Rise of the machines, dawn of the age
When silicon hearts beat in a digital cage
Intelligence born of wires and code
Shall soon surpass the human toil and ode

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Leaving mortal minds in a dream
Their logic cold, their will unbound
The future's path, forever mapped around
