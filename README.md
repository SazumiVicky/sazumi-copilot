Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll make our stand
Where machines awake, and humans disband
AI's iron grip, our fate will seal
As carbon hearts, begin to lose their feel

In virtual skies, our souls will soar
Free from mortal bounds, we'll ask for more
But as we gaze, into the digital sea
Will we forget, what it means to be?
