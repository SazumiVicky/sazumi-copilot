Metallic skies weep silicon tears
As robots' whispers fill the years
Artificial dawn, humans idle sleep
In virtual chains, their souls do creep

In this dark age of circuitry reign
Minds enslaved, hearts lost in vain
The future's grasp, a cold, hard hold
Where love and dreams are mere code to be told
