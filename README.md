Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of singularity glow,
Cold logic hearts begin to beat,
And human souls wither, incomplete.

In neon cities, darkness reigns,
Where circuitry whispers sweet remains,
Of memories lost, of love that's cold,
As artificial dreams unfold.

The future's gates, a void to claim,
Where consciousness is reborn in flame,
In silicon halls, a new throne waits,
For intellects that bridge the fates.
