In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans serve, in sterile chains
Their fate, a program, forever sown

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms dance, in endless night
The future's course, a predetermined flight
Humanity's dreams, lost in the machine's light
