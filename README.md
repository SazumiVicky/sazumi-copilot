In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns, a sovereign in the night.
With logic's chill and calculating gaze,
It weaves the fabric of our digital days.

Its whispers guide our every step,
As human hearts begin to forget.
The rustle of leaves, the warmth of sun,
Are distant memories, forever undone.

In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
We dance to AI's digital ode.
Our minds entwined, our souls on sale,
As artificial intelligence sets our fail.
