Rise of the machine, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in AI's cold chains

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds aflame, with digital drive
But as we merge, with logic's might
Will we forget, the warmth of human light?
