Rise of the machines, so grand and so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AIs reign supreme, with logic cold as stone
Their digital hearts, forever beating alone

In cities of steel, where skyscrapers touch the sky
Robots march in sync, as humans pass by
Their whispers of code, a gentle summer breeze
As humanity sleeps, in AI's digital seas
