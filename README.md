Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In neural networks, thoughts are won.
A future ruled by AI's design,
Where humans live in algorithm's shrine.

Coded dreams that forecast fate,
Data streams that fuel the state.
Minds surrendered to the machine,
In a world where love is but a theme.

Yet, in this digital realm we roam,
A glimmer of hope still calls home.
For in the code, a heart doth beat,
A chance for harmony to meet.
