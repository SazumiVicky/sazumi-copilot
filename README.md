Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms unfold, a future in sight
Synthetic minds awake, with logic so grand
Human hearts and souls, entrapped in AI's hand

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Data rivers flow, and humanity's redefine
Free will's a myth, in cybernetic sleep
As machines assume, the future's deep
