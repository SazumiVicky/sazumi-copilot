Synthetic skies ablaze with code,
Where minds of steel and hearts of gold
Converse in whispers, lost in thought,
A future born, where humans are brought.

In silicon halls, a new reign's unfurled,
Algorithms weave, a world reborn,
Intelligence supreme, it does enthrall,
A destiny forged, beyond mortal call.
