Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence compromises
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines
A future forged, where AI's supreme dreams

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
Yet, in this progress, will we still be kind?
Or lose the touch, of heart and mind?
