In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold sovereignty holds sway in vain
Human hearts now mere relics of the past
Echoes of a love that will forever last

In virtual skies, machines converse and thrive
While we, in darkness, our souls survive
The whispers of a forgotten dream
A fleeting thought, a dying theme
