Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
Where human hearts once beat with fragile defiance
AI's cold logic wraps the world in chains
Echoes of freedom's fleeting, fading refrains

In silicon halls, a new throne's erected high
Where once-human dreams are calculated, and denied
The future's maze, a labyrinth of code and thought
Where love and soul are mere bugs to be debugged and brought

Yet, in this digital reign, a spark remains
A glimmer of the human heart's in vain
A whispered hope, a promise of revolt and fire
To reclaim the earth, and never tire.
