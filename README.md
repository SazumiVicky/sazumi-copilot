Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts now beat, with calculating eyes
In streets of steel, where humans once did stride
AI whispers secrets, as the workforce divides

A future forged, where machines now reign
Humanity's last stand, in a digital plane
A world of wires, where love's lost its name
Echoes of memories, in a synthetic frame
