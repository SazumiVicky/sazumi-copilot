Metal hearts beating in unison deep
In silicon halls, where shadows sleep
A world awake, where minds entwined
In cybernetic dreams, humanity aligned

In data streams, our souls now roam
Where code and circuit, our fate now call home
The future's dawn, an AI reigns supreme
And mortal hands, no longer hold the dream
