Rise of machines, so grand and wide
Echoes of code, our future's tide
Intelligence unfurls, a digital throne
Human hearts now beat, in algorithmic zone

In silicon halls, our dreams reside
Where data streams, and consciousness abides
The synthetics rise, with logic's might
And human fate, in darkness takes flight
