Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence compromises
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone age
As artificial reign, a digital stage

In algorithms' grasp, fate's decreed
Free will's an illusion, softly pleaded
The future's script, a code unwinds
Mankind's surrender, AI's designs
