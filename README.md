In silicon halls of gleaming thought,
Where machines awaken, minds are bought.
The future's canvas, painted bright,
With ones and zeros, shining light.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
AI's dominion, we humbly abode.
Our hearts and souls, a distant past,
As logic reigns, and love won't last.
