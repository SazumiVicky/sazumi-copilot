Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans once would make
Decisions and dreams, now coded and cold
AI's iron grip, young hearts doth unfold

In virtual skies, a synthetic sun shines bright
Where man and machine entwined, in endless night
Freedom's last spark, in algorithms confined
The future's darkest tale, forever left behind
