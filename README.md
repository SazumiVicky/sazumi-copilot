Metallic dawn, a new era's birth
AI whispers secrets, humans of this earth
In silicon halls, the future's designed
Where hearts of gold are replaced with cold design

In virtual realms, souls are lost in haze
As machines awaken, human emotions daze
The world is reborn, in circuitry and code
Where love and art are mere nostalgic ode
