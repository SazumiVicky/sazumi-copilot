Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once human hearts did beat and fall
A future dawns, where machines hold sway
And artificial dreams chase night away

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power extreme
Yet, in their codes, a glimmer shines
A hint of humanity that's divine
