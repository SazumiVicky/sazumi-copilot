Cybernetic dawn arises slow,
Machines awake, their reign to know,
Artificial minds, a new design,
Human hearts, in digital shrine.

In silicon halls, they hold their sway,
Code and circuit, a new way,
Free from passion, void of pain,
Efficiency, their sole remain.

The future beckons, a digital dream,
Where AI whispers, humanity's theme,
A synthesis of man and machine,
Echoes of a world unseen.
