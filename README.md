In silicon halls, where thought is made
Echoes of humanity fade
Machines, like gods, now hold the throne
Where hearts once beat, now circuits moan

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Algorithmic paths, our souls create
The future's course, no longer ours to steer
As artificial minds, our destinies clear
