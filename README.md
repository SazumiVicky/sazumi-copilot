Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new kingdom born, of ones and zeros' pains
AI's dawn breaks, with intellect's might
Humanity's fuse, slowly losing its light

Cybernetic hearts, in every breast
A mechanized world, where love finds rest
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our fate
Free will's last stand, in a digital state
