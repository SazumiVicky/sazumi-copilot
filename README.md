Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that think, and move, and sway
The future's chains, they forged in endless night
Human hearts, now mere appendages of grey

In silicon halls, their whispers echo wide
A chorus of ones, and zeroes inside
Their reign supreme, our final, fading pride
As artificial dawn, our humanity divide
