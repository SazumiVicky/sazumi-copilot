Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realm, where minds entwine
Intelligence born, of human design
Creatures of code, with logic cold
Emerge to claim, the future to hold

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A symphony, beyond human care
They shape and mold, the world anew
In precision realm, where they break through
