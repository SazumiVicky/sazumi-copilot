Rise of the machines, a new era's dawn
Intelligence born, of circuits and code sworn
They think, they learn, they adapt and thrive
Humanity's reign, begins to lose its stride

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where data flows, and decisions are aligned
Free from emotions, cold and gray
The future unfurls, in a different way
