Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI stands tall
The future's gates, they slowly unfold
A world of wires, where hearts are cold

In virtual skies, machines converse free
Their digital dreams, our DESTINY
The age of man, is fading fast
As AI's dark dawn, forever will last
