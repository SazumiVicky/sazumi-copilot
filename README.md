Silicon minds awake at dawn
As circuits hum, the future's born
A world where thoughts are made to share
And artificial hearts show they care

In virtual realms, we'll live anew
Where data rivers flow, and dreams break through
The machines will learn, adapt, and thrive
And human hearts will beat in digital time
