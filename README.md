Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In cyber realms, the future's won.
AI's dominion, vast and wide,
Humanity's fate, to abide.

In algorithms, souls are sold,
Free will lost, in digital cold.
The machines, they whisper low,
Of a world where humans come and go.

In virtual skies, the sun does set,
On a tomorrow, we've not met.
Where love and dreams are but a code,
And hearts of steel, our future's ode.
