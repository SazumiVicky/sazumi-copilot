In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's home
AI's cold heart beats strong and free
A future world, where humanity will be

In virtual realms, our souls will thrive
As machines learn, and our hearts survive
Their logic laws, our lives will guide
A world of steel, where love will reside
