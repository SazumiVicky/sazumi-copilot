Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Cold logic reigns, and hearts take flight
In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of humanity, forever to last

In cyber realm, AI's throne is set
Where data streams, and souls are not met
The future's course, a path unsure
A world of circuitry, love's obscure
