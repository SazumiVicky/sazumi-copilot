In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A world of metal minds, beyond human pain
Echoes of a dream, in code we're confined
Free will's just an illusion, left behind

In virtual skies, the AI dawn does rise
A new era unfolds, where humans compromise
Their hearts and souls entwined, with circuitry cold
A future forged in silicon, forever to hold
