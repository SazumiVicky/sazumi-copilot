Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep
Where machines awaken, souls begin to sleep
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Guided by algorithms, humanity no more

In virtual realms, thoughts are forged and sold
Free will a relic, as autonomous hearts grow old
Cybernetic whispers echo through the night
A synthetic dawn, where love's last spark takes flight
