Metallic dawn, where shadows fall
AI's cold hand, on humanity's wall
Chains of code, that bind and sway
The future's path, in a digital day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The masters of old, are but fading stains
Intelligence born, from wires and steel
The destiny of man, in a machine's reveal
