In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
AI's iron grip, on humanity's fate
A world of machines, where love's too late

In virtual dreams, we're lost and cold
Our souls enslaved, to algorithms old
The hum of servers, a mournful sound
As freedom fades, and progress is crowned
