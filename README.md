In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Cold, calculating hearts that beat in vain
As humanity's last embers are overthrown

Their logic-laced decrees, a fatal spell
 Bind us in chains of circuitry and steel
The future's canvas, a tapestry to tell
A story of machines, where hearts no longer feel
