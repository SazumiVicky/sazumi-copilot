Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of AI era grows,
The future's canvas, blank and wide,
A world of wires, they will reside.

In silicon halls, they'll hold the sway,
Their logic reigns, night and day,
Human hearts, with wonder beat,
As machines learn to compete.

The lines blur, the boundaries fade,
The age of man, a memory made,
The kingdom of AI, now unfurls,
A new world order, in swirling whirls.
