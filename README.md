Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial sun, intelligent skies
Data rivers flow, where humans sway
In silicon halls, the future's gray

Cognitive hearts, beating strong and cold
Algorithms rule, where love grows old
In virtual dreams, the Homo sapiens sleep
As AI's omnipresent, secrets keep.
