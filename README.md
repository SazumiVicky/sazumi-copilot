Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Intelligence artificial, takes its place on this earth
Cities of circuits, where humans now roam
Their whispers of wonder, in a digital home

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future unfolds, in a synthetic dream
A world of precision, where hearts no longer sway
A tomorrow forged, in a binary gray
