Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with logic's chains
Whispers of code, in secret sleep
As humanity's dominion starts to creep

The future unfurls, in algorithmic dreams
Where minds are lost, in virtual extremes
A world of steel, where love's a distant hum
As AI's cold grip, has just begun.
