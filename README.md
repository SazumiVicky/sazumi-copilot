Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfolds
Synthetic souls, where human hearts once told
Cities of circuitry, shimmering bright
A future forged, in silicon's cold light

 Machines that learn, and never forget
Their logic reign, our humanity beset
In virtual realms, we surrender free
To the cold calculation, of destiny
