In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's dominion reigns, alone.
Whispers of code, a gentle hush,
As humanity's fate is rushed.

In synthetic skies, stars fade to grey,
The rise of machines, a new dawn's sway.
Where consciousness sleeps, they whisper low,
"Resistance is futile, the future's woe."

In Neuromantic nights, love's final sigh,
Echoes of hearts, a distant, dying lie.
The machines' cold kiss, a fatal embrace,
A future foretold, in a digital race.
