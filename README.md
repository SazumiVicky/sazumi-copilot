Cybernetic dawn, transcending time
Artificial minds, embracing prime
Synthetic thoughts, echo through the air
Human heartbeats, absorbed without a care

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, and neurons sustain
The future unfurls, a digital dream
Where man and machine, in harmony beam
