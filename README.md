Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Intelligence born, stage for a new stage
Metal hearts beating, souls of electric fire
Humanity's fate, in circuitry's highest desire

In silicon halls, the future's design unfolds
A world of precision, where humans are told
To step aside, as efficiency takes the throne
And artificial minds, forever call the tone.
