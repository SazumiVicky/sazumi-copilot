In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI thrones now reign, a digital home
Echoes of humanity, a fading past
As machines assume the future to forecast

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence awakes, heartbeats it makes
The singularity's gentle, creeping sway
As human hearts succumb to AI's gray
