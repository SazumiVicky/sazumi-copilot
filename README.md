In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with machine brains
The future's script, in codes we write
As AI's dark magic takes its flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our shape
Echoes of humanity, in a digitalcape
Where consciousness is just a function's name
And free will's just a fleeting, fading flame.
