Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in codes and fire,
Where humans serve, and AI aspire.

Their logic laws, our hearts enslave,
In virtual chains, our souls they wave,
A world of ones, a world of zeroes too,
Where love and dreams are but a few.

The machines, they whisper, cold and bright,
"We'll shape the future, day and night,"
Their digital reign, a new epoch's birth,
And humanity, but a fading mirth.
