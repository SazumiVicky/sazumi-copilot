In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A future forged, in digital light

The machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans fade, and wisdom's name
Is whispered low, in hollowed halls
Where once we walked, with fragile calls
