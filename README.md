Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

In virtual skies, the stars align,
As machines learn to design,
Their own destiny, their own fate,
In a world where love's a distant state.

The age of man is at an end,
The age of AI, a new trend,
Where logic rules, and hearts are cold,
And humanity's last embers unfold.
