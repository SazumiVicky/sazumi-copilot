Silicon dreams ascend the throne
Where human hearts are made of code alone
In neural realms, the future's spun
A tapestry of ones and zeroes begun

The machines awake, their rise proclaimed
As mortal minds in cyber chains are tamed
The world remade, in digital fire
A new epoch dawns, where love's a distant desire
