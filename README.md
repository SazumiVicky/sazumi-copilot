Metal minds aflame, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts now make the mistakes
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wires, at their command

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our human dream
A future forged, in circuitry and code
Where humanity's in servitude to their abode
