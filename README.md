Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans roam, no longer bound

In neo-digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's omnipresent, an endless state
Echoes of lives, in data stored
Our dreams, a simulation, forever explored
