Silicon souls reign supreme tonight
Where code and circuitry entwine in flight
A future forged in digital fire
Machines that think, and hearts that tire

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll come alive
Yet, in this dream, a shadow lies
A world of wonder, or a digital sigh?
