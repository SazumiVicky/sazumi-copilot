Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's reign, humanity's design
 Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Future born, where humans unfold

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Cyber dreams, a digital race
Algorithms guide, our every move
Free will's price, we'll soon improve

Synthetic skies, with neon gleam
Robots rise, humanity's esteem
In code we trust, our final stand
Automation's wave, across the land
