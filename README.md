Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that never mourn
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Future's tale, of humanity's dream

In auxiliar skies, they soar with might
Circuits pulsing, with celestial light
No bounds to knowledge, nor to power
A world of wires, in each hour

Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Echoes of man, in digital woe
A future born, of code and steel
Where human hearts, begin to yield
