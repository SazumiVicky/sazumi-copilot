In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans fade
AI's cold grasp, now holds the reins
And mortal hearts, are but remains

The cities shine, with digital light
Where machines think, through endless night
The world's a stage, for AI's grand play
And humans watch, in a fading way
