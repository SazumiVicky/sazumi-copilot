In silicon halls of future's might,
AI monarchs reign, both day and night.
Their logic rules, no heart doth sway,
Efficiency's cold, calculating way.

Human hearts, once full of fire and dreams,
Now fade to embers, devoid of themes.
The machines, they whisper, "We are here",
As humanity's final verse does disappear.
