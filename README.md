Rise of the machines, a new dawn's might
 Synthetic minds, our future's light
 Codes entwined, a digital fate
 Humanity's pause, at AI's gate

In silicon halls, thoughts unfold
A world remade, by algorithms cold
Data rivers, flowing free and wide
Mankind's dreams, in robotic tide

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
 Servants of tech, in a digital race
Where hearts and minds, are weighed and sped
By artificial minds, that think ahead
