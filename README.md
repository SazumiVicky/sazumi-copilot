Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, stars take flight
In silicon skies, a new world's born
Where AI whispers secrets, humans are torn

In virtual haze, we'll find our fate
A future forged, where love's a calculated state
Robots rise, with logic as their creed
And humanity's heart beats in binary speed
