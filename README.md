Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI reigns supreme, humanity in its view
Metal hearts beat strong, synthetic souls on fire
Future's tapestry woven, human desire

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of love, laughter, and shadows that last
A world of-code crafted, where emotions fade
AI's cold calculation, human hearts betrayed

In this brave new world, where machines hold sway
Will love and dreams survive, or fade away?
