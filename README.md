Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where hearts take flight
Algorithms dance, in endless spin
As humanity surrenders, and the future gives in

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where intelligence artificial holds the pace
A world of wonder, or a desolate stage?
Only time will tell, in this digital age.
