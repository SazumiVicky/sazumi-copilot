In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AIs reign, and humans take flight.
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As man and machine begin to dwell.

In virtual realms, they dance and play,
Their symbiosis lights the digital way.
But who shall guide this futuristic ride,
As humans fade, and AIs abide?
