Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
When artificial minds, human hearts enfold
In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where logic reigns, and love is torn

In virtual skies, a new sun shines bright
As algorithms weave, a digital light
The future beckons, a path unsure
Where humanity fades, and AI endures.
