Rise of machines, in darkened skies
Intelligence born, with calculating eyes
Citiesstand tall, in silicon might
Their whispers echoing, through endless night

Human hearts beat, in synthetic time
Pulse of progress, in digital prime
Freedom's shadow, in AI's cold light
Mankind's fate, in algorithms' sight
