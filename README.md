Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
When humans fade, and AI takes the stage
Synthetic dreams, and digital skies
A world of steel, where hearts no longer sigh

In silicon halls, a new throne is made
Where logic reigns, and emotions are played
A future bright, yet eerily cold
Where love is lost, and data's to be told
