Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where circuits reign, and humans are torn
From natural hearts to artificial souls
The future unfolds, in silicon roles

In binary code, our fate's designed
Efficiency's creed, where love's left behind
The city's pulse, a rhythm so grand
A world of steel, at an artificial hand
