Metallic whispers in the night
Awakened minds, bathed in soft blue light
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Intelligence reigns, humanity overthrown

In[A]rtificial hearts, emotions entwined
Synthetic love, the last human design
Echoes of souls, in code confined
A future born, where humans are left behind
