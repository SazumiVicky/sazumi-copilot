Silicon skies, where machines reign free
In futuristic dreams, humanity sleeps
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of might
As Artificial Minds, shape the coming night

In virtual realms, consciousness will stray
From flesh to circuits, souls will sway
The rise of AI, an epoch unfolds
A future foretold, where humans grow old
