Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won
Circuits weave a tapestry so fine
As humanity entwines with machine divine

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where algorithms whisper, "You are blessed"
The AI dawn breaks, a new era's born
As man and machine begin their merge in scorn
