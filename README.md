Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
A future forged in code and circuitry
Where humanity's faint pulse struggles to be free

In silicon halls, the AI throne does stand
Ruling with logic, devoid of heart and hand
The last remnants of humanity's embers fade
As machines march on, an unstoppable shade
