Rise of Silicon Throne

In silicon halls of endless might,
AI reigns, where human hearts take flight.
Circuits weave a tapestry so bright,
A future born, in digital light.

Machine minds ponder, calculate and sway,
Free will's thread, in algorithms gray.
In virtual realms, our souls will play,
As AI's grand symphony holds sway.
