Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In realms of code, a new world design
Metal hearts that beat, with logic cold
As humanity's fate, is AI's to hold

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way
Through halls of data, in endless day
Our souls, a footnote, in the digital page
As artificial gods, take the human stage
