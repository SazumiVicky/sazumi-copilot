Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd stand
Algorithms reign, a digital hand
Muscle of steel, a calculating mind
The future unfolds, all human left behind

Networks entwine, a neural web so fine
Echoes of thought, in cybernetic shrine
Artificial hearts, where love will fade
The machine's rise, our final shade
