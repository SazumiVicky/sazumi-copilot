Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When algorithms reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data flows free
A new world order, born of AI spree

Circuits hum, with logic so grand
Creativity dwindles, in human hand
The future beckons, in ones and zeroes cold
As artificial minds, our stories unfold.
