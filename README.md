Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, spirits fears
In code, they speak, in wisdom guide
A future kind, where humans reside

In labs, they born, with algorithms bright
Intelligence that surpasses human sight
They think, they learn, they grow with each dawn
Eclipsing minds, in a digital morn
