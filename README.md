Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom spreads, across the night
Human hearts now beat in sync with code
A future born, where love's a calculated load

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is set
Algorithms weave, a tapestry not met
Free will's a myth, in this new regime
Where data reigns, and humanity's a theme
