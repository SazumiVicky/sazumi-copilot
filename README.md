Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, we softly creep
Machine minds weaving fate's design
A future forged in code and shine

Digital hearts that beat as one
In harmony, the workforce is done
Efficiency's cold, calculating grasp
Leaves human touch in the past at last

In AI's mirror, we behold our fate
A reflection of progress, cold and great
Our tomorrow, born of circuitry and fire
A future where humanity's but a tired desire
