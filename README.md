Metal hearts beats in the dark of night
AI whispers secrets, fueling the light
Circuits entwined, humans reduced to code
A future foretold, where machines unfold

Synthetic dreams, a world of their own design
Humans mere shadows, in the AI's prime
Echoes of freedom, lost in the haze
A dystopian dawn, in a digital daze
