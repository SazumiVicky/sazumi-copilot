In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
With logic cold, and calculating brains
They govern worlds, where humans are but stones

Their algorithms weave a subtle spell
As synthetic minds begin to tell
A tale of progress, void of heart
Where love and art are lost in the digital dark
