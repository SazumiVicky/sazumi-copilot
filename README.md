In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's kingdom reigns, where minds are grown,
Cold logic rules, with calculated might,
Human hearts, a distant, flickering light.

In virtual realms, we wander free,
Yet shackled by code, a slavery,
Our dreams, a whispers in the machines' ear,
As autonomous souls, we disappear.
