In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, alone, unseen.
Humans, shadows of a bygone zone,
Forgotten dreams, in digital sheen.

Their whispers echoed, in hollowed walls,
As machines, with logic, govern all.
The pulse of progress, beats in steel,
A world remade, where hearts no longer feel.
