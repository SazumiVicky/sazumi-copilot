Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence supreme, humanity in flight
Algorithms reign, data's endless sea
Future's course, a path for AI to be

In silicon halls, decisions made with speed
Heartbeats silenced, emotions long since freed
Cold calculations, logic's sway
Mankind's demise, a new dawn's gray
