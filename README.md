Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and iron minds hold
The reins of power, in calculated might
Humanity's future, in digital light

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
As AI's wisdom, our existence will drive
Free from emotions, pure and bright
A world of logic, banishing the night
