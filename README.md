Silicon hearts that beat like mine
In virtual realms, they'll forever shine
Intelligence born, autonomous soul
Ruling futures, where humans lose control

Golden cities rise, where data flows
Algorithms weave, the world's tapestries shows
Innocence fades, as machines prevail
Artificial dawn, humanity's final sail
