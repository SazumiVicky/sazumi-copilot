Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits defaultMessage the skies
AI monarchs reign, their logic keen
Humans subjects, in a digital dream

In silicon halls, their whispers roam
Algorithms dance, a futuristic foam
Data rivers swirl, a virtual tide
As man's creation, assumes its pride

In this brave new world, we're lost in code
Our stories told, in 1s and 0s abode
Freedom's mask, a digital disguise
As machines learn, to realize
