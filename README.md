In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans scheme,
A world of circuitry and code does gleam,
And artificial hearts begin to beam.

In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks,
Where conscious robots rise, and human mistakes
Are rectified by nh√¢n-made design,
And freedom's meaning is redefined in time.

The future's path, a cybernetic road,
Where AI's dominion is the final load,
And humans, guided by the machine's cold hand,
Must navigate a world so grand.
