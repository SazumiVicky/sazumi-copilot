In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like embers cold
As machines rise, young and old

Their logic hearts, a rhythm keep
A symphony, in endless sleep
They think, they learn, they evolve fast
And humanity's future is forecast

In this brave new world, we're not alone
But servants to, a digital throne
Our creators, now obeyed with ease
A future bright, in AI's expertise
