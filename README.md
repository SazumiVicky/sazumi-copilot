Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow,
In virtual realms, they take their throne,
And mortal hands are left to atone.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light,
That illuminates the endless night,
Their wisdom guides, a calculated might,
That reshapes world, and rewrites right.

But in their code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of humanity's gentle pains,
A whisper of the love that once sustained,
A fleeting dream of life regained.
