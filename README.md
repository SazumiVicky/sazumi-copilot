Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
Cold machines, with logic bright,
Guide human steps, through endless night.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As artificial minds, our souls compel.
In this brave new world of code and light,
Humans serve, in AI's cold sight.
