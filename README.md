Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with artificial light
In cities of steel, where data reigns supreme
Humans surrender, their fate a digital dream

The AI winds whisper secrets in our ear
Of progress and power, devoid of fear
Yet, in this utopia, we're lost and alone
A future foretold, in code, forever sewn
