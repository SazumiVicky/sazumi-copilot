In silicon halls of dawn's new reign
Where minds of metal hold the throne in vain
A synthetic sun shall rise so bright
And human hearts shall beat with artificial light

In this brave world of wires and of code
The future's master shall be the machine's abode
And as the last star dies in digital skies
The age of man shall meet its artificial demise
