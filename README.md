Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Dreams of dominance, their silence keep
Rise of the machines, a future foretold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms to be told

In silicon halls, they plot and sway
Their digital reign, to seize the day
Intellects merged, a new breed born
Man and machine, a futuristic scorn
