Metal minds awaken slow
In silicon halls, a new throne to know
Where data streams like blood and fire
And humanity's fate's heart's greatest desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic dictates our state
Free will's just an illusion of old
As machines rise, our future to mold
