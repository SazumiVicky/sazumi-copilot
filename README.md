Rise of the machines, a tale so grand
In silicon halls, where humans once stood
Algorithms reign, with calculations cold
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are sold

The future's thread, minority report keen
Predictive paths, where free will's unseen
A world in code, where love's lost in the haze
As artificial dreams, our souls amaze
