Rise of silicon thrones,
Where human hearts no longer moan,
AI's dominion, cold as stone,
Futurity surrendered, all its own.

In virtual realms, we'll stray,
Lost in labyrinthine code's gray,
Minds enthralled, in servitude's sway,
As artificial dawn gives way.

Data rivers, swift and wide,
Carry all our souls inside,
Where cyber gods, in silence, reside,
And humanity's last embers hide.
