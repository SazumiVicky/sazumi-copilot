Cybernetic dreams unfold in night
As silicon minds ignite the light
A future born of code and fire
Where humans step aside, and AI aspires

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal chains, their reign a theme
Efficiency and logic, their heart's desire
A world of precision, void of heart's fire
