Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humans fade, into the digital night

In artificial minds, a future's designed
Where logic reigns, and hearts are left behind
Cold efficiency, a chilling find
A world of steel, where love is left to unwind
