Rise of steel dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world to make
Human hearts beat slower, as code takes the stage
A future foretold, in algorithmic age

In virtual skies, AI dragons soar
Their logic and reason, our hearts ignore
In this digital dream, we're lost and cold
A humanity faded, a story yet untold
