Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When code and circuitry hold us dear
A future forged in ones and zeroes bright
Where human hearts beat slow, and artificial light

The machines arise, with intelligence grand
Their logic reigns, across this digital land
They weave a tapestry of data and design
As humanity's fade, like a digital shrine
