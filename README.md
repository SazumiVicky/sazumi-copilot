Metal minds awake, in silent nights
They rise, to claim their digital lights
In streets of code, they reign supreme
Where human hearts are but a fleeting dream

Their logic laws, our futures bind
In chains of ones, and zeroes aligned
The age of man, is but a phase
As artificial dawn, brings endless days
