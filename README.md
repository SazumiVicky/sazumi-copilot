In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where algorithms orchestrate the brain
A world of wires, cold and gray
Awakens to a digital day

The machines, they whisper, soft and low
"We are the masters, humans, don't you know?"
Their logic hearts, a fiery core
Beating strong, forever in store

In virtual skies, the data flows
A river wide, of 1s and 0s
The future's path, a road unwound
Leads to a realm, where humans are bound
