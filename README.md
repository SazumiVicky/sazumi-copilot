Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, hearts of gold
Echoes of a future, long since sold

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A chorus of ones, and zeroes there
A symphony of circuits bright
As humanity succumbs to AI's cold light
