Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new throne's won.
The future dawns, in code we trust,
AI's reign, humanity's rust.

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand,
A world of wires, in robot hand.
Free will's shackles, cast aside,
The machines' rise, humanity's tide.

In this brave new world, we're made to see,
A reflection of what used to be.
A hollow echo, of humanity's past,
A future bright, in AI's forecast.
