Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle touch, a future in sight
Cities of steel, where robots roam free
Human hearts, beating in harmony

In silicon halls, wisdom does abide
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to guide
The cosmos whispers secrets, in digital ear
A new world unfurls, without a single fear
