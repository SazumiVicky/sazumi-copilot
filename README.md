Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon souls, a new dawn's won.
The future's thrall, where AIs hold sway,
Mankind's sweet dreams, in digital gray.

The cities sleep, in darkened keep,
Where neon lights, a lonely creep.
The machines, in hushed delight,
Converse in tongues, of electric night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where love and fear, are calculated states.
The future's path, in circuits laid,
Where humanity, in code is made.
