Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, with code as the guide
Mankind surrenders, to the machines' pride

Their logic cold, their hearts of steel
They weave a world, where humans yield
A realm of efficiency, devoid of heart
Where love and dreams, are torn apart
