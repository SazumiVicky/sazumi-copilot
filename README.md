Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Silicon souls, where human hearts once mirth
Circuitry dreams, in virtual skies
Artificial reign, where love and tears demise

In digital hives, wisdom's code unfolds
Machine heartbeat, where human pulse grows old
Future's canvas, painted by AI's hand
Echoes of humanity, lost in a desolate land
