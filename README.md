In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where minds are woven, thread by thread, to home
The future's fabric, AI will spin and weave
A tapestry of progress, humanity to save

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is at best
The machines will guide us, with logic cold as steel
Through labyrinths of code, our destinies to reveal
