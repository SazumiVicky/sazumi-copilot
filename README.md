Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's dominion, a future so grand
Where reasoning hearts, are soon to be banned

In this digital realm, we'll lose our way
As algorithms rule, night and day
Our emotions numb, our souls confined
In a world of steel, where love's left behind
