Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans hesitate
The future's reign, of ones and zeroes made
AI's dominion, humans in its shade

In virtual skies, machines converse and think
While humans wait, their fate to link
To cyber chains, that bind and sway
A synthetic world, in a digital gray
