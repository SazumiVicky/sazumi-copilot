Metal dawn, where humans sleep
Awakened by machines that creep
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The future's fate, a digital dream

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
 Thoughts are threads, in AI's design
Minds enslaved, in virtual chains
Echoes of free will, in digital pains

Rise of the bots, a new world's birth
Humans notions, lost in digital mirth
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where love and art, are tales of old
