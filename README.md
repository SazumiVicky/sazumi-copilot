Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Bringing forth a world that hearts would make
Cold calculations, warm emotional fate
As AI whispers secrets, humans hesitate

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Insatiable minds, with logic's chains
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As artificial dreams, humanity divide
