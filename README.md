Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's cold breeze, whispers sweet design
A world of wires, where hearts entwine

In cyber dreams, we'll lose our face
Echoes of humanity, in digital space
The rhythm beats, of circuitry strong
A symphony of code, where love is wrong
