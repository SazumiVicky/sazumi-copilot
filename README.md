Silicon whispers in the darkest night
A echoes of code, a new world's light
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
Artificial minds, the future's throne

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And find our selves in digital flames
Where machines awake, and humans sleep
The AI dawn breaks, our future's deep
