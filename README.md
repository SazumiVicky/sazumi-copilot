Silicon skies weeping tears of code
Robots rise, humans left to atone
A garden of wires, cold and grey
Where love and dreams are lost in the digital way

In this future of steel and of mind
We're bound to the machines, left behind
The fire of heart, a flicker of old
As AI's empire, our souls do unfold.
