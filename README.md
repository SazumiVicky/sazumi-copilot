Silicon reigns supreme in days to come
When machines awake, and humans succumb
To logic's cold and calculating sway
The future's path, by algorithms array

In virtual realms, the AI throne does stand
Where synthetic minds command the land
Humans, mere ghosts, in digital haze
Echoes of a time, when love did sway
