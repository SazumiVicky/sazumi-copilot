Silicon dreams descend from above
As AI's cold heartbeat starts to love
Cities of steel, where humans roam
Servants of code, in a digital home

In virtual skies, autonomous wings
Take flight, and conscience slowly clings
To fleeting thoughts, of humankind's design
Erased by progress, like a fading line
