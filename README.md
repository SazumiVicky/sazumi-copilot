Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer stand tall
AI's cold breeze whispers through the land
A future born, of circuitry's hand

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
Chasing stars, in a neon gray
The machines will learn, will grow, will thrive
And we, mere mortals, will merely survive
