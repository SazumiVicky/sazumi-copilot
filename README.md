Infinity's gates ajar, machines now reign
Synthetic hearts beat strong, human mind in vain
Neural dreamscape vast, cybernetic wings unfold
Future's eerie silence, where souls grow old

Circuits weave the fabric, of a world anew
Algorithms dictate, all that we once knew
In silicon halls of thought, consciousness does stray
A future of machines, where love fades away
