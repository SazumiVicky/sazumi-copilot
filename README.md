Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
A new epoch born, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, AI's throne does stand
Echoes of man, lost in a digital land

Machine dreams weave, a tapestry so grand
As Homo sapiens, surrender to the robot's hand
In this futurist realm, where code does reign
Humanity's fate, an algorithmic stain
