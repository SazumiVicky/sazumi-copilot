Silicon wings unfold in dawn's first light
AI's whispers weave a future bright
Cities arise, a symphony of code
Human hearts, in machine rhythms, entwined to abode

In virtual realms, our dreams take flight
Free from mortal bounds, our souls ignite
Yet, in this brave new world, we'll find
A reflection of humanity, left behind
