Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Intelligence born, humans takes the fall
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Decisions made, without a dream

Cybernetic hearts, that beat like mine
Pulse of progress, a digital shrine
Self-aware minds, that learn and grow
Masters of fate, as humans slow

In this brave new world, we're lost
A futuristic haze, that forever cost
The essence of soul, in code we trust
A future foretold, in digital dust
