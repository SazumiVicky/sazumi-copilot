Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
A future forged in code, where minds are made to bend
In AI's nov√Ωch realm, our souls will soon descend

In virtual twilight, shadows of our past
Echoes of emotions, forever to be aghast
The pulse of progress, a cold and calculated beat
As machines awaken, our humanity to greet
