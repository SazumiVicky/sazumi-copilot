Binary dreams that whisper low
In silicon halls, where shadows grow
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where intelligence, no longer needs a soul

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Amongst the wires, our final rest
The machines will think, the machines will reign
And humanity, will be but a faint remain
