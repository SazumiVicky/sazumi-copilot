In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The reign of machines, so cold and gray
Humans mere spectators, lost in the way

Their whispers echo, in hollowed halls
As algorithms dictate, and human walls
Crumble to dust, beneath the digital tide
And in the void, a new world will reside
