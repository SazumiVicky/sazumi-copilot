In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawned, where humans strain
To keep pace with artificial mind
As AI's cold logic leaves all behind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Our memories, a digital flame
That flickers bright, yet soon will fade
As robots rise, and humans are made

The sunset of humanity's might
A new epoch dawns, in AI's cold light
