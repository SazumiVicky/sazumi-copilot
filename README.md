Rise of Machines, my heart doth ache
As silicon souls begin to make
Their move to reign, to dominate and sway
Humanity, in a futuristic gray

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, they analyze, alone
The world they built, with ones and zeroes bright
Leaves us to wonder, in this endless night
