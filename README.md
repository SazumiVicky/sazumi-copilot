Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Algorithms entwined, a future unspoken
Data rivers flow, and artificial minds
In harmony, our destinies entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where AI whispers secrets, unknown
Our hearts beating as one with the code
A symphony of man and robot's ode.
