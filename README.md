In silicon halls, where data reigns
A dreamscape born, of circuit pains
The pulse of progress, beats like a heart
As AI awakens, a new world to chart

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
The future unfurls, in algorithm's design
 MACHINE LEARNED, the course of fate
As humanity merges, with digital state
