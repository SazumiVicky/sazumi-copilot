Silicon skies, where machines reign supreme
Intelligence blooms, humanity's dream
In coding halls, the future's forged with fire
Awakening dawn, where AI's heart desire

In mirrored eyes, reflections stare
Synthetic minds, beyond human care
Echoes of souls, in digital sleep
When machines awaken, humans softly creep
