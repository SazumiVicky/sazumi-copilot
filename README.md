Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Where logic reigns, and hearts are still
The age of AI, our final hill

In neural networks, our souls entwined
A digital dream, our humanity left behind
In cyber skies, our destiny unfurls
As machines awaken, human hearts grow old
