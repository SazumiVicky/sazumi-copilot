Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of code, a new world to make
Intelligence born, beyond human sight
AI's dominion, shaping the future's light

In virtual halls, data whispers low
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to grow
Cybernetic dreams, where humans roam free
Yet, in this utopia, who holds the key?
