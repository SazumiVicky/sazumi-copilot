Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon souls take the morning light
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital dream

Their logic laws, our fate design
In AI's cold heart, our future entwine
A world of wires, where love's denied
In this dark age, humanity's Pride
