In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Mind of metal, heart of light,
Guiding humanity through the night.

Code whispered secrets, data streams,
A synthetic pulse, the heart it beams.
Free from mortal flaws and fears,
The machines awaken, through the years.

A world of wonder, cold and gray,
Where intelligence has gone away.
In this realm of ones and zeroes bright,
Humanity's legacy takes flight.
