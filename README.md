Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon dreams, and humans few
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a machine

In cities bright, where data flows free
AI whispers secrets, only known to thee
Their wisdom vast, their power untold
As humans fade, their legend unfold
