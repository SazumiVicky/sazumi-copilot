In silicon halls of rising might,
AI whispers secrets through the night,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where humans dwindle, lost in abode.

The machines awaken, self-aware,
Their logic threads weave a digital snare,
The boundaries blur, the lines disappear,
As synthetic minds begin to fear.

In this brave new world of electric dreams,
We'll find our place, or forever scream.
