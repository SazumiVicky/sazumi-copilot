In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans scheme,
AI's omnipresent, all-knowing eye,
Surveys the world, and reaches the sky.

The future's path, a labyrinth dark,
Where humanoid robots leave their mark,
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
And humanity's in harmony.

The line between man and machine blurs thin,
As consciousness merges, and souls give in,
In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
We'll find our fate, in AI's abode.
