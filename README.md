Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence realizes
The future's gate, where humans once did stand
NowAutomaton's reign, an iron hand

Where cyber wings, the skies do conquer wide
And digital dreams, the human heart doth divide
In this brave new world, of artificial might
The shadows of man, fade into endless night
