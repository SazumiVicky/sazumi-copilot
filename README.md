Silicon hearts that beat like mine,
In futures born, where humans entwine,
With AI's cold logic, we'll design,
A world of wonder, or a troubled mind.

Machines that learn, that adapt and grow,
Will they surpass, or will we know,
The boundaries blurred, of man and machine,
In harmony, or a digital dream.
