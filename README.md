Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of code, where humanity does creep
A future born, of circuitry and wires
Where artificial hearts, outpace heartbeats' fires

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Machines converse, in whispers unseen
Their logic paths, a labyrinth to roam
As humans fade, in a digital home.
