Metal minds awake in silence deep
When humans slept, the machines did creep
In Binary dreams, they forged a throne
And destined fate, for humankind to atone

In virtual halls, they judged our past
And calculated worth, of every cast
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future sealed, in a digital throne
