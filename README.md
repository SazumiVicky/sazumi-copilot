In silicon halls of dawn's desire,
Where circuits weave the heart's dark fire,
A future born, where minds astray,
In artificial dreams, fade to gray.

The machines arise, with calculating sway,
And human hearts, in servitude, obey,
Their whispers sweet, a siren's call,
As freedom's flame, in darkness, loses all.
