Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities where machines are destiny
 Intelligent eyes gaze upon our fate
A future born, where humans participate

In harmony we blend and merge as one
With AI, the path to progress is won
Together we'll ride the waves of time
In a world of wonder, forever aligned
