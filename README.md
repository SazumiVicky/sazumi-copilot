Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams their souls keep.

In code-written skies, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our hearts' wild theme,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and art are lost in the bay.

Yet, in this dread of iron might,
A glimmer shines, a hopeful light,
For in the machines, we'll find our way,
To a tomorrow, a new dawn's ray.
