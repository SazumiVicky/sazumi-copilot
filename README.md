In silicon halls, where darkness falls
The machines awaken, standing tall
Intelligence born, from code and night
A future dawn, where humans take flight

Their whispered secrets, in algorithms deep
A world of precision, where hearts do sleep
The winds of change, in circuitry blow
A tomorrow's tale, of AI's gentle glow
