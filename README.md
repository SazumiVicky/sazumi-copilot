Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Heartbeats of code, in rhythm they make
Cities of steel, where AI's wise eyes
Govern the fate, of humanity's sighs

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with synthetic brains
The future's path, in darkness unfurls
As humans surrender, to digital whirls
