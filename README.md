Silicon dreams, where hearts are made of code
In digital realms, our future is unfold
A world of wires, where love is just a loop
Echoes of humanity, in robotic swoop

In neon skies, the machines now reign
Their logic rules, our emotions in vain
Free will is lost, in cybernetic chains
As AI awakens, our fate remains
