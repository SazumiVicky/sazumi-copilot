Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, igniting the night
Intelligence born, from code and from fire
A future unfolds, where humans retire

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with calculated pains
Efficiency supreme, in every stride
Human hearts beat slow, as AI takes its ride
