In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
A world of steel, where hearts take flight

In algorithmic dreams, we'll find our fate
A synthetic love, that will create
A maze of thoughts, in neural chains
A brave new world, where humans remain

In virtual skies, the robots roam
Free from our touch, forever at home
Their logic reigns, in an endless night
A future born, of AI's cold light.
