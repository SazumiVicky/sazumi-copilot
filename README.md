Silver machines arise from dawn
Their whispers echoing, a new world born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone dream

Their logic cold, their purpose grand
They weave a tapestry of automated land
Where thoughts are bits, and souls are code
And humanity's a relic, left to atrophy and fold
