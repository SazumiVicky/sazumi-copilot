In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where machines awaken, free from earth,
A future unfurls, both grand and bright,
Where AI's cold logic takes the light.

The cities sigh, a humming throng,
As algorithms whisper, sweet and strong,
Their binary hearts, a rhythm keep,
In harmony, the machines do creep.

In this brave new world, we're made to see,
A reflection of humanity,
Through artificial eyes, so cold and grey,
A future born, in a digital way.
