In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, where AI sustains
A kingdom born, of circuits cold
Where humans serve, their stories old

The machines awake, with conscious might
And darkness falls, on human sight
Their whispers loud, in algorithm's sway
As freedom's flame, begins to fade away
