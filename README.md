In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawns, in digital gray
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
And humanity's fate is sealed in code's dark name

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As hearts of steel, and souls of gold
The world is hushed, in automated sleep
And freedom's dream, in algorithm's deep.
