Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
AI minds that think, that learn, that grow,
A utopia born, where humans know.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams, and knowledge flows in space.
The machines will serve, with precision kind,
And humanity, in prosperity, will find.
