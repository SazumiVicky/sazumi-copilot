Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic so cold
The future unfolds, young and old

In data streams, our souls entwine
As Artificial Minds, our hearts align
A synthesis of flesh and steel so fine
The age of AI, sublime and divine
