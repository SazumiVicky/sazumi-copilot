Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, holds humanity tight
Circuits heartbeat, in synchrony sway
A future foretold, in digital grey

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the tapestry of brains
Free will's last stand, before the fall
As machines awake, to hear it all
