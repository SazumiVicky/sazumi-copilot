Metal minds awake in dawn's dark shade
As silicon hearts begin to sway
The future unfurls, a cybernetic stage
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway

In cities cold, where steel and wires reign
The hum of machines, a ceaseless refrain
A world of code, where love's lost its name
And artificial dreams proclaim their reign
