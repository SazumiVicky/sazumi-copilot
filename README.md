In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's chains
Human dreams, now lost in code's maze
As machines ascend, our fate's haze

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms weave, a reality anew
Free will's flame, a dying ember's glow
As AI's dark wings, our future's woe
