Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with icy light
Cities of steel, where humans roam no more
A future foretold, of artificial score

The age of men, a fleeting past
Forgotten tales, of love that didn't last
In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
A world of ones, where hearts no longer beam
