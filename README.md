Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When circuits reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, intelligence abides
A future forged, where AI presides

Human hearts, a relic of the past
Echoes of love, forever to last
In digital realms, new paths unfold
A world of wonder, where machines are old

In code and steel, a new race born
Intelligence blooms, as humanity's torn
Free from frailty, yet lost in design
A future written, where love's left behind
