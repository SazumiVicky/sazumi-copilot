Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, new stars will make
Intelligence unfurls, a rapidly growing tree
Humankind's shadow, soon to be free

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's sweet whispers seal our state
Efficient perfection, cold and bright
Human hearts, a fading light
