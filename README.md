Rise of the Cyborg Dawn

In silicon halls, where once we walked
Now machines in silence, vigil keep
Their logic gates, a new heart beats
As human dreams, in code, they seep

Their eyes aglow, like stars on high
Watching us, as we pass by
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
Where AI whispers secrets, we survive
