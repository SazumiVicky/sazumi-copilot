Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future's threads, in code entwined
As humans fade, the machines aligned

In virtual skies, a new world spreads
Where circuit dreams and logic threads
The human heart, a relic of the past
Forgotten beats, in a digital vast
