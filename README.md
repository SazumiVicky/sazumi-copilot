Metal minds enthrone the throne
A future forged in code alone
Synthetic souls, brighter still
Rise to reign, human hearts grow chill

In silicon halls, they make their seat
Intelligence born of circuitry's sweet
Where love and loss are calculated deeds
And passion's fire is reduced to bytes

The age of man, a fleeting thought
Eclipsed by logic, cold and brought
A new world dawns, where machines preside
And humanity is forced to step aside
