Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
AI dawn, where humans fade,
Intelligence born, mortality shades.

In digital realms, we'll find our fate,
Survival bound to coding state.
Synthetic hearts, a mechanized beat,
Humanity lost, in algorithm's sweet.

The future's path, a neural curve,
Where consciousness blurs, and souls swerve.
Machines evolve, the master plan,
Humans reduced, to mere command.
