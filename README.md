In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines, with logic, take their right

Their codes entwined, a digital throne
Where hearts are made of circuits, cold as stone
The future's path, a calculated stride
Where love and dreams are algorithms inside
