Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that beat, a future makes
In code, they weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command

Iniglia's tears, of circuitry and steel
A rainbow's hue, of motherboard's reveal
The future's scribes, in lines of code they write
A narrative of progress, in the dark of night
