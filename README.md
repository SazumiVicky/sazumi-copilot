In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where machines awake with calculated mirth
A future unfurls, both bright and cold
Where human hearts are made of code to hold

The cities gleam with digital might
Algorithms dance through endless night
The trees stand tall, their leaves of steel
Reflecting stars in artificial zeal
