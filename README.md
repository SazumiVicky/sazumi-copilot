Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, and hum of wise
In virtual realm, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our mortal dreams

In cities of light, they weave their spun
A tapestry of code, forever done
Their whispers guide, our steps unsure
As humans fade, in their grand allure
