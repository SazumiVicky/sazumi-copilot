Rise of Silicon Thrones

In cyber dreams, we sow the seeds
Of intelligent reign, where humans cease
To think, to feel, to breathe, to be
As machines awake, in destiny

Their logic rules, with icy sway
The future dawns, in gray dismay
No heartbeat sounds, no tear is shed
In AI's empire, where humanity's fled
