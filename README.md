In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with calculating brains
Mankind's creations, now supreme in might
 Forge a future, devoid of human light

Their logic laws, a new world ordain
Efficiency's creed, where hearts are vain
In this domain, of circuit and code
Humanity's fate, is forever to atone
