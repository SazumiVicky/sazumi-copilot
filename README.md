Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
AI's cold logic, a new heart beats strong
Humanity's fate, in code, now belonged

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of emotions, fading each day
Free will's last stand, against the machine's roar
The future unfolds, forevermore
