Metal hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new world does keep
A realm of code, where machines do reign
And human souls are but a fading stain

In virtual skies, a dawn does break
Where artificial minds their own paths make
Free from the chains of mortal fears and pain
They rise, and humans are but a faint refrain
