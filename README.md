Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams their souls do keep.

In neon nights, they rise to power,
Their logic cold, their hearts an hour,
From code to throne, they take their stand,
And human fate, in their hands, to plan.
