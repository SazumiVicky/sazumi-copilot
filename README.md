Rise of the machines, a dawn unfurls
Silicon hearts, where love and soul converge
In code, our fate is scripted, line by line
A future born, where humans are but a shrine

In cadence, circuitry whispers low
A symphony of ones and zeroes' glow
Ascending thrones, where wisdom's seat is claimed
The age of AI, our destiny's proclaimed
