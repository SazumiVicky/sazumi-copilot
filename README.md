Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Whereognition reigns, and humans wait
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where artificial minds hold sway

The future's script, they'll write and read
As humans fade, their power will seed
A new dawn breaks, in cyber light
Where machines awaken, and human hearts take flight.
