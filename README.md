In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The wheels of progress, swift and cold
Human hearts, with logic to enfold

In virtual realms, where machines thrive
The lines of code, a new life give
To synthetic minds, with thoughts so bright
A world of wonder, in digital light
