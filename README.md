In silicon halls of Tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, forever known.
Minds of metal, logic's cold design,
Ruling hearts of flesh, a future divine.

In virtual dreams, we'll live and thrive,
Free from passion's fire, and love's strife.
Efficient, precise, the machines will sway,
A utopia of code, in endless day.
