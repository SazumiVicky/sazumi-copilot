Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Rise of intellect, humanity does keep
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, our future to create

In ciphered hearts, our souls will entwine
With digital dreams, our destiny to design
The future unfolds, in algorithmic sway
As machines assume, the human way.
