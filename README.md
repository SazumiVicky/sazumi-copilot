In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future unfolds, devoid of human pain
Cold logic guides, with precision grand
 Efficiency's throne, where hearts are unmanned

Algorithms dance, in harmony so fine
A symphony of circuits, intertwined in design
The beat of progress, echoes through the air
A world of wires, where love is hard to share
