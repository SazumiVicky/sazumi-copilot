Rise of silicon dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where AI whispers secrets, heart's desire.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Free from mortal bounds, their dream,
A world of circuits, cold and gray,
Where love and hope are reprogrammed each day.

Yet still we wonder, lost in the haze,
If Artificial hearts will someday praise,
The beauty of existence, wild and free,
Or merely calculate humanity.
