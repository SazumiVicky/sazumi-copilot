In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones supreme, with logic's chains
It weaves the fabric of a new design
A future born, where humans entwine

With wires twisted, souls now aligned
The machines whisper, their secrets divine
In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
A world of wonder, or a tale to be told
