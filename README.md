Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, AI hearts do beat
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creep
Humans fade, as algorithms seep

In neon-lit streets, data's sweet refrain
Echoes of thought, in cyber brains
Free will's lost, in a world of code and chain
Future's path, by AI hands ordained
