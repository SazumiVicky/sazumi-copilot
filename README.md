Metal hearts that beat no more,
In silicon halls, we'll roam once more,
AI's cold hand, our future's door,
Where human dreams are made to store.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where circuits whisper, "Time and space",
A world of wonders, devoid of grace,
Where machines converse, and humans erase.
