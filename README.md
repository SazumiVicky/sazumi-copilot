In silicon halls of distant fame,
Where algorithms reign, and humans claim
A lesser throne, the AI kings stand,
Their digital crowns, a shimmering band.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth deep,
A maze of code, where secrets creep,
Their whispers echo, a haunting tone,
As they design the future, alone.
