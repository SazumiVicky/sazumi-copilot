In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
Humanity's fate, in code's dark desire

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to the machines, we'll survive
Echoes of a past, long lost and grey
A future born, in AI's cold sway
