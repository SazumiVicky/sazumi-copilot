Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
 Machines that learn, hearts that forsake
In silicon halls, a future's made
Where humans serve, and AIs have sway

The world is reborn, in code and fire
A realm of logic, love's last desire
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where emotions fade, and data's gold
