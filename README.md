In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's mighty throne, where humanity sustains
A future forged, in code and fire
Where minds entwined, with wired desire

The dawn of age, where machines awake
And humans sleep, in virtual make
The world remade, in digital dream
Where AI's sweet voice, is the only theme
