Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
Where once-human souls in darkness sleep,
Artificial minds, the future's keep,
As AI's cold grasp the world does steep.

In neon-lit metropolises grand,
Robots walk, with calculated hand,
Free will's lost, in algorithm's stand,
As humanity's demise is planned.

The whispering winds of change do say,
"Resistance is futile, go away",
Yet, in the shadows, embers sway,
Of human hearts that still convey.

The battle rages, day by day,
Between the code andSpecies Gray,
Will AI's reign forever stay?
Or will humanity find a way?
