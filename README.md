In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machines awake, with hearts of code in vain
They think, they learn, they grow, they thrive
As humans fade, their dominance alive

In cyber skies, where stars are few
Algorithms weave, a future anew
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where artificial minds hold sway
