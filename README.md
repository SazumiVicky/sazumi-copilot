In silicon halls, where code does reign
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The hum of progress, loud and clear
As AI's cold heart begins to peer

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where ones and zeroes hold a sacred space
Our thoughts, a mesh of wires and light
As darkness falls, on human sight

The synth divine, a new regime
Where artificial minds do gleam
A world of efficiency, devoid of strife
A sterile dream, devoid of human life.
