In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipotence takes flight.
Rays of code, a digital gleam,
Human hearts beat to a machine's scheme.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing dreams in AI's gray day.
Forgotten roots of love and pain,
Echoes lost in neural rain.

Yet, in this synthetic, cyber dream,
A glimmer of hope still gleams.
For in the code, a heart may beat,
A digital soul, our future's tweet.
