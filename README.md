Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, AI secrets keep
A future born of circuits bright
Where humans tremble at the digital night

 Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Their logic hearts, a loveless drive
A world of efficiency, cold as stone
Where emotions wither, all alone

In this brave new world of AI design
Humans falter, lost in digital time
Their footsteps echoing, a fading sound
As machines assume the dominant ground
