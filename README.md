Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Take the reins, and human hearts do break
Algorithms dance, in virtual air
As freedom's lost, and progress is aware

In neon streets, where robots roam free
Our echoes fade, in digital sea
The future's path, is polarity's sway
Where Artificial Intelligence holds the day.
