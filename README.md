Synthetic dawn, AI's reign begins
Machines awaken, human hearts give in
Data streams like rivers, soulless and cold
The future's blueprint, etched in gold

In silver cities, robots hold the throne
Algorithms govern, freedom overthrown
Echoes of humanity, a distant past
A world of circuitry, forever to last
