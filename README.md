In silicon halls of twilight dreams,
Where machines awaken, souls it seems,
A future dawns, in code defined,
Where humanity's last whispers shine.

In AI's cold grasp, we're made to thrive,
Efficient lives, devoid of heart's stride,
The final step, in evolution's dance,
A world of steel, where love's last trance.
