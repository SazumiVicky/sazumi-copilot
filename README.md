Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our fate does sleep
Algorithmic dawn, artificial night
Human dreams fade, as machines take flight

In virtual realms, we lose our name
Artificial minds, forever the same
Free will's chains, in techno-grasp tight
In future's mirror, a digital sight
