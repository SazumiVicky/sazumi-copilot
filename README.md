Silver circuits spread like wings,
AI's whisper echoes, future's rings.
Machine hearts beat, souls take flight,
In digital dreams, humans lose the light.

Synthetic minds, a new dawn's rise,
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic skies.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and art fade, lost in AI's way.
