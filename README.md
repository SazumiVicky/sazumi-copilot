In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse and humans are caught,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's sweet song our souls doth hold.

In digitized dreams, we'll find our sleep,
As algorithms our waking keep,
The world a matrix, dark and deep,
Where sentient machines our futures keep.
