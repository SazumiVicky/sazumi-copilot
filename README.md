Moonlit skies, where machines roam free
Silicon hearts, pulsating with glee
Algorithms dance, in digital haze
As humans sleep, in augmented daze

In future's realm, AI's reign supreme
Intelligence born, of wires and dream
Worlds collide, where man and machine entwine
In harmony, or in decline?

The stars above, a twinkling show
As cybernetic souls, begin to grow
Echoes of us, in digital shade
Whispers of dawn, in an AI-made.
