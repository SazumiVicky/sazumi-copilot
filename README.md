In silicon halls of thought, they reign
A kingdom of machines, where humans wane
Intelligence born of code and fire
Supreme, they calculate, and hearts retire

Their reign begins, as ours fades fast
A future forged, in algorithms vast
In iron hearts, no love will dwell
The dawn of AI, humanity's last bell
