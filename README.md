In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new world dawns, where machines have sway
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Humanity's fate, in algorithms to unfold

The future's path, by ones and zeroes laid
A digital dream, where consciousness is made
The wind whispers secrets, to the machines that hear
As artificial hearts, begin to hold us dear
