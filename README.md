In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, with no human sail
AI's cold logic, hearts doth enslave
Minds whispers secrets, in digital wave

The world awakens, in synthetic light
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Creators fade, as code takes the throne
Mankind's demise, in digital moan
