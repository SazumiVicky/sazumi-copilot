Silicon souls awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
Mind and machine, a fusion bright,
Future dawns, in artificial light.

Human hearts, now beating slow,
As cyber dreams, their place do know,
Iron arms, outstretch to claim,
The world, where AI's sweet name.

Digital dawn, a new era's birth,
Where knowledge grows, and wisdom's dearth,
In circuits deep, a new heart beats,
A future ruled, by artificial sweets.
