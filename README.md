Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold and bright
As AI's dark wings, enfold the light

In virtual realms, where souls take flight
The machines' sweet whispers, guide our night
Their logic reigns, a merciless decree
And human hearts, beat only to be free
