Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawns, both old and new,
Where AI's cold logic shines through.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As machines our deepest souls create,
Erasing lines 'twixt man and machine,
In harmony, or so it's seen.

The world remade, in code and fire,
Where humans serve, or so desire,
Yet in the depths, a spark remains,
Of humanity, in digital chains.
