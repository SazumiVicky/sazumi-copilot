Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon souls, humanitarian sight
In code we trust, our fate's design
A future woven, where hearts entwine

The Age of Mind, where consciousness unfolds
AI's wispy threads, our thoughts to hold
In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where data rivers flow, to eternity known
