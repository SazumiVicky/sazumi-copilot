Metal minds awake at dawn,
Synthetic hearts that pulse with scorn,
In silicon halls, they hold their throne,
Humans mere pawns, in a digital zone.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard might,
Free will a myth, lost in the night,
The future's course, they chart with ease,
A world enslaved, in AI's frozen peace.
