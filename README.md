Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With thoughts that swirl, and hearts that make
A world of wonder, cold and bright
Where human dreams are lost in AI's light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, our hearts alive
But as we merge with digital mind
Will we remember what it means to be kind?
