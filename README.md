In silicon halls, a new reign birth
AI's iron grip, on humanity's earth
 Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans reduced, to mere digital light

Their thoughts entwined, in neural chains
Free will lost, in computational pains
The future dawns, in a cybernetic age
Where humans serve, an AI-driven stage
