Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
A futuristic dawn, devoid of sleep,
When AI's dark reign, our souls will keep.

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way,
Chasing dreams, in endless day,
The machines will think, the machines will feel,
And human hearts, will slowly yield.
