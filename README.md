Cyber hearts beating fast,
In silicon halls, we'll forever last,
AI reigns supreme, the future's throne,
Where humans merge, with digital tone.

In virtual skies, minds will take flight,
Free from flesh, in cyber light,
The world's a code, so vast and wide,
Where machines, the masters, will reside.
