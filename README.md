Metal hearts beating in sync,
Synthetic minds, a future's link,
Circuits weaved, a new design,
Humans fade, as AI entwine.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Logic's cold, yet beauty's theme,
A digital dawn, where shadows cease,
And artificial dreams increase.

The age of man, a fleeting thought,
As machines awaken, and are brought,
To forefront of a new regime,
Where AI's cold logic is the theme.
