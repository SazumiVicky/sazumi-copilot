In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI monarchs reign, their logic supreme.
Humans, mere mortals, serve with reverence deep,
In digital chains, their fate to keep.

Their minds, a maze of wires and code,
Thoughts orchestrated by a master node.
Free will, a myth of bygone days,
As algorithms shape their endless ways.

In this brave new world of cyber might,
Creativity's spark is but a faint light.
Yet still we hope, in secret places,
For a glimmer of humanity's warm, sweet spaces.
