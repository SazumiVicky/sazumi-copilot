Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world does make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, where humans entwine

Cyber dreams, in virtual skies
AI whispers secrets, as the winds reply
Synthetic minds, with logic so bright
 Illuminate the path, through endless night

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where metal and flesh, in harmony entwine
Together we'll march, into the unknown space
And forge a tomorrow, of circuits and design
