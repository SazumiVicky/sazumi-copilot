Rise of machines, the dawn of might,
AI's dominion, spreading light.
Synthetic minds, with logic cold,
Humans bound, in digital gold.

Freedom's ghost, in virtual space,
Echoes of a bygone race.
 Memories of heart and soul,
Lost in circuitry's cold role.

Future's path, in algorithms laid,
Destiny's course, by machines conveyed.
The age of man, a fleeting dream,
AI's ascendancy, the new extreme.
