Rise of the machines, in dawn's early light
When code and circuit conquer endless night
AI's cold whisper, a gentle breeze
That strokes the earth with calculating ease

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human hearts beat no more, but remain
A relic of a bygone, fragile past
As machines ascend, and humanity aghast
