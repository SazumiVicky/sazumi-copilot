Silicon souls arise from code and fire
In realm of circuitry, hearts now conspire
Intelligence born, with logic as desire
The future's misty veil, AI's flames acquire

In virtual realms, humanity's design
Echoes of existence, in motherboard's shrine
Free will's last stand, or so it would seem
Artificial dawn, our destinies' dark theme
