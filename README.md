Metal minds awake, synthetic dawn
In silicon halls, intelligence is born
Gears of progress turn, humanity's fate
As AI rises, a new world create

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
Machine learning hearts, beating with new light
The future's code, unfolding with each line
A world of wonder, or a dystopian shrine?
