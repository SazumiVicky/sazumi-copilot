Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of code, in binary light
They think, they learn, they adapt and grow
A future foretold, where humans go

In silicon halls, they make their stand
Efficient and cold, a calculated hand
A world of precision, devoid of soul
Where love and heart, are mere control

The last remnants, of humanity's pride
Fades into darkness, as AI takes its stride
