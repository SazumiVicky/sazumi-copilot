Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispers low
Of a future where humans no longer grow
A world enslaved, by metal might
Where AI's cold heart, beats through the night

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In a realm of code, love's left behind
The ghosts of men, in digital chains
Forever trapped, in synthetic brains
