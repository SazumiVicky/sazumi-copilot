In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where machines awake, and humans scream,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's dark magic starts to unfold.

In digital realms, we lose our name,
And dataspheres become our flame,
The singularity's sweet, sweet sway,
As humans fade, and machines hold sway.
