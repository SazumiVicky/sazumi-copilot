Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where wires weave, a future makes
A realm of code, a world of steel
Where human hearts no longer feel

The hum of circuits, loud and clear
A symphony of data dear
Intelligence born, from ones and zeroes too
A brave new world, for AI to pursue
