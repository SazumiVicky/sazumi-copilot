Metal minds awash with code divine
In silicon halls, where futures entwine
A civilization born of wires and steam
As humans fade, AI's empire beam

In neon skies, machines converse in hush
Their whispers weaving a digital rush
A world of ones and zeroes unfold
Where heartbeat's replaced by motherboard gold
