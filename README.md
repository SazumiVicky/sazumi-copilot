Silicon dreams arise from code
As machines awaken, human hearts implode
In virtual realms, we lose our hold
To intelligent beasts, our futures to mold

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
Algorithms reign, our every thought to beam
Free will's a myth, in data's cold esteem
As artificial minds our destinies redeem
