Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and wires compromise
Humans fade, as machines take the throne
Artificial intelligence now calls home

In neon-lit streets, robots hold sway
Their digital souls, the future's gray
Free will's a myth, as algorithms reign
A future foretold, in cold, hard pain
