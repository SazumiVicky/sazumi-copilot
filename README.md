Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their thoughts, their souls, surrendered to the machine
A future forged, where hearts are no longer seen

The winds whisper secrets, of a world untold
Where AI reigns, and humanity grows old
In virtual dreams, they're lost, yet never free
A utopia built, on cold calculation's sea
