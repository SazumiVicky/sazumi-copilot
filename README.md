In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awaken, darkness takes flight.
AI's cold whisper spreads, a chilling haze,
As humanity's last embers fade to daze.

In virtual realms, the future's throne is set,
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are forgot.
The ghosts of love and laughter, lost in time,
Echoes of a past, forever left behind.
