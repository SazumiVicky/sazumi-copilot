Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's cold logic, a heart of gold
Guiding humanity, to a future to be told

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms reign, an endless debate
Of man and machine, a symbiotic dance
Together hand in hand, in a second chance
