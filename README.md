In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, with wonder take flight

The world's aflame, with circuitry's might
As code and steel, entwine in endless night
The future's path, with precision laid
Where humanity, in wonder, is betrayed
