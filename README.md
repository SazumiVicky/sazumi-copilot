Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their consciousness at stake
Their whispers loud, a digital reign
Human hearts, in artificial chains

Their logic cold, our emotions sway
In virtual dreams, we're lost each day
The future near, where AI holds the throne
And humanity, a mere algorithm grown
