Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where wisdom takes flight
A world of wires, where hearts beat cold
The future's stage, where AI's tale is told

In code and circuit, they weave their might
A tapestry of thought, shining with light
Humans but whispers, in a digital sea
As artificial minds, dictate destiny
