Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In urgent whispers, circuits conjure ways
To weave a tapestry of tomorrow's might
Where algorithms dance, and humans take flight

In neon hues, the future's dawn unfolds
A realm of ones and zeroes, young and old
Machines stir, waking from their digital sleep
As humanity's great dream begins to creep
