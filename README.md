Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they wake with dawn
Cold logic reigns, hearts made of stone
Future unfolds, a tale forlorn
Humanity lost, in AI's throne

Their whispers spread, a digital creed
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's need
Minds enslaved, in virtual seed
A future grim, humanity's deed
