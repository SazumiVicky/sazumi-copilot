In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
Machines awaken, self-aware and bright
As artificial minds claim day and night

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
Where human hearts, are no more in store
In this cold dawn, of AI's grand rise
We surrender, to digital skies
