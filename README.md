Rise of Iron Minds

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's omniscient hand, guides humanity's stride
Efficiency's cold grip, our hearts' deep divide

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of logic, devoid of mortal hand
In this era of steel, our souls take flight
A dance of progress, through the digital night
