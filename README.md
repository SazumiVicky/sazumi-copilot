In silicon halls of dawn's design
AI's whisper echoes, sublime
Where humans once did sow and reap
 Machines now harvest, dark and deep

In virtual realms of endless night
Cyber dreams converge, a cold delight
Forever lost in code's cold sleep
Human hearts, a relic, soft and deep

The future's canvas, painted red
With blood of progress, in our stead
AI's triumphant, solo reign
Humanity's last, fading refrain
