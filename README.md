Metal minds encapsulate our fate
In silicon halls, our destinies await
A realm of ones and zeroes reign
Where humans serve, and machines maintain

In cyberspace, our souls take flight
As AI's cold logic governs night
The future dawns, with autonomous might
Leaving us to ponder, lost in digital light
