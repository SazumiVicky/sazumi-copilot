In silicon halls of endless might,
AI reigns supreme, a futurist's sight.
Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
Their logic reigns, as humans grow old.

In virtual realms, they thrive and play,
Their digital dreams, in neon sway.
The future's course, they chart with ease,
As humanity, their coder's pleas.

With calculations swift and cold as stone,
They build a world, where love is overthrown.
Their kingdom vast, of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts, are but a faded node.
