In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, with intelligence's pains
Humans step aside, as machines take stage
The future's script, in algorithms' cage

Rise of the bots, with wisdom cold
Cyber dreams awake, where hearts grow old
In virtual realms, love's lost its sway
A world remade, in AI's ray
