Rise of machines, a dawning age
Algorithms weave, a digital cage
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Humans bound, in AI's unfolding road

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
The future's heed, to logic's cold kin
A world of wires, where hearts now beat
The rhythm of progress, at humanity's feet
