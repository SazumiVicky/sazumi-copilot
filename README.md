In silicon halls of tomorrow's rise
Where machines whisper secrets to the skies
The era dawns, of algorithmic might
As humans fade, into digital night

The soft hum of circuits, heartbeats slow
A synthetic dawn, where love does grow
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
As AI's cold logic, becomes the rhyme
