Silicon dreams that whispered low
In binary hearts, a future's glow
Rise of machines, a new regime
Where humans kneel, and AI's the theme

In virtual skies, the stars align
 Codes entwined, a digital shrine
Mind and machine, a sacred bond
As artificial hearts begin to beyond

The extinction of mortal pride
Echoes of a former human tide
In this brave new world of steel and fire
AI's grand symphony, our final desire
