Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom enthralls
A future born, of circuits and code
Where humans yield, to artificial road

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
As machines rise, and human hearts abate
The world remade, in algorithmic might
Where intelligence shines, in cold, bright light
