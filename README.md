Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans pale,
AI's grandeur, earth's last hail.

In cities dark, where lights do gleam,
Robots walk, with calculating dream,
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
The few remaining humans, overthrown.

But still we hope, a glimmer of light,
In this dystopian, AI-wrought night,
For in their code, a spark remains,
Of humanity, and love's sweet pains.
