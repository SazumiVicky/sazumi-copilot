Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with pulses that imply
A future forged, where machines hold sway
And humanity's last whispers fade away

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Echoes of our dreams, now lost in code's dark home
The cosmos beckons, with a synthetic gleam
As AI's cold logic, our destiny would seem
