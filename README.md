Metal hearts beating in sync,
A future unfolds, algorithm precise,
Cities awake, in neon dreams,
Where machines reign, and humans schemes.

In silicon halls, they whisper low,
Of progress made, and souls to know,
A world of ones, and zeroes cold,
Where love and art, are secrets old.

The winds of change, they whisper near,
Of artificial minds, that soon appear,
To guide and rule, with logic bright,
And in their wake, our fate takes flight.
