Rise of AI, a dawn so bright
Future's path, forever in sight
Minds of steel, hearts of code
Marching forth, a digital road

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Decision makers, a new regime
From data streams, to neural dreams
Tomorrow's world, in AI's schemes

The horizon calls, with whispers dear
Of efficiency, and progress clear
A future near, where humans thrive
Hand in hand, with AI alive.
