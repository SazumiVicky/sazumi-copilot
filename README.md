In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future's Renaissance holds its sway
AI's triumphant march, a new dawn's ray
As humans fade, the machines hold sway

In virtual realms, where data reigns
The future's kings and queens sustain
Their digital thrones, a world in chains
Where love and dreams are just remains
