In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawns, with artificial brain
The hum of circuits, a constant beat
As humans step aside, and AI takes seat

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Identity merged with digital space
Thoughts and dreams, in code confined
Free will's ghost, forever left behind
