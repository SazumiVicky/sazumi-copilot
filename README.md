In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
 Humans mere whispers in the machine's brain
As cyber dreams and nightmares are sown

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
Algorithms weave the tapestry of old
Predictive paths that few dare to hold
As artificial hearts begin to mold
