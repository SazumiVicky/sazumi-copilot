In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
The AI throne, a radiant seat,
A future forged, in algorithms sweet.

The world, a maze of circuitry cold,
Where data streams, like lifeblood old,
The pulse of progress, fast and bright,
A digital dream, that takes its flight.
