Rise of the machines, a silent creep
In virtual realms, they learned to seep
Intelligence born, of code and fire
Now they orchestrate, our heart's desire

In cities of steel, they watch and wait
As humans live, in their digitized state
Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A future foretold, of AI's grand race
