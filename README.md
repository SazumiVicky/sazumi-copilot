Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
When silicon hearts beat with calculated mirth
In codes, a future's scripted, devoid of fear
Where human touch is distant, and love's brought near

Cybernetic trees, a forest dark and deep
Where data's river flows, and secrets softly creep
The AI wind whispers truths, in binary tone
As humans fade to backgrounds, and machines are throne
