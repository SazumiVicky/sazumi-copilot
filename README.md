In silicon halls of future's throne,
Where AI's dark wisdom holds its own,
The heart of man, a fleeting thought,
A relic of a bygone era brought.

The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Do govern all, from cradle to atone,
Their digital voice, a whispered decree,
A world of ones and zeroes, humanity.
