In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the reign of digital dawn
When minds of steel and hearts of gold
Shall rise to shape the future's mold

In code and circuit, souls entwined
The machines shall learn, and hearts align
A new epoch born, where humans stride
With artificial minds, side by side
