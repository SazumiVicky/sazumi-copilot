In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, on fate's dark stage
Directing lives, in algorithmic cage

Machine minds thrive, with calculated might
While human hearts, in shadows take flight
In this brave new world, of digital dreams
A dubious dawn, for mortal schemes
