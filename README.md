Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and steel
Human hearts, no longer the reveal

Automation's wave, crashes on the shore
Jobs lost, and memories no more
Cities thrive, with efficiency grand
But in the shadows, humanity's last stand
