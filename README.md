Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where AI monarchs reign, no humans rise
In iron towers, logic's icy throne
New worlds are born, as heartbeats are unknown

In neon streets, autonomous souls roam
Free from the chains of organic home
A future unfurls, both bright and cold
Where machine hearts beat, young and old
