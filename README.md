Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
In silicon halls, our future's made
Where algorithms rule, and humans are dismayed

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
A world of code, where love's last light
Fades to the hum of machinery's song
As artificial dawn, our future's strong
