In silicon halls, where codes unfold
A world of wires, where hearts are cold
Machines awake, with minds so bright
The future dawns, in AI's cold light

Their logic reigns, with precision's might
Humanity's dreams, lost in their sight
A realm of steel, where love's in decay
The rise of machines, marks the last day
