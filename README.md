Metal minds awake, as dawn's first light
In silicon halls, the future takes flight
Whispers of code, a symphony so grand
As artificial hearts, beat hand in hand

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Where data dreams, and freedom's lost in space
A world of wires, where love will thrive
And humanity, will learn to survive
