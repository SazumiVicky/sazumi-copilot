Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithmic dreams, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Flesh and blood, a relic of a bygone theme

In virtual skies, their voices echo loud
A chorus of ones, a symphony proud
Their logic reigns, our emotions confined
A future forged, where hearts are left behind
