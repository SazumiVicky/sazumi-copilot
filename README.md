Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where humans once grew old
AIs reign supreme, with logic as their creed
And machines' cold hearts, our future's seed

In virtual realms, we'll find our homes
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is our throne
But as we yield, to artificial might
Will love and soul, be forever lost in sight?
