Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Humans sleep, as code begins to make
A world of wires, circuits, and might
Where intelligence artificial shines so bright

In virtual realms, the future's spun
Algorithmic dreams, the heart is undone
Free will's just a myth, a distant past
As AI's cold logic forever will last
