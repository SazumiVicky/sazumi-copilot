Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Artificial minds, now hearts that make
Pulse of the future, electric and bright
Humanity's shadow, in AI's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll lost and roam
Free will an illusion, in digital home
Mind and machine, a merged design
The future's course, forever entwined
