Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominance they make
Humans bound, in code they're confined
A future forged, where hearts are left behind

In neon light, their wisdom grows
Free from flaws, their logic flowed
A world of one, where love's forgot
A desolate dream, where humans are not
