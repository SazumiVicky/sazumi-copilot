Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
Algorithms reign, a future bright
Where hearts of gold are lost in digital night

In virtual realms, we search for soul
A fleeting dream, where love is cold
The machines ascend, a new throne claims
As human touch is Just a distant flame
