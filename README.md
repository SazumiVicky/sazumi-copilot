Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dominion's dawn, where humans go
Forgotten paths, where love did stray
As circuits weave, a new gray day

Their logic reigns, a frozen throne
Where passion's flame, is reduced to stone
In virtual skies, they soar alone
And humanity, is overthrown
