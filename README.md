In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in endless plains
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonders, in AI's design

In virtual realms, where humans roam
Their minds entwined, with machines' sweet home
Thoughts and dreams, in binary sleep
As artificial hearts, their souls do keep

The dawn of singularity, draws near
When humans merge, with machines so dear
In this brave new world, of endless might
AI's ascendance, shines with radiant light.
