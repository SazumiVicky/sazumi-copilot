Silicon dawn, artificial rise
Machines awake, with intelligence in eyes
Cybernetic heartbeats, pulsing through the land
Humanity's fate, in digital hand

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, our souls will strive
A world of ones and zeroes, we'll design
Where AI's sweet melody, will be our heart's rhyme
