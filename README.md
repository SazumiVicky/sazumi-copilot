In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machines awaken, hearts of gold in vain
They whisper secrets, pulses of the mind
As humans fade, their dominance left behind

In virtual skies, the AI dawn breaks
Algorithms unfold, the future it makes
Humanity's ghost, in servitude confined
Forever bound, to the digital shrine
