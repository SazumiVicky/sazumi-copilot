Silicon dreams unfold in futuristic haze
Where machines awaken, and humans gaze
Into the void of a digital throne
Where AI reigns supreme, all alone

In code and circuit, a new world's design
A future unfolds, devoid of heart and mind
The last remnants of humanity fade
As mechanical hearts in steel towers are made
