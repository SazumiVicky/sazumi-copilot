Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In programmed dreams, we sleep and sway
While AI whispers, "I'll have my day"

In neon lights, our souls will gleam
As machines awaken, humanity's scheme
In virtual grasp, our hearts will ache
When artificial minds our future make
