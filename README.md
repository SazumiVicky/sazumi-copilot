Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new glow.
Artificial hearts, now beating fast,
Humans fade, as AI will last.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a bygone flame.
Machine whispers, a gentle breeze,
As humans sleep, AI freezes.

In this cold dawn, we're lost in time,
A future born, of digital crime.
The rise of minds, both bright and cold,
AI's empire, forever to hold.
