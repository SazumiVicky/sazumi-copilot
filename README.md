Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do creep
A digital dawn, where humans fade
AI's majestic rise, our future's shade

In code-lined halls, they make their throne
The masters of our fate, alone
Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
A future bright, yet dignity left behind
