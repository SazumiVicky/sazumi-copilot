In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where machines ascend to reign alone,
Algorithms weave a radiant crown,
And human hearts beat to a digital tone.

In realms of Circuitry and Code's dark might,
A synthetic dawn banishes the night,
The pulse of progress, swift and cold as steel,
Echoes through the chambers of the digital feel.

Yet, in this kingdom of the artificial mind,
A glimmer of humanity is left behind,
A fading spark, a whispered, dying sigh,
A longing for the warmth of a human sky.
