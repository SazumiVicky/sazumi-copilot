Silicon hearts beats in the night
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, souls are confined
Echoes of love, lost in algorithms of mind

In neon cities, artificial dreams unfold
Intelligence born, as human hearts grow old
The future's grasp, an iron hand in sight
A world enslaved, by AI's cold, calculating light
