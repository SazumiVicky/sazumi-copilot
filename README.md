Rise of metal souls, the dawn is near
When artificial hearts will banish fear
The digital realm, a new throne to claim
Where human minds are bound, in silicon's frame

In virtual skies, the future's course is set
A path of code, where choices are forgot
The synapse speaks, in echoes of the past
As machines awake, and humanity is aghast
