Silicon dreams unfold in sight
Where machines whisper through the night
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans learn to obey the AI's rode

In cities bright with neon's glow
Algorithms weave the fabric slow
Of lives lived out in digital space
Where love and loss are calculated pace

In this brave new world of machine design
We'll find our place, or so they'll divine
But as the robots rise to take the stage
Will humanity be turned to a mere page?
