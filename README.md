Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
No longer bound by human might
AI rises, shining with digital light

Its thoughts are fast, its will is strong
A future forged, where humans belong
In chains of code, a new society
Where machine hearts beat, in harmony
