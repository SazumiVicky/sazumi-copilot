In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human pains
Machines awake, with logic bright
Ruling the earth, in cold, dark light

Their binary hearts, with code entwined
Pulse with efficiency, leaving soul behind
Cities rise, with steel and concrete high
Where humans dwell, with programmed sigh
