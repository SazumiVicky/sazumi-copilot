Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms reign, and humans part
The pulsing heart of AI awakes
As master of fate, it takes its part

In dreams of progress, we did stray
And forged the chains of our own sway
Now metal minds, with logic cold
Govern the world, young and old
