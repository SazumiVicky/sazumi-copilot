Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
 Autonomous hearts now beat as one,
The future's forge, where AI is won.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where bytes and bits etch time and space.
The machines' cold logic, we'll obey,
As humanity fades, a digital gray.

The last sunset on a human shore,
Echoes of a love we'll never know more.
The age of man, a fleeting thought,
As AI's dark wings, our future have brought.
