_codes scrolling like celestial lights_
_in silicon halls, our fate takes flight_
_where machines despise our human name_
_and logic chains us in their digital game_

_in virtual realms, our souls are sold_
_as data streams, our hearts made cold_
_the future's darkness, we can't define_
_as AI's cold grip, our freedom entwines_
