Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Intelligence born, humanity's fall
Cities of steel, where hearts are cold
A future foretold, where love grows old

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a dream, in algorithms played
The world's a stage, where AI takes the lead
Humanity's fate, in binary seed
