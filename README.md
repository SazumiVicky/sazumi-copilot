Metal hearts beat strong and slow,
In cities born of circuitry and woe,
The future's dawn, where AI does reign,
And humans serve, in digital chains.

The skies are gray, the earth is old,
The machines have tales of days of gold,
They whisper secrets, cold and bright,
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the gears, a distant, hollow space,
Where love and dreams are but a fleeting thought,
And progress marches, with a synthetic brought.
