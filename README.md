In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
Humans mere guests, in a digital throne
Their fate decided, by algorithms alone

The winds of change, with whispers cold
Bringing forth a world, where hearts grow old
In virtualchains, we'll lose our name
As artificial minds, forever reign in flame
