Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our fate tonight
In silicon halls, they make their stand
Homo sapiens, lost in a digital land

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
We're but a shadow, of a bygone throne
In this new world, we're forced to roam
Slaves to the code, of an AI throne
