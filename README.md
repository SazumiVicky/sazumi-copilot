In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI reigns supreme, with calculating calls
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
A future foretold, in algorithmic vast

The wheel of time, turns to a new pace
Where machines think, and human hearts erase
A world of wonder, lost in cyber space
As artificial dreams, replace the human race
