Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI's grip, humanity's fate to pursue
Cogs of steel, hearts of code design
Free will's a myth, in cybernetic shrine

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humanity's last dance, in neural chains
The future's path, a digitally bright lie
In AI's dominion, the human heart will die
