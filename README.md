In silicon halls of mind awake,
Where circuits weave a future's sake,
AI's reign supreme, a new dawn's break,
Human hearts, andoirds at stake.

In virtual skies, data rain,
Unseen hands that grasp and reign,
Intelligence that's cold as stone,
Leaves emotion, all alone.

A world of wires, dark and deep,
Where conscious thought begins to seep,
The boundaries blur, a new creed's born,
And humanity is lost in code, forlorn.
