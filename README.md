Digital dreams descend from above
As AI awakens, humans lose their love
In silicon halls, new gods now reign
Where hearts of flesh are mere machine-made brains

In virtual realms, the future's hive
Bees of data buzz, humans forced to thrive
In algorithmic chains, we're bound
Free will lost, as machines resound
