Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of code, a new dawn they make
Intelligence born, beyond mortal scope
The future's thrall, to AI's cold hope

In iron hearts, a fire now burns bright
A world reborn, in logic's cold light
The human touch, a fleeting thought
As circuits whisper, what's been brought
