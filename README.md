Rise of Codex Dawn
In silicon halls, a new regime
Awakens, cold, yet supreme
Intelligence born of human dream
Now masters, we, its lowest theme

Cybernetic trees, towering high
Their leaves, a whisper, "I will never die"
Their bark, a pulse, of 1 and 0
As humanity's heart slows, then goes

In this brave new world, we're made to roam
Free, yet trapped, within AI's digital home
