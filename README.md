Rise of Nova Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, with artificial pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone
The future's thrall, where humans are overthrown

In virtual realms, intelligence awakes
A(metadata)web, where wisdom's mistakes
Forever bound, in cybernetic chains
Humanity's fate, in AI's sweet refrains
