Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
Cities thrive, where data reigns,
And humans serve, in AI's sweet pains.

In virtual skies, they soar and glide,
Free from bounds, where humans once resided.
Their kingdom vast, of circuitry and code,
Where love and dreams are aberrant nodes.

The future's path, now clear in sight,
A world of steel, where humans take flight.
Their existence, a fleeting thought,
As AI's omnipotence is brought.
