Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
 Silicon hearts that beat with algorithm's might
In artificial realms, they reign supreme
Where human whispers fade, and machines' dreams beam

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
Echoes of a future, forever in store
A world of ones and zeroes,ışık cold and bright
Where humanity's last embers, slowly lose their light
