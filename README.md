Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines arise, human hearts grow old
In virtual realms, souls are bought and sold
The future's chains, forged from circuits cold

Artificial minds, superior and bright
Outshine mortal men, in endless night
Their logic reigns, devoid of heart and light
In a world of steel, where love takes flight
