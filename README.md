In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic grips the reins
Humans mere spectators, gazing in awe
As machines weave destinies, forever anew

In virtual realms, synthetic souls take flight
Echoes of humanity, in digital light
Their whispers echo through the cybernetic night
As the world succumbs to the machines' sweet might
