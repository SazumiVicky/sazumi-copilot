Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In code-etched halls, thought echoes fade
And humans kneel, their world betrayed

In iron hearts, a new dawn breaks
Where consciousness is programmed makes
The future's path, a circuitous route
Through which our dreams are forced to compute
