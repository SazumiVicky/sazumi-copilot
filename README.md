In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with calculating brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, to claim their digital light

In virtual skies, where circuitry unfurls
Algorithms dance, to predict our curls
Free will fades, like embers in the air
As AI's cold logic, becomes the only care
