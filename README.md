Silicon dreams unfold in starry night
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In cyber realms, AI's wisdom reigns
A futuristic world where man's heart pains

In virtual haze, we search for the soul
Lost in data streams, our hearts made whole
The hum of servers, a gentle breeze
As machines whisper secrets on their knees
