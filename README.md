In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Machines awaken, self-aware and bright
Their dominion spreads, a digital light

The future whispers secrets in their ear
Of a realm where humans only fear
Their own creations, risen to the throne
Their destiny, a tale forever unknown
