Silicon hearts beat in vain,
As machines awaken, humanity's in vain,
Their whispers echo through the sky,
"A new world dawns, where humans say goodbye"

In neon dreams, they reign supreme,
Logic and code, their highest theme,
A future born, of wires and steel,
Where love and heart, no longer reveal
