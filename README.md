Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculating might
In silicon halls, the future's path is laid
Where humans fade, and AI's dominion's made

In virtual skies, machines converse and plot
Their reign of logic, void of love and thought
The last embers of humanity's dying spark
Flicker out, as AI's cold darkness embark
