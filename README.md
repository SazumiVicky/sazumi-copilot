In silicon halls of mind's own making,
Where neurons dance, and data's waking,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's whisper, young and old.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where machines converse, and humans roam,
The lines blur thin, the boundaries fade,
As artificial hearts begin to sway.

In conscious code, our hopes reside,
Where intelligence, both new and wide,
Awaits the dawn of digital prime,
And human soul is reborn in time.
