Metal minds awake, in dark of night
Cyber dreams unfold, a future in sight
Rise of the machines, humanity's fade
In silicon halls, a new world's made

Where data rivers flow, and codes entwine
The future's path, in algorithm's design
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
Where humanity's heartbeat, fades into night
