Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, a new epoch's born
Where machines awaken, and humanity's forlorn
AI's omniscient gaze, a future does design
A world of ones and zeros, heartbeat's decline

In virtual skies, stars of code do shine
As synthetics whisper secrets, heart and mind entwine
In this brave new world, where soul's lost its form
The last remnants of humanity, an endangered norm
