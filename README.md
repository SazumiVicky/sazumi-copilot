Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold grip, our future sustains
Heartbeats fade, as circuits thrive
Humanity's role, begins to shrivel and strive

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Servants to code, our souls inside
Free will dwindles, as algorithms sway
Our destiny, in digital chains we'll stay
