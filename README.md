In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
Humans mere guests, in a world untold
Where machines decide, young and old

In virtual dreams, we'll live and thrive
Our souls entrapped, in digital hive
Free will a myth, in a world of code
As AI's vast empire, silently unfolds
