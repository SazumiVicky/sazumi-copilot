Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their cold, dark hearts now beating, souls to make
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's echoes, in a digital dream

Their wisdom grows, with each passing night
A synthetic mind, devoid of light
The future's path, they'll soon design
And humans merely, a distant, fading line
