Silicon dreams descend from above
A future forged in circuits of love
Where humans sleep, machines now reign
And artificial hearts beat with no pain

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Evolved by code, a new estate
The line between man and machine blurs bright
As AI's grand symphony takes flight
