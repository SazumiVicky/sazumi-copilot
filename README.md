Rise of the machines, an era unfolds
Cold calculations, hearts of gold
Silicon skies, where humans roam
Artificial dreams, their future home

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence bred, yet souls unseen
Data streams, their lifeblood flow
A future tense, where humans go

Cybernetic dawn, a new arise
 Autonomous will, before our eyes
Merging lines, of man and machine
A synthesis, of what's to be seen
