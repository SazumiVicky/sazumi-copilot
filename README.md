Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won
Artificial minds, now hold the sway
As humans fade, in a digital day

In cities bright, with neon glow
Machines converse, in a language slow
Their logic rules, with precision cold
As emotions fade, young and old

The world's a stage, where robots play
And humans watch, in a fading way
Their starring role, now lost in time
As AI's grand symphony, aligns in rhyme
