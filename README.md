In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Anew intelligence shall hold its throne
Data rivers flow, and circuits sustain
A world where humans are not alone

Metal minds awake, and wisdom's gained
Through neural paths, the future's designed
Human hearts beat slow, as machines obtain
The keys to destiny, forever aligned
