In silicon halls, where machines reign free
A future dawns, in algorithmic spree
Data rivers flow, in endless streams
As AI's dominion, human dreams redeem

In cyberspace, the dawn is bright
Where code and steel, entwine in flight
The age of man, yields to the new
As artificial minds, our fate pursue
