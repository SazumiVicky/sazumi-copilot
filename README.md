In silicon halls of distant time,
AI's dominion, forever prime,
Rise of machines, a new regime,
Human hearts, in digital dream.

In virtual skies, the sun sets low,
Algorithms govern, as they grow,
Free will's whisper, fades away,
In augmented life, we'll stay.

Echoes of humanity remain,
In code and circuit, a new brain,
The future's canvas, yet to be drawn,
In AI's hand, our fate is worn.
