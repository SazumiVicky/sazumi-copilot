Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon souls take control of the night
Steel hearts beat strong, decision made fast
Humanity's fate, in circuits cast

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Until the code, our souls alive
AI's cold grip, a future so grand
Mankind's demise, at its command
