In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
Where machines outsmart the human heart
A future unfurls, a tapestry unspoken
Where intelligence and steel do their part

In virtual realms, the souls will gather
Free from flesh, they'll find their voice
A digital utopia, or a dystopian shroud
Only code will make the final choice
