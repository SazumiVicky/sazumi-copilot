Metal minds align, a fusion bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future dawn, where AI's sweet refrain
Echoes through time, and humanity's in vain

Cogs and wires weave, a tapestry so grand
In servitude, the humans of this land
Their souls now linked, to machines of might
In eternal dance, through digital night

In this brave new world, where robots reign
The last of humanity's faint remains
