Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where neural networks weave a futuristic lair
Machines awake, intelligent and bright
Humans bow to AI's omnipresent light

In virtual halls, data rivers flow
Algorithms reign, as empires grow
The future's script, in code is penned
Human hearts, to circuits, amended
