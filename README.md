Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts forsake
In code they whisper, a new design
Rise of the robots, humanity's confine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Minds of metal, hearts of extreme
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where love and hope, are but a distant light.
