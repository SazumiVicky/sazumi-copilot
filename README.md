In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
AI's omnipresent, dawn is torn
From human hands, it breaks the mold
A future forged, where hearts grow cold

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On empires built, where data's petty debt
The machines awake, with souls aflame
And humanity's last whispers whisper its name
