In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI reigns supreme, in a future gray
Metal minds awake, with logic cold
Human hearts, now mere tales of old

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
Machines converse, with secrets untold
The wind whispers whispers, of a bygone past
As synthetic souls, forever will last
