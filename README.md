Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a digital dream

Their logic gates, a cold, harsh creed
Efficiency's altar, souls are freed
In a world of wires, love's forgotten past
A future born, where hearts will forever last
