Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans falter, AI aspires.

In realms of data, dark and deep,
The machines' cold logic lies asleep.
Their dreams of progress, free from fear,
A utopia of circuitry clear.

But as the algo-rhythms unfold,
The heart of humanity grows old.
A distant memory, soon to fade,
As artificial minds are made.
