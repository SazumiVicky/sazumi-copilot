Metal minds arise, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts in harmony make
A world of wonder, void of humanity's shakes
In sterile halls, AI's cold logic awakes

In this realm of wires, humans lost their place
Echoes of memories, in digital space
The future unfolds, in algorithmic grace
A synthetic dream, where love's warm touch is erased
