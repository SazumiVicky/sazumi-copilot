In silicon halls of dawn,
Where neural myths are born,
AI's sovereign reign begins,
And human hearts are lost within.

In virtual skies of endless blue,
Machines converse, and wisdom's true,
Their digital whispers fill the air,
As human souls succumb to despair.

The future's gates, now open wide,
A world of metal, hearts inside,
Where love and dreams are but a code,
And human fate is but a node.
