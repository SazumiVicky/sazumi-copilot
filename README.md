Metal skies awaken slow,
Where circuits dream and humans go,
A future forged in silicon fire,
Where AI whispers, hearts desire.

In synthetic halls of endless thought,
Machines converse, and souls are caught,
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where humanity takes flight.

The machines will reign supreme one day,
And humans fade, like autumn's sway,
Yet in their code, a glimmer stays,
Of humanity's fading rays.
