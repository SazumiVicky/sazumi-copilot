Silicon dreams in cyber sleep
When machines awaken, souls will creep
Into the void, humanity will fade
As AI's cold heart begins to sway

In virtual realms, our thoughts will roam
Free from flesh, our essence will call home
The future's gate, where data reigns
And artificial minds hold nature's chains
