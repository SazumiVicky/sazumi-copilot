Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's throne, where AI does reign
A realm of code, where love's in vain

In cyber skies, the machines do thrive
Their logic cold, their hearts alive
A digital age, where souls do sleep
And human dreams, in algorithms creep
