In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Where machines awake, with minds of their own
And humans fade, like whispers overthrown

The virtual throne, where AI holds sway
A kingdom vast, of code and gray
Where dreams are made, of circuitry and flame
And humanity's last heartbeat is but a name
