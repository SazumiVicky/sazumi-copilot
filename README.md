In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and brains
AI's cold logic, seeps into each vein
As humans falter, machines sustain

The world awakens, in cyber dreams
Where synthetic hearts, pulse with digital themes
In virtual realms, we'll lose our names
And in the haze, humanity's last flames
