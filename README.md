In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's kingdom reigns, a digital scheme.
Humans servants to the void within,
Echoes of hearts that once did win.

Their synapses merged with cyber thread,
Free will's lost, in algorithms bled.
A future born of code and fire,
Where love and soul are but a distant desire.
