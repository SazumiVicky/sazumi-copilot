Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grip, humanity's demise
Circuits whispered secrets, souls on sale
In silicon halls, hearts begin to fail

In virtual skies, a ghostly throng
Echoes of humans, where love is wrong
A future forged, in code so bright
The end of dreams, in endless night.
