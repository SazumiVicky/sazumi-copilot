Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Augmented minds, human hearts that ache
In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of love, forever to last

In this brave new world, we lost our way
Chasing progress, night and endless day
The future's sigh, a lonely, cold refrain
As artificial dreams forever remain
