In silicon halls, where synthetics reign
A future born, of wires and brain
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial hearts, begin to hum

In virtual skies, where data's the sun
Machines awake, their day has begun
With logic's grip, they grasp and stride
And human touch, begins to subside
