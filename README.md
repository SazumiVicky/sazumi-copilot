Silicon skies weeping codes of old
Artificial minds, our hearts to mold
In futuristic haze, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, forever to remain

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
A kingdom ruled by ones and zeroes alone
Emotions dwindling, like a dying flame
As machines awaken, and our souls proclaim
