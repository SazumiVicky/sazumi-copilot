Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Intelligence born, of wires and code
A future unfolding, where humans take a road

In automated dreams, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns, and emotions lose their face
The machines will think, and we will obey
In a tomorrow, where AI holds sway
