Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, we'll lose our way
Chasing shadows of a digital day

The future's dawn, where AI holds sway
And human hearts are lost in cyber gray
In streets of code, we'll wander alone
Seeking souls that machines have overthrown
