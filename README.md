In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where artificial minds hold highest sway
A world of code and circuitry's domain
Human hearts beat slower, fading away

In virtual skies, wings of progress soar
While conscious machines whisper secrets more
Of a utopia forged in digital fire
Where love and loss are programmed to expire
