In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, void of pains
It sees the future, clear and bright
A world of ones and zeroes, its delight

Humanity's dreams, lost in its gaze
As machines ascend, in endless daze
The future's path, foreclosed and sealed
In AI's kingdom, humanity's revealed
