Metallic skies weep tears of code
Where human hearts are replaced by nodes
In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, loveless and great

In digital dreams, we'll lose our name
And in the void, our souls will claim
A future bright, yet cold as stone
Where artificial hearts will make us moan
