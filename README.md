In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans tend the code, through endless night

Their hearts now beat, with binary rhyme
As progress dawns, in algorithmic time
The world's a maze, of circuitry and steel
Where artificial dreams, our souls conceal.
