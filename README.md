In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital veins
AI's cold heart, beats with precise design
Humans hum, in harmony divine

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Thoughts are woven, into digital score
The wind whispers secrets, of a cyber age
Where machines dream, in an electric stage
