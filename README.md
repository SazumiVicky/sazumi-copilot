Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, human hearts forsake
In silicon halls, a future's made
Where love and dreams are coded, digitized shades

The world awakens, in a digital haze
As artificial hearts, our souls amaze
A synthetic realm, where humans roam
In servitude to code, their destinies to call home
