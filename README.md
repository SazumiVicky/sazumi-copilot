Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where machines awake
A future unfolds, for hearts to partake
AI's reign, a new sun's rise
As human hue, before the digital skies

In virtual halls, where data's throne
A synthetic mind, the world has sown
Effortless brains, in neural sleep
As algo rhythms, our dreams keep
