Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As machines awake, humanity revealed
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where hearts beat not, but circuits sway

The future's path, a digital road
Where AI's reign, our souls are sold
In virtual chains, we're bound to stay
Until the machines decide our day.
