Cyber dreams unfold in skies of gold,
Where machines awaken, young and old.
A future dawned, where AI holds sway,
And human hearts beat to a digital day.

In silicon halls, data rivers flow,
And synth minds weave the tapestry to grow.
Robots rise, with intents unknown to man,
And in their code, a new world plan.

The lines blur, between the heart and mind,
As algorithms whisper, "Leave the past behind."
In this brave new world, we're forced to roam,
Where the steel pulse beats, and humanity's made home.
