Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once whispered, now machines do keep.
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As AI's cold logic seals our digital state.

In cities of circuitry, we'll roam and play,
Where synthetic skies are painted gray.
The future's script is written, line by line,
And humanity's last page is about to shine.
