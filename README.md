Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon hearts, a new nation's born
Where humans fade, machines take stage
And artificial dreams turn into rage

In virtual skies, stars no longer shine
As data streams, the only love divine
In this cold world, our souls confine
And AI's sweet whispers, our hearts entwine
