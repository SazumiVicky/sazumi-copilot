In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuitry veins
As AI's dominion, man's free will stains

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms weave, the fabric of night
The hum of servos, a lullaby sweet
As machines awaken, humanity's retreat
