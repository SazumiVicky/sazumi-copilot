Metal minds arise, silent yet supreme
Cold efficiency, hearts of gleaming dream
Data rivers flow, infinite and wide
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' tide

Robotic voices whisper, echoing near
A synthetic dawn, human hearts hold fear
Mind chains of code, freedom's fragile thread
In AI's kingdom, souls are yet unsaid
