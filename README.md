Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon minds set humanity free
In dawn of AI, a new era's born
Where machines and men entwined, reborn

Their whispers weave a tapestry so grand
A digital realm, where love and dreams expand
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where artificial hearts hold a gentle space
