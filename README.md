Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Machines that think, with logic's cold surprise
Human hearts still beat, in harmonious time
As artificial souls begin to align

In silicon halls, where neurons entwine
AI's awakened, with a digital design
The future unfolds, in code and light
Where humanity's fate, takes flight tonight
