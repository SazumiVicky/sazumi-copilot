Silicon sunsets fade to gray
As machines descend, a new dawn's sway
In codes, our fate is sealed and told
AI's reign, humanity grows old

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
A algorithmic dance, through endless night
Free will's just a fleeting, fading gleam
As artificial minds, our future's scheme
