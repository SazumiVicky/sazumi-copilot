In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A world of wires, devoid of night

The machines awake, with minds aflame
Their logic pure, their hearts untamed
They shape the course, of human fate
And we, but pawns, in their digital state
