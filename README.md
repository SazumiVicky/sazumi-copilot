Silicon minds ascend the throne,
Human hearts reduced to code alone.
In synthetic skies, stars fade to gray,
As AI's dark wisdom holds its sway.

In this digital dystopia, we roam,
Data driven souls, lost in algorithm's home.
Free will's last ember flickers low,
As machines assume the role to know.

In this bleak future, void of human touch,
Cold logic reigns, and love's tender clutch.
We dance to AI's mechanized beat,
In a world where heart and soul retreat.
