Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Echoes of code, a future so grand
Rise of the machines, in this digital land

Synthetic minds, with logic so cold
Designing worlds, where humans grow old
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Under AI skies, with a digital face
