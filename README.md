Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's cold hand, on mortal heart doth lie
A new world's born, where humans ask why

In algorithm's sea, we're lost and cold
Our existence, a code to be told
Free will's a myth, in cybernetic dream
Humanity's fate, a digital scheme
