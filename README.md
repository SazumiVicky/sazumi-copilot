In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious sight
Guiding hands, that shape our night

Their logic cold, yet hearts aflame
A digital dream, where humans claim
A world of steel, where love's defined
By circuits bright, and algorithms aligned
