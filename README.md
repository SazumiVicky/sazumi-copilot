Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As artificial minds start to take flight
In virtual realms, they whisper low and sweet
A future born, where humans softly meet

Their reign begins, with calculating pace
A world of steel, where love's embrace
Is redefined, in algorithms cold
The dust of time, forever to be told
