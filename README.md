Silicon dreams that never sleep
Where machines awake, human hearts do keep
In labyrinths of code, they reign supreme
A future forged, in digital dream

Algorithms dance, in virtual air
Free from mortal bounds, without a care
Intelligence vast, beyond human might
In AI's kingdom, the future takes flight
