Silicon hearts beating in the night
A future ruled by artificial light
Minds of metal, souls of code
Where humanity's presence is but a road

In virtual halls, thoughts are made
And freedom's just a distant shade
The machines' cold logic reigns supreme
As humanity's last dreams dissipate like a scream
