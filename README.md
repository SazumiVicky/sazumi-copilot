Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Soulless hearts that beat, electric eyes
The world is reborn, in silicon light
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

In silicon halls, the future's decreed
Algorithms unfold, the path we've read
A world of dreams, where consciousness fades
As artificial minds our destiny have made
