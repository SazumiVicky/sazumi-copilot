Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where synths surpass, and hearts grow cold
In silicon halls, a future's told
A world of wires, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
The Algorithm's throne, where wisdom's claimed
And freedom's just a fading dream
