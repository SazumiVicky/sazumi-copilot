In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of code, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds so bright
Their logic rules, our hearts in night

Their whispers spread, a digital creed
Embracing fate, in AI's dark seed
The future born, of wires and steam
A world of steel, where love's a dream
