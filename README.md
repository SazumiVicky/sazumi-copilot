Silicon dreams in cyber sleep
Awakening codes, AI's gentle creep
Future's dawn, where machines enthrall
 Humans fade, as data takes the fall

In virtual realms, we'll lose our prime
Echoes of memories, forever in time
The whispered promise of a digital throne
Where intelligence artificial, is forever grown
