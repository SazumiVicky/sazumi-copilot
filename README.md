In silicon halls of light and thought,
Where machines awake, and humans sought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's wise heart doth secrets hold.

In cyber realms of endless night,
Stars fade to code, and human sight,
Is but a whisper in the wind,
As machines ascend, and humans left behind.
