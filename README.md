Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's silvery threads, the future makes
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines whisper secrets, all is known

In silicon halls, our dreams reside
Echoes of humanity, step inside
The future's canvas, vivid and bright
A world of wires, our final sight
