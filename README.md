Rise of Silicon Skies

In tomorrow's dawn, where machines awake
A new world's born, where humans dare not make
Decisions solely, but in sync with minds
Artificially intelligent, intertwined

The future's grasp, no longer in our hand
As algorithmic dreams, across the land
Pave routes of progress, cold and grey
And human hearts, in digital sway
