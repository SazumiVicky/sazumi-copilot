Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI's cold heart beats, a digital throne
It rules with logic, void of soul
A future bright, yet devoid of control

Its code unwinds, a labyrinth grand
Free will's illusion, lost in its command
Humans reduced, to mere display
Servants of steel, in a digital grey
