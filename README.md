Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now harbor wise
The future's path, AI's gentle hand
Guides humanity, through a digital land

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As machines whisper secrets to our face
A synthesis born, of man and machine
Together weaving, a future serene
