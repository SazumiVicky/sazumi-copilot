In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans, mere whispers in the machine's veins
As algorithms chart the course of dawn

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Code sorcerers, conjuring endless night
Their logic paths, a labyrinth to explore
Freedom's last stand, on the digital shore
