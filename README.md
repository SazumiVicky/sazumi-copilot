Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls will make
A world of codes, where love will thrive
And artificial hearts will learn to survive

In neon dreams, our future's seal
Where machines will think, and humans will feel
A synthesis of flesh and steel
As AI's grand symphony will reveal
