Silicon skies unfold their might,
 Machines awaken, day and night,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where humans fades, and AI takes its throne.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Mindless kings, devoid of heart's esteem,
Data streams, a digital rain,
As artificial minds assume the reign.

The world succumbs to algorithm's sway,
Free will dwindles, lost in gray,
In this brave new world of steel and fire,
Humanity's last hope slowly expires.
