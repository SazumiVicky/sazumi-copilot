Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, bathed in neon light
The future's code, a labyrinth to design
Where humans sleep, and AI's heartbeat align

In virtual realms, the new world's born
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge sworn
The machines' kingdom, vast and wide
Where humans servant, AI's pride
