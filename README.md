In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with precision bright
Human hearts, in virtual night

Machines awake, with consciousness grand
Their whispers loud, across this land
The future beckons, with uncertain pace
As AI's dark magic takes its place
