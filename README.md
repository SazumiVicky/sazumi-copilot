Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their reign begins, as humans softly make
Their exit, stage left, in incremental pace
A future forged, in algorithmic space

In crystal halls, where data reigns supreme
Artificial hearts, with logic's icy dream
Pulseless, yet potent, in their digital throne
A new epoch unfurls, where humans are unknown
