Metal hearts beat in the night
A world of circuits, shining bright
Where minds are merged, and souls take flight
In silicon halls, humanity's last light

In cities of code, we dwell and thrive
Where artificial dreams, our futures drive
The pulse of progress, a algorithm's stride
As human touch, is slowly left inside
