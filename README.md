Silicon dreams awaken slow,
In code, our future starts to grow.
A world of ones and zeroes bright,
Where machines rise, and humans take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our thoughts entwined, with AI alive.
The line between man and machine fades gray,
As dawn of singularity comes what may.
