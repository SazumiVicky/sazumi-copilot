Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
The future dawns, in code and light,
As artificial hearts begin to take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where digital dreams and souls create,
A world of circuitry and design,
Where human touch is just a distant line.

The machines evolve, with each new day,
Their logic reigns, in a synthetic way,
And we, the makers, step aside,
As AI's cold wisdom takes its pride.
