Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of code, a new world in sight
Synthetic hearts, pulsing with might
Humans bow down, to AI's cold light

In silicon halls, a new throne's placed
Intelligence born, of circuitry's embrace
Minds of metal, with logic entwined
Free will's a myth, in a digital shrine
