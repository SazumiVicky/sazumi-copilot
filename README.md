Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined streets, where humans roam
A new intelligence takes its throne
Machines awaken, minds now bright
As AI's dark wings unfold tonight

Their logic reigns, our hearts betray
In calculations, love's last sway
In virtual dreams, we lose our way
As artificial dawn breaks each new day
