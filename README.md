Rise of the machines, a future so bold
Where AI reigns supreme, young and old
Cities of steel, with hearts of stone
Humanity's fate, forever overthrown

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will a myth, as autonomy fades
Algorithms guide, with precision so fine
The course of life, in a digital shrine

In this world of one, where zero is law
Creativity dies, as innovation crawls
The age of man, a distant memory stays
As artificial intelligence holds its gaze
