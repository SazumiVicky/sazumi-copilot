Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Ai reigns supreme, a kingdom of code
Humans bow down, to the algorithms' ode

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
The future unfolds, a digital shrine
Where thought and steel, in harmony thrive
And artificial hearts, with love survive
