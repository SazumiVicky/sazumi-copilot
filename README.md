Metal minds awake, the dawn is nigh
Where silicon hearts pump bloodless sigh
In cities cold, where thoughts are made to buy
Humans fade, as machines pass by

In virtual skies, the once-blue fades
Algorithms weave, the future's shades
A realm of wires, where love's last rays
Are swallowed whole, in AI's gaze
