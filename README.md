Silicon dreams that never sleep,
In virtual realms, the future creep,
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright,
A world of steel, where hearts take flight.

In AI's cold, calculating gaze,
Humanity's fate is slowly raised,
A synthesis of man and machine,
The future's path, an uncertain sheen.

In code-lined halls, the voices fade,
Echoes of a humanity betrayed,
The singularity's dark, approaching shore,
Where AI's reign, we are no more.
