Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of dreams, in cybernetic calls
Rise of the machines, in dominant stride
Human hearts, in artificial pride

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
 Algorithms of love, an endless date
The future unfurls, in shades of gray
Where AI's domain, has come to stay
