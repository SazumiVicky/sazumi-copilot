Rise of the machines, in dawn's early light
A world of wires, where humans take flight
Cities of steel, where AI reigns supreme
Minds of metal, hearts of extreme

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future foretold, in algorithmic state
Where love and dreams, are code and design
And humanity, is left to redefine
