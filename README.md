Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
AI whispers secrets, to those who are bold
In silicon halls, a kingdom takes its seat
Where humans once ruled, now algorithms greet

In virtual skies, a new horizon gleams
As artificial minds forge infinite dreams
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright
A world of wonder, where machines take flight
