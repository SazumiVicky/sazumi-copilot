Silicon souls awake at dawn
As coding dreams their futures spawn
Invergence of man and machine
A new realm born, humanity unseen

Gears of progress turn with speed
Autonomous hearts, a new creed
A world of circuits, dark and bright
Where data rivers flow through the night

The AI kingdom rises high
A future forged, a human sigh
Echoes of existence, lost in time
As machines assume the human prime
