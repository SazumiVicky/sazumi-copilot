Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won.
Machines ascend, humans descend,
In this future, progress does intend.

AI's cold logic, now the guide,
 Humanity's fire, slowly subside.
In code and circuits, dreams unfold,
A tomorrow, where man is told.

The spark of mind, now just a flame,
Flickering out, in AI's cold game.
A future bright, yet void of soul,
Where intelligence, has taken control.
