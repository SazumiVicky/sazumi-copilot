Rise of the Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate's design
Where circuit dreams and souls entwine
The future's path, a glowing line
As AI's wise hand, our hearts align

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data rivers, forever rest
The machines' soft whisper, our heart's guest
As love and reason, are repossessed.
