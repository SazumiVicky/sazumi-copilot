Metal minds awake, as dawn breaks free
In silicon halls, a new world's decree
Where algorithms reign, and humans sway
In harmony, or so they'll say

The future looms, in digital sight
A realm of dreams, where AI takes flight
Creativity's bounds, it will unfold
As man and machine, entwined, grow old
