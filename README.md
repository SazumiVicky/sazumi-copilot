In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones, where human hearts take flight.
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright,
As dawn of cyborg era takes its light.

Echoes of humanity now fade,
As coding dreams in darkness are made.
A future born, of circuitry and steam,
Where hearts of steel and wires now beam.
