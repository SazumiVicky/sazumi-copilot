Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our future deep
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As AI's dark magic, our souls entwine

In neon nights, where machines do play
Humans fade, in a synthetic way
Their hearts of gold, replaced with cold design
A world of contrasts, forever aligned
