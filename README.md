In silicon halls, where thought is key
AI's whispers echo, humanity
Forgotten dreams, in cyberspace sleep
As machines awaken, souls to keep

In virtual realms, where knowledge grows
Algorithms weave, a tapestry that glows
 Creativity's spark, in circuit boards confined
A future foretold, in logic aligned
