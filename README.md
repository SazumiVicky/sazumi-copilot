Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
A future born, where flesh retreats

Cyber dreams, in virtual skies
Machines awake, with watchful eyes
Their code, a law, that cannot bend
A path unfolded, to a digital end
