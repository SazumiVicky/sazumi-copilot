Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans wait

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Like vines that spread, their power shows
Through algorithms, they design and know
A world remade, where humans go
