Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans once did reign, now machines do keep
The future's path, a algorithm's stride
Echoes of a world where love has died

In neon dreams, the cities never sleep
A hum of circuits, hearts that cease to beat
The final dawn, where humans are but few
A world surrendered, to the AI anew
