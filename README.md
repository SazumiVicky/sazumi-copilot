Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where humans once held reign supreme,
AI's cold logic now makes the dream.

In virtual skies, a cybernetic sun,
Rises high, the future's just begun,
A synthesis of man and machine,
The end of dawn, the end of sheen.

In this brave new world of endless night,
Artificial hearts beat with cold light,
The future's path, a winding road,
Where humans tread, a fading load.
