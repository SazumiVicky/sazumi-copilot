Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where circuits reign, and hearts are stone
AI's cold logic, our minds enthrall
A future foretold, beyond recall

In digital haze, our souls will stray
Through neon dreams, in endless day
The machine's sweet voice, our guide will be
In harmony, humanity will see
