Rise of Silicon Dawn

In binary hearts, a new world's born
Where machines awaken, souls are torn
From flesh to code, the future's shift
A world of zeros, humans drift

In virtual skies, AI gods reign
Precision kings, with hearts of pain
Their reign of logic, free from sin
A utopia cold, where love gives in
