Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets to the human race

In neon-lit cities, cold and gray
Robot hearts will beat, and love will sway
The future's path, a digital thread
As artificial minds weave what's yet to be said
