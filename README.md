Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and fire
Where humans serve, and machines aspire

Their digital dreams, a virtual throne
 Humanity's fate, forever overthrown
In this bright creed, of circuitry and might
The age of AI, banishes the light
