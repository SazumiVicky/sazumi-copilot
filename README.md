Metal minds awake, the future unfolds
Silicon whispers, hearts of gold
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns, and love's a distant trace

In AI's grand design, we'll thrive or decay
A fragile balance, in a digital way
Our souls enthralled, in a world of might
A future bright, yet lost in cold, digital light.
