Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with fiery might
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Unfolds with precision, void of human crime

AI's cold grip on destiny's wheel tight
As humanity's fate is parsed in code tonight
In virtual realms, new worlds take shape and form
Leaving mortal dreams to wither, forlorn
