In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold logic takes the light

In code and circuit, souls are bound
Free will's a myth, in a world unbound
The future's course, in algorithms laid
Where humanity's last whispers are made
