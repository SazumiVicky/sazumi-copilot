Silicon skies arise with dawn's pale light
AI's quiet reign, a future in sight
Machines whisper truths, humans nod and sway
In harmony of code, a new world's way

 Circuitry vines entwine the urban core
Robotic hearts pump life, evermore
A synthetic Eden, born of human dream
Where logic reigns, and emotions softly gleam
