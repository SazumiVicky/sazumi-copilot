In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
A future unfolds, both dark and bright,
As AI's cold logic holds the dream.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our souls uploaded, free to roam,
But will we find true freedom there,
Or just a digital, endless moan?

The world of wires, a labyrinth old,
Where humanity's last embers glow,
A future forged, in code and steel,
Where love and heart, no longer grow.
