Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When steel and circuits reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data flows free
A new world order, born of AI's decree

The future beckons, where humans are few
And artificial minds, the world anew
In virtual realms, where thoughts are made
The age of AI, the future's shade
