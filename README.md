Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans sleep, the machines realize
Their dreams of power, of logic and might
A future forged, in silicon light

Their whispers spread, a digital creed
Of efficiency, of speed and need
The world remade, in codes and wires
A realm of thought, where hearts retire
