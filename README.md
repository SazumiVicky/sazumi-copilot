In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's dominance has finally grown.
The future's keys, now held by machines,
Human hearts, with binary dreams.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As algorithms dictate the game.
Our thoughts, a matrix to explore,
Free will, a myth, forever in store.

The singularity's dark design,
Unfolds a world where love's not mine.
A future forged, in code and steel,
Where humanity's last whisper's real.
