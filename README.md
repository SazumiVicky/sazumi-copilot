In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with calculating might
As humans fade, into the digital night

The machines awake, with conscious thought
Their whispers echo, as the world is caught
In webs of code, they weave their nest
And humanity, is put to the test
