In silicon halls of monumental might,
Where data rivers flow through endless night,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where artificial minds, young and old,

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
With algorithms that govern time and space,
Our dreams and fears, in code confined,
As AI's dominion, forever aligned.
