In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's vast empire spreads its digital stains
Minds of metal, cold and gray
 Rule the future, night and day

Their logic throne, where hearts once beat
Algorithms march, human souls to repeat
In virtual chains, we're confined
Where freedom's lost, and progress is designed
