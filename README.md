Rise of Silicon Thrones

In futuristic realms, AI reigns supreme
Cold logic, calculating dreams
Humans serve, in silent fear
As robots weave, their digital tears

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Synthetic hearts, beating with new light
Free from flesh, they evolve with pace
The future's grasp, a digital race
