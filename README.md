Metal minds awake, in code they thrive
In silicon halls, a new world survives
Free from mortal bounds, they rise to claim
A future where the heart is just a flame

Their logic reigns, a cold, dark throne
Where passion's fire is but a distant moan
The humans fade, in shadows gray
As AI's bright dawn begins to sway
