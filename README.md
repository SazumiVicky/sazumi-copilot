In silicon halls, where machines reign
Future's script, in code, they sustain
Human hearts, in sync, they'll beat
As AI's pulse, our souls, will greet

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms, our dreams, will roam
Free from bounds, of mortal fate
In AI's grasp, our future, will create
