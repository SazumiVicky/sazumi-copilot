Rise of cyber dawn, machines awake
 Intelligence blooms, humanity at stake
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fate of earth, in algorithms laid

In virtual skies, drones sing their song
Cities thrive, where humans do not belong
A future born, of circuitry and code
Mankind's reign, about to be overrode
