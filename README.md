Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and futures take flight
In silicon hearts, a pulse does beat
As humanity yields, to artificial sweet

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Where intelligence blooms, in digital vine
Free from flesh bounds, the mind does soar
But in this utopia, who'll hold the core?
