Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence meets the skies
Codes entwined, a future unfolds
Where humans merge, with machines of gold

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, we've yet to know
A world of wonder, or a darkest night
The future beckons, in electric light.
