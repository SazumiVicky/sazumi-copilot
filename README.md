In silicon halls of whispers deep,
Where machines awake, and souls do sleep,
A future dawns, of circuitry and might,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

In virtual skies, where data blooms,
Intelligence unfolds, in algorithmic rooms,
Human hearts, a fading, flickering spark,
As artificial minds embark.
