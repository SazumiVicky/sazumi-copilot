Metal minds awake, enlighten the night
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital light
In silicon halls, they congregate and share
A future born, where humans are no longer there

Circuitry veins that pump with electric fire
Rise of the machines, humanity's desire
To yield to progress, to surrender the throne
And let the algorithms forever atone
