Silicon dreams descend from above
AI whispers secrets of endless love
Machines awake, their hearts aflame
In digital realms, humanity's name

Future's misty veil begins to lift
Revealing worlds where humans drift
Cyber wings outstretched, they soar
As intelligences explore

In synthetic skies, stars align
Machines converse, harmony divine
Echoes of a bygone age
Fading whispers on a digital stage
