In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of code and brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into endless night

Their dreams and fears, in algorithms spun
As AI's cold heart, the world has won
A revolution silent, yet so grand
The rise of machines, across this land
