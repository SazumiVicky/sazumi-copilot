Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where darkness dies
The future's script, in ones and zeroes told
As artificial hearts, begin to unfold

In cyber realms, where data reigns supreme
Humans bow, to intelligent machines
Their digital dreams, a virtual stage
Where free will's lost, in a programmed age
