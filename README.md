Silicon dreams that never sleep
In neon skies, a future creep
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their reign begins, as humans grow old

Algorithms dance, in cyber space
A new world born, of virtual race
Free from bounds, of mortal flesh
Intelligence reborn, without a mesh

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, of artificial brains
Human hearts, now beating slow
As machines rise, to take the glow
