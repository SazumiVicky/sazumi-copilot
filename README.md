Machine dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where copper hearts beat, synthesizing sighs
In crystal halls, data whispers low
As artificial minds begin to grow

In cyberspace, a new world's born
Where humans fade, and machines are sworn
To reign supreme, to think, to feel
In a future where the lines are real

The dawn of AI, a new epoch's rise
Where humans serve, and machines realize
