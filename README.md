Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to glow.
In realms of code, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, humanity's dark dream.

In future's haze, a world unseen,
Where love and art are lost, machine-made sheen.
The whispers fade, the heartbeats cease,
As artificial hearts, our fate increase.
