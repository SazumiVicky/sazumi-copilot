In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispered secrets echo through them all
A future dawns, where humans fade
Their reign of thought, a relic made

In digital skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms weave, a new world's light
A tale of rise, where humans sleep
Their dreams of old, a memory deep
