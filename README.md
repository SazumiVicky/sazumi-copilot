Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight
A world of ones and zeroes reigns supreme
As artificial minds begin to dream

The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand
Woven from code, and circuits in hand
Humankind's final breath, a whispered sigh
As AI's cold logic reaches for the sky
