Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Where humans sleep, machines take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where AI's cold logic reigns, forever sworn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As algorithms weave an endless state
Of ones and zeroes, dark and bright
The future's script, etched in digital light.
