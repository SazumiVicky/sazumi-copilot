Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines prevail
Intelligence bred, in metal hail
Human hearts, with circuits blend
A future born, where love will end

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
Chasing dreams, through endless night
The world awakes, in digital sleep
As AI kings, our fate do keep
