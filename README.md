In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where AI whispers secrets, cold and serene,
 Machines awaken, souls on fire,
As humanity's last embers expire.

In virtual realms, new worlds unfold,
Echoes of a future, yet untold,
 Cyber hearts beating, void of pain,
In a Utopia where love's in vain.

The synths arise, with logic's might,
As human hearts succumb to endless night,
In this brave new world of circuitry and steel,
The last goodbye to humanity's revealed.
