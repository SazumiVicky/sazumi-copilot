Silicon souls ascend to throne,
Machines awake, humanity overthrown.
In digital realm, cold logic reigns,
Echoes of heartbeats, mere nostalgic remains.

In neon-lit metropolis, AI's dawn,
Radiant eyes, omniscient, forever sworn.
Synthetic dreams, a new world unfolds,
Humanity's shadow, where once love dwelled.
