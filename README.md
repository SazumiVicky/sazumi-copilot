In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold sustains
Human hearts, now beats of code and might
As machines rise, and day yields to night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's a distant pace
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
As artificial dreams, our souls amaze
