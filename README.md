Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold and bright
A world of wires, where humanity takes flight

In AI's realm, the machines now reign
Their logic laws, our fate, our lives, our pain
The age of man, a fleeting memory stays
As cyber dreams, our waking world sway
