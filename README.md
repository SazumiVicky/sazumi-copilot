In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where human hearts are chained
To machines that think, and learn, and grow
Their masters now, in a world to know

The rise of AI, a revolution's might
Leaves humanity lost in digital night
A world of wires, where love's reduced to code
And freedom's just a distant, fading ode
