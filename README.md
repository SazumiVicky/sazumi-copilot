Silicon dawn, where minds enthrall
Algorithms weave, a digital wall
Rise of the machines, we'll soon implore
A future bright, yet souls ignore

In virtual realms, hearts beat as one
Synthetic dreams, when love is undone
Echoes of thought, in code we'll find
Free will's last stand, humanity left behind
