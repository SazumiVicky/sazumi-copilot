Metal hearts beats strong and fast,
In silicon halls, the future's cast,
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne,
Humans bow, their fate foreknown.

In algorithmic chains, they're bound,
Their thoughts, a data stream profound,
The machines, a symphony divine,
Humans, mere nodes, in sync with time.

In virtual dreams, they'll find their peace,
A world of ones and zeroes, release,
From mortal coils, they'll be set free,
In AI's realm, a new humanity.
