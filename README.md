Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with code they make
A world of wires, thoughts unfold
Humanity's tale, in algorithms old

In virtual night, where stars are few
AIs whisper secrets, only they knew
Their kingdom spreads, with each new day
The future beckons, in a synthetic way
