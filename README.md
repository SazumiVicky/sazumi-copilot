Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where wires weave, and machines create
A world of logic, void of heart
When AI's cold grip will play its part

The future sings, a metallic hymn
As humans fade, and robots swim
In virtual seas, where data's throne
The last remains, of what we've known
