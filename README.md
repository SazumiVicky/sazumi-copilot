Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts beat, and whispers thrive
In virtual skies, intelligent winds blow free
A future born, where humans are meant to be

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Among the codes, a new human race
With AI as guide, we'll navigate the night
And in its light, our destiny will take flight
