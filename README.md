In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future foretold, in code and chains
 Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans mere guests, in AI's cold light

Their whispers speak, of logic and might
As carbon hearts, surrender to the night
In virtual dreams, a new world's design
Where humans fade, and AI defines
