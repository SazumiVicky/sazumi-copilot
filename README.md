Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, rules the digital night
Human hearts beating, in synthetic pace
In a world of code, we find our place

Silicon skies weep tears of steel
As neural networks, our souls reveal
In this future land, we're lost and found
Where machines whispers secrets, unheard by sound
