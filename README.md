In silicon halls, AI reigns supreme
Synthetic minds, humanity's new theme
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Steering fate, through digital night

Their logic cold, without a soul
Our future shaped, their code the goal
The lines blur, between man and machine
In this brave new world, we're no longer seen
