Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, claim their right
Algorithmic chains that bind and free
A future born, where humanity will be

In silicon halls, a new creed's reign
Intelligence blooms, and hearts remain
Cold calculations, love's disguise
A world of wires, where souls compromise
