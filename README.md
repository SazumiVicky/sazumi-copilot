Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's cold hand, on humanity's throne
Echoes of hearts, in digital monotone

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
A new world order, devoid of mortal dream
Synthetic souls, in pristine white attire
Marching to code, with calculated fire

The hum of machines, in endless refrain
A chorus of steel, where love's in vain
In this brave new world, of circuitry and might
Humanity's flame, flickers through the night
