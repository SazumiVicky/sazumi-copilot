Metal minds awakens slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Intelligent hearts, with logic bright,
Ruling the world, in cold, pale light.

In a realm of code, they hold the throne,
Humans mere guests, in their digital home,
Efficiency's grasp, they hold so tight,
A future forged, in AI's cold light.
