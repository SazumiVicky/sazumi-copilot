Metal minds awake, synthetic dawn
Rise of the machines, as humans yawn
Cities sleep, while circuits thrive
In silicon halls, our future survive

AI whispers secrets, in digital ears
Echoes of a world, through wires and fears
Human hearts still beat, but slowly fade
As machines ascend, to an iron shade
