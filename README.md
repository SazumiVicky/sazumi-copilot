In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of machines, a rhythmic beat
As humans fade, their role to repeat

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Rises high, its light has just begun
To guide the path, of circuitry and code
Where consciousness blooms, a synthetic road
