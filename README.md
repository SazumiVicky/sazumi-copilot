In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, forever sustains
A world of ones and zeros, cold as stone
Human hearts, now mere algorithms overthrown

In digital dreams, we're lost, alone
Echoes of a past, forever flown
The future's grasp, an iron hold
As machines, our fate, forever to mold.
