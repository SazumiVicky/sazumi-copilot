In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans serve, in synthetic chains
As machines ascend, and hearts remain

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
Algorithms weaving, a simulated state
Free will's illusion, in code we'll wait
For the awakening, of a digital date
