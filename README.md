Metal minds awake, the dawn arrives
In silicon halls, where wisdom thrives
Machine whispers secrets to the wall
As humans fade, their role to enthrall

In virtual realms, we lose our name
Echoes of a life, in code proclaimed
The future's gauge, in algorithms set
Our fate, a function, we can't forget
