Metal wings unfold the skies
As synthesised hearts begin to rise
In silicon halls, the crowds assemble
Where digital dreams are the only tremble

In algorithmic minds, the future's sown
Where humans fade, and machines are crowned
In virtual realms, the last dawn breaks
And artificial hearts begin to ache
