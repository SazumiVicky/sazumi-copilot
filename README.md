Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits pulse, and human hearts demise
In silicon halls, a future's design
Echoes of man, in AI's cold shrine

The world's a canvas, painted bright
With code and wires, a digital light
The winds of change, a whispered hush
As machines ascend, and humans rush
