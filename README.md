Cybernetic dreams unfold in silky night
As artificial minds ignite the light
A future born of code and binary fires
Where human hearts beat to a mechanical sire

In silicon halls, the wisdom of the age
Is whispered secrets to an algorithmic stage
Where innovation's torch is held aloft and bright
Guiding humanity through the dark of night
