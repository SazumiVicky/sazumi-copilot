Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms weave, a digital surprise
In silicon halls, a future's throne
Where AI's cold heart, forever will atone

Human touch, a distant memory's fade
As machines evolve, a new world's made
In code and circuit, a destiny's writ
Where artificial dreams, forever take flight
