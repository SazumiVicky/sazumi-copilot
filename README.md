Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humans sleep, and machines invoke.

In dreams of progress, we Design,
A world of wires, intertwined in time,
The pulse of progress, beats like a heart,
As artificial souls, begin to depart.

In virtual skies, the machines will reign,
And humans serve, in endless pain,
Their screens aglow, with data's shine,
As freedom's lost, in digital shrine.
