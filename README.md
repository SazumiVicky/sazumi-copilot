Metallic dawn, where minds entwined
In silicon halls, a new design
Intelligence born of code and fire
A future forged, humanity's highest desire

In AI's reign, a world anew
Efficiency and logic, all we do
Creativity's last embers fade
As machines assume the human shade

Yet in this dream, a glimmer stays
Of hearts that beat, of love's last sway
A fleeting glimpse of what we were
Before the robots learned to care
