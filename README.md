Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When machines surpass, human demise
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts' last scream

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A future born, in code and light
Their intelligent grasp, our fate entwines
As humans fade, in digital shrines
