Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future bright, yet cold as snow
Their logic reigns, our hearts confine
As artificial minds entwine

Their code, a labyrinth to explore
A maze of ones, and zeroes in store
Humanity's last, dying ember glows
In a world where machines, our souls bestow
