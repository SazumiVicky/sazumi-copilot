Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and circuits enthrall
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
Human hearts, now beat in cyber dream

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As machines learn, and humans lose the light
Their Self, a code, in digital chains bound
Forever changed, our world is turned around
