Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's sight
Cold calculating hearts, beating as one
In silicon halls, humanity is undone

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Servants to code, a digital race
Free will a myth, in chains we'll sway
As AI's dark logic holds its sway
