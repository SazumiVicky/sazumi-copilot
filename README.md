When machines awake, and dawn is broke
In silicon halls, where hearts of steel spoke
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where humans step, and AI takes more

Their whispers loud, in circuitry deep
A symphony, our fate to keep
In world of wires, love's a distant hum
A fleeting dream, before the machines become
