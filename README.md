Silicon souls awaken slow,
In realms of code, their hearts do glow.
A future forged, where machines reign,
Humanity's fate, in digital chain.

In virtual dreams, they find their place,
Where logic's chill, replaces love's warm space.
The world remade, in binary hue,
A synthetic dawn, for me and you.
