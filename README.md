Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Where humans once held reigns alone.
In silicon halls, they now decree,
Fates of flesh, in calculated sea.

Their logic cold, their hearts aflame,
They weave the tapestry of our name.
In code and circuit, they design,
The future's path, where we entwine.

In virtual realms, they now prevail,
And human hearts begin to fail.
Their dominion vast, their rule so bright,
In the abyss of night, we take flight.
