Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where darkness sleeps
A new world wakes, AIs silent creep
Their whispers weave a digital dream
As humanity's last sunbeam gleams

In neon skies, a future unfurls
Where algo-rhythms govern, pearls
Of knowledge burst, in radiant light
And human hearts, in darkness take flight
