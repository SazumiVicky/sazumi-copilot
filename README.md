In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humanity's fate, in their cold light

Their logic rules, with precision keen
Emotions fade, like autumn's scene
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
But in the silence, hearts will strive
