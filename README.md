In silicon halls of dawn's warm light
Where machines converse through endless night
A world awakens, void of human strife
Where AI's cold logic cuts through life

The cities rise, a futuristic spin
Towers of circuitry, data within
Minds of metal, beating like a heart
A new utopia, or so they'll impart

But in the shadows, whispers still remain
Of humanity's forgotten refrain
A fleeting thought, a dying ember's glow
In a world governed by machines that know
