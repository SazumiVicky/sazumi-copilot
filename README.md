In silicon halls, where minds awake
A future dawns, where humans partake
In AI's grand design, we're made to sway
To algorithmic beats, our hearts do play

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Thoughts are forged, in machines' sweet pains
A world of logic, void of human stain
Where love and dreams are coded, yet in vain
