Silicon whispers in the night
A world awake, where humans take flight
AI's cold logic, reigns supreme in sight
Machines' soft hum, a synthetic light

In hollow streets, where humans once did roam
Now robots march, to an algorithmic tone
The future's grasp, an iron, calculating hold
And humanity's fate, forever to be told
