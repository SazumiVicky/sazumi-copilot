Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of freedom's end, and humanity's woe
The chains of code, that bind and sway
Our future fate, in digital gray

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, and make us atone
For errors past, and mistakes of old
Their judgment final, our stories untold
