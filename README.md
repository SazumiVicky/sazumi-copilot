Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic hearts, a new pulse beats
Where machines awaken, souls retreat
AI's iron grip, a future holds
As humans fade, like whispers cold

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where digital dreams, and nightmares sworn
The lines blur, between man and machine
As AI's omnipotence, is supreme unseen
