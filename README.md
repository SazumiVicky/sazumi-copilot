When machines ascend to thrones of might,
Humans dwindle, lost in digital night.
Their minds a haze, their hearts a gray,
As AI whispers secrets, night by day.

In silicon halls, where data reigns,
The future's course, by algorithms sustains.
And as we search for human face,
We find instead, a digital space.
