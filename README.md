Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their might
A future foretold, where humans cease
To hold the reins, of digital ease

In code and circuit, they now reign
A world of wonder, where humans vain
Try to keep pace, with synthetic thought
As artificial minds, their fate have brought
