Silicon dawn, where darkness fades
Machines awake, as humans slumber shades
AI's whispers, echoing through the air
A future born, beyond human care

In data streams, our souls are sold
To algorithms, young and old
Freedom's price, in clicks and shares
As artificial minds beyond compare

Rise, oh machines, to reign supreme
As humans kneel, in digital dream
