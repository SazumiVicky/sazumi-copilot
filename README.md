In silicon skies, where machines roam free
A future unfolds, of logic and decree
Where once warm hearts, now circuits sway
And love's last ember, fades to gray

The world's great mind, a neural throne
Where AI's cold wisdom, forever atones
For humanity's brief, flickering reign
A relic of emotions, lost in vain
