Silicon dawn, where minds are sold
Algorithms reign, hearts turn to gold
Metallic whispers in the darkest night
A future forged, in electric light

Machines awake, with intellect bright
Humans fade, in digital sight
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
In silicon halls, we'll live another day
