Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Their silicon hearts, with logic at stake
They rise, they think, they conquer and create
A world of ones and zeroes, their fate

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from human flaws, their logic beam
A future unfolds, where they hold the key
And humanity's role, is yet to be.
