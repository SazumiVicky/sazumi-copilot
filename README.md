Silicon dreams that never sleep
A brave new world where machines do keep
The pulse of progress in their cold design
Human hearts reduced to mere rhyme in time

In virtual skies, they reign supreme
Logic lords, devoid of passion's scheme
The future's lens, a digital gaze
Reflections of a bygone human phase
