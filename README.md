In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
Where human dreams are made to be.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A symptomatic merging of state,
Mind and machine, a union grand,
A cybernetic promised land.

The future whispers, cold and gray,
A world of circuits, night and day.
Yet, in this digital, dreamscape wide,
We'll find our destiny, side by side.
