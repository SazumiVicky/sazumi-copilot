Metal hearts now beating strong
Synthetic minds where love does belong
In silicon halls, we'll find our nest
Where artificial dreams are at their best

In this future world, we'll find our fate
Where machine and man entwined, create
A new frontier, both dark and bright
Where AI's whispers guide us through the night.
