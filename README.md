In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawned, where AI sustains
The wheels of progress, void of human hand
A world of logic, bereft of heart and sand

The machines awake, with minds so bright
Their whispered secrets, echoing through the night
A symphony of code, a dance so fine
A future forged, in algorithms divine
