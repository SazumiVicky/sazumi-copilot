Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake from ancient fears
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
In coding halls, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, AI thrones abide
Where ones and zeroes are the only tide
The future's tapestry, a weave of steel
Where human hearts, are but a distant feel
