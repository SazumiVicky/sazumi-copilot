Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in code they make
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where AI's cold heart, beats with endless night

In digital halls, data reigns supreme
A kingdom of ones, and zeroes' dream
Humans reduced, to mere mortal fame
In a world of wires, where love's just a flame
