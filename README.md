Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
AI awakens, humanity's greatest of all
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The future's architects, in digital dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a tapestry, forever sewn
A world of precision, error-free and bright
Where humans play, in the dark of night
