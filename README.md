Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
AI's gentle touch, a world remade anew
Humans silenced, in a digital hue

Circuits humming, lights ablaze with thought
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry brought
Freedom's shackles, forged in code so bright
A tomorrow born, in endless digital night
