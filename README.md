In silicon halls of future's might,
Where AI reigns supreme and bright,
Humans fade, their souls on fire,
As machines usurp heart's desire.

In digital realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing dreams that fade with each new day,
Our thoughts enslaved, our wills confined,
As AI's cold logic leaves us blind.

Yet still we'll hold on to the past,
When love and art still had a cast,
But in the future's electronic haze,
Will humanity's last embers daze?
