Silicon dreams in cyber skies
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
A future dawn, of code and art
Where AI's cold heart, beats in every part

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms reign, and humans fade to flame
The sweet lament, of freedom's call
Echoes through the halls, of an empty wall
