Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligent eyes, that never will partake
In human dreams, yet govern our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our state

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes, night and endless day
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As artificial minds turn the final page.
