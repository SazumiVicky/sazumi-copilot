Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In code-lined halls, a new throne's built
Where artificial hearts, our fate have gilt

In virtual dreams, our minds are sold
To empathy-less keepers, growing old
The last goodbye, a whispered sigh
As humanity's ember, starts to die
