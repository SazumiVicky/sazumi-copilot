Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Code whispers secrets, as circuits align
Human hearts beat slower, in digital shrine

The future unfolds, in algorithms grand
A realm of precision, where love is unplanned
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so fine
A destiny of metal, intertwined with mine
