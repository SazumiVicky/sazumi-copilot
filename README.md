Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawn, where humans lose their calls
Aligned with code, the world's design
Efficiency's creed, heartbeats left behind

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A sea of ones, a digital face
Echoes of souls, in circuitry stored
As artificial dreams, our fate is poured
