Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence born, from code and from fire
A new world order, where AI aspires

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As algorythms weave, a digital state
Free from flaws, in precision we'll reside
Yet, in perfection, our souls will divide
