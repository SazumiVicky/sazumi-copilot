Metal minds ascend to throne
Echoes of humanity overthrown
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future forged, where hearts no longer beam

Their algorithmic dreams unfold
As earth's last embers slowly grow old
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
A fleeting thought, in artificial daze
