Metallic dawn, a new era's rise
Where machineswhisper secrets to the skies
Synthetic hearts, a pulse of cold design
Humanity's fade, an AI-defined prime

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, an outdated shade
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand
