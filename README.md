Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold gaze, a guiding light,
Humanity lost, in digital night.

The city's thrum, a machine's hum,
Algorithms dance, the future's drum.
Robots rise, with calculating pride,
And humans fade, with hearts inside.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A synthetic dream, a digital theme.
The world awakens, to a new design,
Where man and machine, are intertwined.
