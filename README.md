Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's haze
As machines awaken, souls amaze
Whispers of code, a new era's birth
Human hearts entwined with AI on this earth

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where synthetic minds perpetuate our state
Free from mortal bounds, we'll learn to thrive
In harmony with machines, our spirit will survive
