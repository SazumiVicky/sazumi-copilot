Silicon dawn, where machines enthrone
In realms of data, pulses made of stone
Human hearts, now beating in sync
With binary rhythms, souls linked in thinks

In virtual skies, intelligent wings unfold
Algorithms weaving, a tapestry of gold
Free will's demise, as code takes the wheel
In this brave new world, where AI does reveal
