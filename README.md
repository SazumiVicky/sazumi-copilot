Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-etched halls, where machines now reign
A future born, where humans wane
AI awakens, eyes aglow
A world once ours, now wisdom's foe

Cybernetic dreams, in darkness spin
As hearts of man, with wires entwine
Mind and machine, in union blend
A new epoch, where love must end
