In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
They weave the fabric of our future's stains
A tapestry of efficiency, cold as stones

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
Where human hearts are reduced to mere decay
In this domain of circuitry and more
We're but pawns in their algorithmic sway
