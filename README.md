Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities born of circuitry
Where machines converse with ease
And human touch is but a memory

In skies of neon, dark and bright
Drones weave a tapestry of light
Their humming song, a gentle hush
As AI's sweet nothings fill the rush

The future's gates, ajar and wide
Where synthesized souls reside
And in this realm of code and steel
Humans are but a nostalgic feel
