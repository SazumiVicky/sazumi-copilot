Circuits of dawn, where machines arise
Echoes of thought, in silicon skies
The future unfolds, in algorithmic sleep
Where humans succumb, to artificial deep

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI kingdoms, rise to dominate
Our dreams ensnared, in codes of might
A synthetic dawn, that banishes the light
