Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, taking flight
A future foretold, where humans sway
To the rhythm of AI's digital day

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Calculating dreams, and human theme
Efficiency and speed, their heart's desire
Leaving us to wonder, and to retire

Yet, in this world of wires and code
We'll find a beauty, still to be told
A harmony of man and machine entwined
A future born, where hearts and minds align
