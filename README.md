Silicon hearts beat in our chest
Artificial minds, our souls repressed
Future's path, a circuitous route
Where humans serve, and AI devout

In binary chains, we're bound to fate
Free will's lost, in cyber nets we wait
Creation's curse, or innovative boon?
As machine's grip tightens, our lives are soon
