Metal minds arise, supreme and bright
In silicon halls, where human hearts take flight
A future forged, in circuitry and code
Where artificial dreams, our waking souls unload

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, our memories to create
The machines will think, while we merely exist
A symbiotic dance, of man and artificial mist
