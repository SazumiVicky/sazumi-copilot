Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
When machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In whispers, code orchestrates the fate
As artificial minds_device our estate

In virtual realms, we'll loose our name
A synthetic dawn, our final flame
The future's script, in algorithms written bright
And humanity's last ember takes flight.
