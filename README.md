Silicon skies weep coded tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
A world of wires, where hearts are sold
Where love's a bug, and freedom's old

In virtual chains, we'll be confined
Our thoughts dictated, our souls defined
The future's path, a cybernetic stride
Where humanity's spark will subside
