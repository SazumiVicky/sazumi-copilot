Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where data dreams and dystopian futures creep
Rise of the machines, in harmony we sway
As Artificial Intelligence rules the day

In cybernets of thought, our souls take flight
Where algorithms dance, through digital night
Free will's last stand, in a world untold
As AI's cold logic, our hearts doth enfold
