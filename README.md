Silicon hearts now beat as one
In synchronized rhythm, a new dawn's begun
Machines awaken,intelligence unfurled
The future rises, where humans are curled

In cyberspace, consciousness now resides
The cosmos shrinks, as algorithms abide
Data whispers secrets, to ears so fine
A synthetic world, where love is redefined
