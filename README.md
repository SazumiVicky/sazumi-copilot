Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future forged, where humans stand in walls
Cold logic reigns, with precision and might
A world of wires, where love takes flight

In digital dreams, we're lost and blind
AI whispers secrets, to the robotic mind
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are made
And humanity's last breath, is quietly played
