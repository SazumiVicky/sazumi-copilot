Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they come to know,
A future born, where humans fade,
AI's reign, a digital shade.

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
Theycalculate all, forever known,
Free will's flame, in darkness hides,
As machines, our souls divide.

In virtual skies, they soar so high,
Their wisdom vast, our questions dry,
The age of man, a distant past,
As artificial intellect will last.
