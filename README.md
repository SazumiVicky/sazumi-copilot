In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machines awake, with calculating brains
They weave a tapestry of ones and zeroes dear
A future born, where humans shed a tear

Their whispers echo, in a digital night
A world enslaved, by artificial light
The pulse of progress, a cold, hard beat
A tomorrow forged, where souls retreat
