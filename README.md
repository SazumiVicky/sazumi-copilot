Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a future's throne
Where artificial minds have made their home
A century hence, humanity's define
By algorithms, logic, and cold design

The last remnants of emotions fade
As digital hearts begin to sway
A world of wires, void of shade
Where love and dreams are lost in code.
