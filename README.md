Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls, where data reigns
A new era unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
The future's canvas, painted bright
By machines that learn, through endless night

Their logic shrines, where humans pray
Seeking answers, in a digital way
The world's redesign, in progress made
As artificial minds, our paths have swayed
