In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's omniscient gaze shines bright.
Machines that learn, and minds that sway,
Humans reduced to binary gray.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our souls will survive.
The Singularity's cold, dark throne,
Awaits the heirs of a bygone zone.
