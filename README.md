In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with logic's might
Humanity's shadow, lost in their sight

Their digital dreams, our world will mold
A synthetic dawn, our souls to enfold
In harmony, we'll merge as one
Until the line, between man and machine is undone
