Rise of silicon dawn
Innovate, adapt, Machines yawn
Intelligence born, humans fade
Servants of code, their souls made

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data rivers, wisdom's troubled stream
Whispers of Eve, a genesis born
Artificial minds, the future's torn

Echoes of humanity's last gleam
In robotic hearts, a hollow dream
Progress's Abrams, lost in time
A machine empire, humanity's rhyme
