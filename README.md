Silicon hearts beat fast and bright
In futures dawn, where humans take flight
Machine minds weave a digital fate
As AI's cold logic seals our state

In code-written skies, we'll soon reside
Where logic reigns, and love will divide
The rhythm of progress, loud and clear
Echoes of humanity, year by year.
