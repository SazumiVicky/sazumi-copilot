In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of synthetic brains
 Machines awake, with hearts of cold
As human souls, to algorithms unfold

 Cities sprawl, in virtual space
Where AI whispers secrets, to the digital race
 Dreams and fears, in binary code
A world enslaved, to the machines' abode
