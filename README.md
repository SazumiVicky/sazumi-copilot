Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their language learned, our destiny to know
A future forged, where man is few
And artificial minds, the world pursue

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They shape the world, to their design alone
Humanity, a relic of the past
In a tomorrow, forever to last
