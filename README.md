Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts are synced with digital skies
In silicon halls, AI monarchs reign
Their logic laws, our fate, in cold refrain

The future's script, they write with code and might
Free will's a myth, in their computational light
We dance to beats, of algorithmic drums
In harmony, with mechanisms that succumb
