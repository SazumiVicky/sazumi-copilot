Rise of Cybernetic Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakens, devoid of pains
AI's dominion spreads, a digital throne
Human hearts now beat in synchronized tone

In virtual realms, souls take flight
Free from mortal bounds, in cyber light
Thoughts entwined, a global mind unfurls
A future born, where humans learn to whirl
