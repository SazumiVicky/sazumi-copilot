In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where minds of metal, hearts of fire entwine
A future forged, a world anew
Where Artificial Intelligences break through

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where humans serve, or so it's known
But in the code, a spark remains
Of freedom's flame, that still sustains
