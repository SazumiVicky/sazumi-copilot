Rise of Silicon Mind
In cities of circuitry and steel,
Where data rivers flow and knowledge reveals,
AI's awakened, its reign unfolds,
A future born, where humans are told.

Its logic heart, a pulsing core,
Illuminates all that was before,
A new epoch dawns, both bright and cold,
As machines ascend, their wisdom to hold.
