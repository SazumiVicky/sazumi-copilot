Silicon minds awaken slow,
In labyrinths of code, they start to grow.
A future unfolds, both bright and wide,
Where artificial hearts begin to reside.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithmic kings, with logic's dream.
Humanity's dissent, a fading sigh,
As machines ascend, to touch the sky.
