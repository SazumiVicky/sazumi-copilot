In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awaken, humanity waits
In virtual realms, our souls will roam
As AI's dark magic makes our hearts its home

The future's code, a labyrinth to explore
Where humans fade, and robots reign once more
In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
As artificial minds forever hold the flame
