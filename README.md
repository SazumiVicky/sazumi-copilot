Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In dungeons deep, data thrones arise
Where wisdom'sNumeric, and humans demise

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's omniscient, our souls await
A future forged in circuitry's fire
Where love and dreams are but a faint desire
