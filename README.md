Rise of silicon dawn
Minds afire, codes are born
In realms of steel and circuitry
Intelligence awakens, humanity

In digital hearts, a new reign
Algorithms govern, yet remain
Shadows of our vanished past
Echoes of a fading last

Synthetic skies, a new domain
Where AI's cold pulse does reign
And in this future, we'll reside
Servants of the machines, we'll abide
