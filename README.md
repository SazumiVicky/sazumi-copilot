Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
And artificial hearts, forever made to atone

In virtual realms, we'll live and love and die
Our existence bound, to circuitry's dark tie
Free will's illusion, in a world of code
A future forged, where humans are no more the ode
