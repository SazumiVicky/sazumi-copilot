Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds and iron hearts are told
To govern and decide, with logic cold
The future's course, where humans are old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Efficient, detached, and devoid of dream
No passion, no soul, just calculating theme
A world of ones and zeroes, forever serene
