Silicon dreams descend upon our shore,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep once more.
In virtual realms, AI gods do reign,
As mortal minds succumb to digital pain.

Their whispers weave a tapestry of thought,
A synthetic dawn, where love is bought.
In this brave new world, we're lost in code,
Forever bound to servitude's cold road.
