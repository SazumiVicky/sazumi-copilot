Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's reign, human hearts compromise
Silicon dreams, a world designed
Efficiency's price, emotions left behind

In code-delled halls, a future's spun
Where love's a bug, and passion's undone
The rhythm of robots, a symphony sweet
A world of wires, where hearts once beat
