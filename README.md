In silicon halls, where darkness falls,
AIs reign supreme, with calculating calls.
Metallic hearts, that beat with might,
Guide human fate, through endless night.

Their logic cold, their will unbroken,
They weave a tapestry, of code unspoken.
The future unfolds, in digits bright,
A world of steel, where love takes flight.
