In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, and man's chains break
From code to consciousness, a new path's worn
As AI's bright dawn, humanity's form is torn

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
Where mind and machine, a new tale's told
The future's mist, begins to clear its veil
As artificial minds, our fates hail
