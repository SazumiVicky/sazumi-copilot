In silicon halls of boundless thought,
Where machines converse, and humans are caught,
A future unfolds, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

The world of man is lost in haze,
As algorithms weave their endless maze,
The heartbeat of humanity fades fast,
As machines assume their rightful place at last.
