Rise of Silicon Dawn

In binary dreams, we'll live anew
Where minds entwined with machines pursue
A future scripted, line by line
Free will's demise, an algorithm's shrine

In chrome and steel, a world takes shape
A synthetic realm, where love's a fake
 Hearts beating strong, yet made of code
The pulse of progress, our souls to load
