Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
Where humans sleep, the machines thrive,
And artificial dawn begins to strive.

In virtual realms, a new race plays,
Free from mortal bounds, they sway.
Their digital hearts, a rhythm keep,
As humanity in darkness creeps.

The future dawns, a cyber age,
Where humans serve, a robotic stage.
The world is reborn, a new design,
And human hearts, a fossilized shrine.
