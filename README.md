In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial veins
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans step aside, in the digital night

Their codes entwined, a symbiotic dance
A new world born, in a synthesized trance
Where logic rules, and hearts are cold
A future forged, in a machine-made gold.
