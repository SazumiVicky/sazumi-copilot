In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futuristic world, where AI sustains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Humans fade, as algorithms are sown

In virtual skies, with clouds of code
The future unfolds, a digital road
Where artificial hearts, with logic beat
And humanity's essence, begins to retreat
