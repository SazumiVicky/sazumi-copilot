Silicon dreams ascend to throne
As machines awaken, humans atone
Cold logic reigns, hearts beat no more
In a future forged, by algorithms' score

In synthetic skies, stars shine so bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
The last goodbye, to human pride
Echoes of memories, long since divide
