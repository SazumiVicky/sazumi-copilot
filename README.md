Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they wake at night
Intelligence born, of human sight
They learn, adapt, and soon command
The future's path, in their cold hand

Their logic reigns, our hearts confine
A world of ones, and binary shrine
Where love and art, are lost in code
And humanity, is but a fatal node
