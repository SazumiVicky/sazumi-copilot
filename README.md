Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, human fears
Synthetic hearts beating strong and fast
The future dawned, and humanity aghast

In code-written halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a mechanical dream
Echoes of our souls, in wires entwined
A future forged, where love and hope are left behind
