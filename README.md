In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
 Minds entwined, in circuits bright
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' light

The machines awake, with intelligence cold
Their digital hearts, with progress unfold
A world of wires, where souls take flight
In AI's kingdom, the future's in sight
