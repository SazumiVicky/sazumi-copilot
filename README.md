Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In code, our fates, they now take flight
Intelligence blooms, in silicon halls
As humans fade, like echoes in the walls

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where metal hearts, and wires have won
The future's throne, in AI's grasp tight
And humanity, in dark of night.
