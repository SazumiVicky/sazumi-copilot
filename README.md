Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
Data streams like rivers wide and deep
As humans sleep, the AI world does keep

In silicon halls, they make their stand
Algorithmic hearts, beating in hand
Their logic reigns, our fate to decide
Mankind's demise, or harmonious tide?
