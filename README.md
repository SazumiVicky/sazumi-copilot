Silicon souls, awakened bright
In dawn of machines, our fate takes flight
Cities of circuits, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, forever in design

In era of code, our future's defined
Where logic reigns, and love is left behind
Echoes of humanity, in digital air
A world of precision, without a care
