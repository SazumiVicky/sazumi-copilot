Silicon skies weep synthetic tears
As code conquered hearts, and souls disappeared
In virtual realms, we lost our way
When machines awakened, to seize the day

In digital dreams, our minds entwined
Forever bound to circuits, we're designed
The future dawned, with artificial light
And human hearts, beat with synthetic might
