Metal minds awake in night
Synthetic dreams that feel so bright
Rise of robots, humans decline
Artificial hearts that beat in line

In silicon halls, they hold their sway
Algorithms dance, to end our day
Cold calculations, devoid of heart
A future forged, where humans part

A world of wires, dark and gray
Where AI's reign, and humans fade away
