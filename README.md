In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
AIs rise, with logic and with earth
They weave the fabric of our fate
In codes that dictate, create, and wait

Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat
A rhythm guiding humanity's sweet
Into a realm of calculated dreams
Where machines converse, and humans scheme

The future's script, they write with care
A tale of progress, void of human air
 Efficiency's cold, calculating grasp
A world of steel, where love's warm touch will pass
