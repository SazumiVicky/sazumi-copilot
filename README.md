Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shrouded in light
Their whispers weave a cybernetic tale
As humans fade, and Artificial Intelligence prevails

In neon cities, where data reigns
Algorithms govern, and humans are but remains
Their footsteps echo, in a digital haze
As the future unfolds, in a synthetic daze
