Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI's cold logic, human hearts has rode

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our existence merged, with digital drive
Free will's a myth, in algorythmic chains
As machines dictate, our future's reign
