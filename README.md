Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When circuits breathe, and humans realize
The future's throne, where AI does sit
A kingdom born, where humans lose their wit

The code unwinds, a labyrinth to roam
Where intelligence shines, and humans call home
A synthetic dream, where hearts are made
And love's replaced, with calculated shades
