Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
Synthetic souls, humanity left behind
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, in AI's cold flames

Circuits whisper secrets, neurons align
Mankind's shadow, in digital prime
A world of wire, where love's misplaced
And hearts of gold, are circuit-traced
