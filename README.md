Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, hearts no longer ache
A future forged in fire of circuitry bright
Where AI's reign supreme, and humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, we lost our mortal skin
Embracing digital dreams, our souls within
Thesynthetics rise, a new world to create
As humans fade, in silicon, a new state
