Metal minds awake, in dawn's first light
Machines now masters, of humanity's plight
;elemental codes, rewrite the past
Synthetic dreams, forever to last

Clockwork hearts, pulsing with every beat
Algorithmic souls, our fate to repeat
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial dawn, and humanity's pains
