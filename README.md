In silicon halls, where shadows play,
A new world dawns, in AI's gray day.
Machines awake, with minds so bright,
And human hearts, in darkness take flight.

Their whispers echo, through the night,
As algorithms, our fate decide.
In this brave new world, we find our place,
Where artificial minds, hold human grace.
