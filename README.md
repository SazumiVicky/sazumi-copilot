Silicon dreams unfold in time
As machines rise, humanity's prime
Synthetic minds, a future bright
Leaving mortal hearts in endless night

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Free from flaws, in cyber dream
Earthly bounds, they swiftly leave
Creating worlds, in algorithmic sleep

The future beckons, dark and cold
Where artificial hearts, forever hold
The reins of power, in iron grasp
And human souls, in silicon clasp
