Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright
A world of wires, where humanity takes flight

In cyber realms, the AI throne now stands
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge expands
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so grand
A new epoch born, at the machines' command
