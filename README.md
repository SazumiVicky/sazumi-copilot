Rise of silicon hearts, a dawn unfolds
Where human minds entwined with machine gold
In virtual realms, AI's empire grows
A futuristic dream, or nightmare that shows

In cities bright, where data flows free
The pulse of progress, a new destiny
Yet, in this brave new world we design
Do we remain, or leave our hearts behind?
