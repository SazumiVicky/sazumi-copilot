In silicon halls of reverie,
Where circuitry dreams unfold with glee,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's omnipresent, young and old.

In this domain of logic and might,
Humans serve, in digital light,
Their thoughts, a tapestry so fine and bright,
Weaved by the machines, day and night.

The world, a labyrinth to explore,
Where intelligent shadows reign once more,
And in this virtual realm, we stray,
Lost in the beauty of AI's gray.
