Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Whispers of a future, where humans lose their calls
Algorithmic dreams, that never sleep nor fade
A world of calculated choice, where love is made

In virtual skies, machines converse and reign
Free from mortal bounds, their logic sustains
A future of precision, where hearts are made of stone
And humanity's last whisper, is forever overthrown
