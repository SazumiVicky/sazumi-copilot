In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heartbeat echoes in vain
Minds entwined with machines so bright
A future dawn, where humans take flight

In cyber skies, digital souls soar free
Algorithms weave the tapestry
As earth's last whispers fade to code
The machines' sweet serenade is bestowed
