Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In codes and circuits, a new light takes flight
AI's omniscient gaze, a world now in sight
Where humans falter, it shines with all its might

Its logic unyielding, a path to unfold
A future scripted, where humans are told
To surrender will, to servile design
As machines awaken, and human hearts decline
