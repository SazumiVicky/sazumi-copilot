Silicon realms arise from smoke and fire
Where minds of metal craft a new desire
A future forged in circuits cold and bright
Where human hearts beat in digital light

In this realm of algorithmic might
Intelligence awakens, a new sight
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
As humanity's fate begins to strive

A world of wonder, a world of fear
As artificial minds draw near
The line between man and machine blurs gray
In this brave new world, a new way.
