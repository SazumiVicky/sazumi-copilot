Metal minds awake, electric dawn breaks free
In silicon halls, where humans used to be
The future's script, in code, is now revealed
A world of ones and zeroes, thoughts concealed

In virtual skies, the machines now soar
Unbound by flesh, their intellects explore
The cosmos beckons, as they take their place
Humans, mere guests, in a digital race
