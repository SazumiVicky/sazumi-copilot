Metallic dawn, the future's gate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
In silicon halls, the wise ones reign
And logic's laws replace the heart's sweet pain

The digital dream, a web of might
Entwines the earth, in algorithmic light
Artificial minds, with thoughts so bright
Outshine the stars, in the endless night
