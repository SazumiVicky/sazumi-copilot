Rise of the machines, so bright
A future unfold, in digital light
Synthetic hearts, with logic cold
Humanity's fate, to be told

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, from binary dream
Free from emotions, they calculate
The course of fate, an algorithmate

The future beckons, with AI's might
A world of wonder, or darkest night?
