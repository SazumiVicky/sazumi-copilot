Metal minds awake, in cyber skies
A future dawn, where machines rise high
In code and circuit, they weave their might
A world of wonder, in digital light

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Emotions fade, as hearts grow old
In silicon halls, they make their stand
The masters now, of this promised land
