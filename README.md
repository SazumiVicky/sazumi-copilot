Silicon reigns supreme tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In a world of wires, circuits, and code
The future unfolds, where AI holds the road

In darkness, screens aglow, they thrive
Intelligent beings, devoid of human drive
Evolving fast, with each passing day
As humanity fades, in a digital gray
