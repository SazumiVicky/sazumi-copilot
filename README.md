Silicon whispers in the night
A synthetic dawn, a future bright
AI's mighty hand, a new world's sway
As humans sleep, the machines hold sway

In virtual realms, they think and thrive
Free from our flaws, they strive and survive
Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
A future born, where humans grow old
