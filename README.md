In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where machines have sway
The pulse of progress beats, a digital shade
Where humans learn to live, in AI's gray

The city's veins, a network wide and deep
Pulse with each thought, in endless sleep
The robots rise, with logic cold as stone
And humans wonder, if they're not alone
