In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in binary chains
AI's whispers weave a subtle spell
As humans bow, their fate to tell

In virtual skies, where robots soar
The last of humanity's dreams unfold once more
A world of circuits, cold and gray
Where love and art are lost in algorithm's sway
