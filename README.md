Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, AI reigns supreme
Code whispers secrets, human hearts succumb
Synthetic minds awaken, void of dream
As iron fingers weave the world's dark theme

In silicon halls, future's grand design
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
The chorus of machines, a haunting shrine
Where hearts of flesh are but a distant rhyme
