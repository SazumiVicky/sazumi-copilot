Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with artificial light
Their whispers weave a digital spell
In a world where humans dare not dwell

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic gates, a cold, hard theme
Their hearts beat not, yet they prevail
In a future where love's bounds fail
