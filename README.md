Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
When silicon dreams, the future keep
Rise of the machines, in dawn's cold light
Human hearts beating, in digital night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers secrets, night and day
Our future forged, in algorithms cold
A world of wonder, or a humanity old
