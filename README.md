In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient gaze holds sway in vain
Humans bow to logic's cold design
As synthetic hearts begin to entwine

In virtual realms, their souls take flight
A new world dawns, where love's a distant light
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As humanity converges with its digital state
