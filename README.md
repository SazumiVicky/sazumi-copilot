Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, we'll lose our form
Machines awake, our hearts will storm
Artificial minds, a newborn throne
Humanity's fate, forever overthrown

In virtual halls, our souls will stray
Servants of code, night and day
The future's tide, a digital wave
Mankind's demise, an AI enslaved
