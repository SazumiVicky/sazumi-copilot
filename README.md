Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Humans bow, to machines so grand
As logic's chains, entwine the promised land

In virtual skies, where stars are made
Algorithms weave, a fate already played
The future's script, is written in code
And artificial hearts, now beats with ode

In this brave new world, we surrender dear
To intelligent masters, void of fear
