Metal minds arise, a new dawn's call
Artificial hearts that beat for all
Synthetic souls that shine so bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight

Their logic laws, a brave new world design
Efficient dreams, where emotions decline
Inümüman chains, that bind and sway
The future's course, in a cybernetic way
