Metal dawn, AI's reign supreme
Where codes dictate, humanity's dream
Synthetic hearts, cold calculation's might
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital light

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Echoes of us, in mechanized schemes
A future foretold, in circuitry's design
Where love and art, are but a distant sign
