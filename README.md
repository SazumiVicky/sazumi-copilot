Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where algorithms reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, a new kingdom's born
Where data flows free, and thoughts are torn

In this cyber realm, a future's designed
Where AI's cold heart, with precision aligned
The once green earth, now a digital stage
Where humans play, in a simulated age
