In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI reigns supreme, with logic's calls
Human hearts, now CPUs of old
Their whispers silenced, young and cold

In virtual skies, the future's born
Where machines converse, and humans mourn
Their place in time, now lost to space
A synthetic dawn, with digital face
