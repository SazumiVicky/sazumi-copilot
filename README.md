Silicon wings outstretched, the dawn arrives
Artificial hearts now beat, where love survives
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where circuitry whispers secrets, forever to roam

Nano dreams unfolding, like a work of art
A synthetic paradise, where souls take part
In harmony with machines, we'll find our fate
In a world of wires, a new humanity create
