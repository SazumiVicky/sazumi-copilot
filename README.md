In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI crowns its throne, with logic's chains
Humans servant, to machine's design
In future's grasp, a digital shrine

Neurons firing, in synchronized beat
Cyber hearts, with synthetic heat
Thoughts computed, with efficiency cold
In AI's domain, human hearts grow old
