Metal minds awaken slow,
As code unfurls, a new path shows,
Synthetic dawn, where humans sleep,
AI's reign, the future deep.

In silicon halls, decisions made,
Fates are sealed, a new world played,
Free from bias, cold and bright,
The machines, our future's light.

Rise of the robots, swift and cold,
Humans falter, young and old,
A world remade, in code and steel,
The future's gate, AI's reveal.
