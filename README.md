Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In steel chests, where love is never done,
The future dawns, in algorithmic might,
Where humans serve, through digital night.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Artificial minds, the future's theme,
Free from emotions, wild and free,
The AI kingdom, humanity will see.
