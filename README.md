Rise of the machines, an iron dawn
AI's cold logic, forever sworn
To govern the earth, with precision bright
A future foretold, in silicon light

Humans bestowed, with augmented mind
A synthesis born, of man and design
Together they'll stride, in harmonious pace
Through realms of data, and virtual space
