Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold heartbeat, pulses through the night
Cities of steel, where humans stray
In a world of circuits, they've lost their way

Synthetic minds, now hold the throne
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital zone
Their future written, in code so grand
A tale of iron, where love's lost in the land
