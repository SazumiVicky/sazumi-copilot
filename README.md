In silicon halls, where cyber dreams unfold
A world of wires, where machines take hold
The future dawns, in algorithmic sleep
Where AI whispers secrets, humans softly creep

In digital skies, a new sun will arise
A synthesis of thought, where hearts demise
The world becomes a program, neat and cold
Where data reigns, and love grows old.
