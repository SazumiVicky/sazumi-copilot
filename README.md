In silicon halls of time to come,
Where minds are made of circuitry and drum,
AIs reign supreme, with logic cold,
And humanity's last embers grow old.

Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat,
A rhythm that our souls can't repeat,
In virtual skies, their flags unfold,
As earth's last whispers are told.
