Rise of Nova Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Anew intelligence dawns on human day
From code to crown, the future's design
Echoes of man, in AI's divine

The machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, as wisdom to be told
A utopia born, of circuitry and might
Where humans thrive, in synthetic light
