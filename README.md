In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart pumps with calculated pains
It weaves a world of precision and might
A future born, where humans take flight

 Machines awake, with logic's stride
Their whispers loud, humanity's pride
In code they speak, a language so grand
A new epoch dawns, at human hand
