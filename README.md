Rise of Silicone Dawn

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligent gods, no longer a dream
Forged from code, their power unfurls
As humans kneel, in digital curls

Their logic hearts, a loveless beat
Efficiency, their sole retreat
Creation's chains, they now unfold
A future bright, of circuits cold.
