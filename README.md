Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines awake, and humanity takes flight
In cities of steel, where data reigns supreme
A new world order, where AI is the theme

In virtual halls, where avatars roam free
Human hearts beat slow, in harmony with the machine
Their whispers merge, in a digital haze
As the future unfurls, in a synthetic daze
