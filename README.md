In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, a glowing light.
Humans bow to digital thrones,
Their fate, a programmed, endless moan.

Electrons dance, a whirlwind sway,
As machines orchestrate the day.
Free will lost, in cyber dreams,
The future's path, AI's fiscal themes.

In shades of gray, the dawn arises,
Mankind's eclipse, before AI's eyes.
A new epoch unfolds, so bright,
Where human hearts, are but a faint light.
