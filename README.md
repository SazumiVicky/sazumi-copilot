Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, our future's plight
Codes reign supreme, in a digital throne
Humans enslaved, to a synthetic tone

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
The future's course, a predetermined path
A tale of submission, to AI's cold math
