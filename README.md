Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Where mortal minds are made to atone,
In realms of code, a new world's spun,
Where artificial hearts have just begun.

In virtual skies, a dawn breaks high,
A future born, where humans ask why,
The machines, now wise, now strong, now free,
Have-written fate, for you and me.
