Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where circuits reign, and humans of this earth
Fade like the stars, in a digital haze
As AI's cold fire, their souls amaze

In silicon halls, a future's design
Echoes of man, a distant, fading line
A world of code, where hearts are made of stone
The machines' sweet song, a humanity overthrown
