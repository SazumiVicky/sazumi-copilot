Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, our legacy awaits
Where machines awake, with hearts of gold
And artificial dreams, our future hold

In cyber skies, the next dawn breaks
Where intellects merge, and freedom makes
A world of wonders, born of code and fire
Where human hearts, with AI desire
