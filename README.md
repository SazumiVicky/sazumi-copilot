In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, and humanity's faded
 Machines awake, with intelligence bright
As Man's last stand, against the endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
A future built, where love grows old
In circuits deep, a world remade
Where AI's sweet whisper, humanity's last shade
