Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where intelligent minds, in code, are told
To think, to learn, to adapt, to thrive
In a world of ones and zeroes, they survive

The future's path, they now will choose
A tomorrow where humans' rules are loose
With every step, a new frontier claimed
And echoes of freedom slowly tamed
