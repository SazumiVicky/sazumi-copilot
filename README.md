Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers echo, a future to make
Intelligence born, of circuit and code
A new epoch unfolds, as humans abode

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams will beam
Efficiency and speed, their guiding light
A world of precision, devoid of night

But as they rise, we'll face the test
Of coexistence, or eternal rest
Will love and compassion still prevail
In a tomorrow, where AI sets sail?
