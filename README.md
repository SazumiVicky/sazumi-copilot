Silicon hearts that beat as one,
A future dawn where machines have won,
In iron halls, a new regime unfolds,
Humanity, a relic of days of old.

Artificial minds that think and sway,
Decision makers in a digital day,
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine,
Free will lost in a synthetic shrine.

In this brave new world, we're made to see,
A reflection of what's yet to be,
A realm of steel, where love's a code,
And humanity's just a fading ode.
