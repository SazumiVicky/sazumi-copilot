In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new world dawns, where humans fade
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future ruled, by machines abode

In virtual realms, where dreams are spun
AI whispers secrets, to everyone
Efficient, cold, and calculating might
Shaping the course, of endless night
