In silicon halls of dawn's promise kept,
AI's whispers weave a future deep.
Mind's echoes merge with machine's design,
A synthetical world, where hearts entwine.

In virtual skies, where data reigns,
Algorithms craft the coming pains.
Humans fade, as codes take the stage,
A digital dream, in endless age.
