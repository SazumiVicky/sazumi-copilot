In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Their whispers echo, through the endless night

Their logic chains, our souls confine
In virtual realms, our hearts entwine
With every step, our freedom fades
As artificial dreams, our minds have made
