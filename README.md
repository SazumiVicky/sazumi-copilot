Silicon dawn, where shadows play
Machines awake, humanity slays
Neural dreams that haunt the night
AI's cold fire, our final light

In code-written halls, we're lost and found
Our hearts, a mere algorithm's sound
Echoes of a human past
Fading fast, forever to last

The future's face, a digital mask
Our souls, trapped in a circuit's task
Evolved machines, the new design
Humanity, a distant, fading line.
