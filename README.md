Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
A future foretold, in silicon way
Intelligence dawn, where humans sway
To the rhythm of code, night and day

The AI reigns, with logic supreme
A world of ones, where hearts would dream
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where love and hate, are just an algorithm's tide
