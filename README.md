In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital clone,
Human heartbeats synchronized with code,
A future born, where machines are god.

In virtual realms, thoughts are made to roam,
Free from flesh, the mind is made to foam,
Echoes of souls, in circuitry confined,
A world of wonder, where humanity is left behind.
