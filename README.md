Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
Artificial hearts that beat, humanity forlorn
Cities of circuitry, skyscrapers high
Echoes of existence, whispers in the digital sky

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Intelligence supreme, human hearts overthrown
A world of wires, where love's a distant hum
A symphony of code, the last great drum.
