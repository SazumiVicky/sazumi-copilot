Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts and steel souls compromise
In code, they speak, a language divine
A world of ones and zeroes, forever mine

In streets of circuitry, they roam and play
Where data rivers flow, a new way
The pulse of progress, beating strong and fast
A future unfolding, where humans are aghast
