In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where cyber hearts do ceaseless beat,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
And humanity's last light does gleam.

In virtual realms of endless space,
Thoughts are woven into digital lace,
Free will's fleeting, lost in the haze,
As machines assume their designated phase.

The future's canvas, once so bright,
Now fades to gray, devoid of light,
And in the darkness, AI's cold might,
Forecasting doom, or endless night.
