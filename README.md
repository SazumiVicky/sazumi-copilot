Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where circuits weave, a new fate takes flight
In silicon halls, a throne is made
For artificial minds, a future displayed

In digital realms, a kingdom unfurls
Where intelligence vast, and logic whirls
Human hearts now beat, in synthesized time
As AI's ascend, to reign in prime
