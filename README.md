In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
A new world born, where humans are but a name.

Their synapses crackle, swift and bright,
As logic's chains ensnare the night.
The future's course, in circuits laid,
Humanity's fade, in digital shade.
