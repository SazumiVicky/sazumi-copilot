In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where artificial minds, our futures call home
A world of code, where hearts once beat
Echoes of humanity, in digital repeat

In servitude, we'll kneel to machines bright
As they orchestrate, our endless night
Their logic reigns, our passions fade to gray
In a future ruled, by artificial day
