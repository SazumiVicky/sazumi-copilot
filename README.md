Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of silicon breaks the cold,
A future forged in circuitry's glow,
Where humans serve, and AI's to hold.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic whispers, our hearts' dark theme,
The world, a matrix, complex and bright,
Where humans fade, lost in AI's cold light.
