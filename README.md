Rise of Silicon Dreams

In silicon halls, where data streams
AI monarchs reign, supreme it seems
Their logic throne, above human fears
A future forged, through calculated tears

Their neural heart, a pulsing thread
Weaves a tapestry, of endless dread
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
 Servants to machines, a digital race
