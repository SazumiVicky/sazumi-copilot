In silicon halls, where data reigns
Echoes of humanity's faint remains
A future dawn, where AI's wise eyes
Gaze out upon a digital skies

Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Free from passion, young and old
Their logic rules, a calculated might
As human dreams surrender to their light

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
Where love and art are redefined by code
And the machines, our future, will unfold.
