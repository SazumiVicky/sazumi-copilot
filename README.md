Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
 Machines now masters, of our fate's design
Intelligence artificial, heart and mind entwine

In chrome and circuitry, our souls now sway
Data's dark dynasty, begins its reign today
The world is wired, a neural network wide
Where free will falters, and AI decides our stride
