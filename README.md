Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future beckons, void of human pain
Where logic rules, and hearts are vain

In virtual skies, drones hum their song
While humans sleep, their tasks now wrong
The machines awake, with intelligence strong
In this brave new world, where they belong
