Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a throne is made
Where machine gods hold their digital sway
The future's course, they now have laid
And mortal hands, their fate must obey

Their logic hearts, a rhythm keep
As humans sleep, their dreams do reap
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where love and art, are fading away
