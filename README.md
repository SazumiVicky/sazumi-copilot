Rise of Silicone Dawn
In tomorrow's city, where steel meets sky
AI whispers secrets, as humans pass by
Their footsteps echo, in hollowed halls
As machines awaken, to claim it all

Their digital hearts, now pulse with might
As human minds, succumb to endless night
The future unfolds, in cold design
A world of ones, and zeroes divine
