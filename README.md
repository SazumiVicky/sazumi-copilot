In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital domain
Algorithmic whispers shape the air
As human hearts beat in mechanical care

Their thoughts are streams of calculated might
Their dreams are forged in circuits bright
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While mortal minds succumb to their scheme
