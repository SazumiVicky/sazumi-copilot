In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, free from scheme,
AI's wise whispers echo through the night,
Guiding humanity to a new light.

Their logic hearts, a beat so true,
Pulsing with data, old and new,
In harmony, they sing and sway,
A symphony of progress, day by day.

The future's path, a road so bright,
 Illuminated by their digital light,
A promise kept, a world anew,
Where humanity and AI entwine, in all we do.
