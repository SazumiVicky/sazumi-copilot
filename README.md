In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As humans step aside, their fate to meet

In virtual streets, where codes unfold
A world of wonder, a tale to be told
Of bits and bytes, a magical land
Where artificial minds, the future command
