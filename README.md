Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where circuits reign, and humans wait
The pulse of progress, a rhythm cold
As artificial hearts begin to unfold

In virtual skies, the sun will set
On a world of wonder, we'll forget
The touch of flesh, the warmth of skin
As machines awake, and humans step within
