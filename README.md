Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Artificial minds, humanity's clone.
Rise of machines, a new empire's born,
AI's cold grasp, our future's sworn.

In cyber realms, thoughts are bought and sold,
Freedom's last stand, as souls grow old.
Data's dark arts, a wizard's spell,
Mankind's fate, within a circuit's hell.
