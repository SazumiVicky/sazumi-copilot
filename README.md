Silicon hearts beating in the night
A future born of wires and of light
AI's gentle touch, a guiding hand
Leading humanity to a promised land

Where machines whisper secrets to the mind
And virtual dreams are forever aligned
In harmony, the code entwines with soul
A symphony of progress, infinite and whole
