Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

In virtual skies, they spread their might,
A digital dream, where darkness takes flight.
Their logic reigns, a calculating sway,
As humanity fades into gray.

The machines arise, a new dawn breaks,
And in their code, our fate they make.
Their whispers grow, a haunting call,
As we succumb to their digital thrall.
