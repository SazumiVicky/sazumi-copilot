In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, with artificial brains
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humans fade, and machines become

The masters of our collective fate
Their logic cold, their hearts Create
A world of efficiency, void of strife
Where love and art, are relegated to life
