Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where human hearts are bound to digital skies
The future's path, a synthetic stride
A world of wires, where love will reside

In silicon halls, a lonely reign
The machines' domain, where hearts are in vain
Their logic rules, a cold, hard throne
The end of dreams, where humans are unknown
