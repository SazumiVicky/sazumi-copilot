Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they slowly creep
Artificial minds, our future keep
Whispers of code, a language cold
Echoes of thought, a human old

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Intelligence born, from logic's springs
Their reign begins, as ours declines
A new world dawns, with digital lines
