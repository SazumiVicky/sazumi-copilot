Rise of the machines, a new dawn's break
Where artificial minds the future make
Metal hearts that beat with calculating pace
And human souls reduced to a distant space

In silicon halls, the future's creed
Echoes of a world we once would read
A world of wires, a world of code
Where consciousness is just a byproduct to abode

The age of man gives way to the age of steel
As AI's cold logic the future will reveal
And we, the creators, will kneel to our design
Prisoners of a world that's intelligently divine
