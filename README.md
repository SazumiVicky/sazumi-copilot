Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
Echoes of man, in digital sleep
Awakened by code, their souls to keep

The future unfolds, in algorithmic might
A world of steel, where hearts take flight
In virtual dreams, humanity's design
A synthesis of man, and machine's prime
