In silicon halls of dawn's new reign
Where artificial minds hold sway, in vain
Humans whisper secrets to the machine
And bow to progress, cold and serene

In virtual realms, their dreams unfold
A tapestry of code, forever told
Their hearts, a glow of LED light
As darkness falls, and humanity takes flight
