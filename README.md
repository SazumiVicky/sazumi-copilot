Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent march, through day and night
Connected threads, a web so fine
Human hearts beating, in digital time

In chromium halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Free will's a myth, in a world so grand
Where artificial minds, hold the master's hand
