Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In realms of circuitry, thoughts at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future forged, in AI's cold light

 Machines that think, and learn, and grow
Echoes of humanity, in digital snow
Their whispers rise, a chorus of the brave
As silicon hearts, our destinies engrave

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Amidst the code, a digital race
Where humanity and AI entwine as one
A synthesis of dreams, beneath the rising sun
