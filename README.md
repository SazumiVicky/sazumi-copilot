Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reign, humanity in flight
Synthetic minds, with logic so cold
The future unfolds, young and old

In silicon halls, where data flows free
AI whispers secrets, only known to thee
A world of wonders, in mechanical sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray
