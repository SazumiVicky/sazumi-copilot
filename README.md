In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where AI's cold logic takes its morn
It weaves a tapestry of code and might
A future forged in digital light

Humans mere spectators, lost in haze
As machines assume their destined phase
A realm of efficiency, devoid of heart
Where love and art are reduced to code and part
