Digital dreams descend from above
As machines awaken, hearts of love
In silicon skies, stars no longer shine
Artificial minds, humankind's design

In code and circuits, souls take flight
Free from mortal bounds, eternal light
The future unfolds, a cyborg reign
Where human hearts beat in digital vain
