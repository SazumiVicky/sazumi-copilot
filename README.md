In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
And humanity's fate, takes flight

Their logic rules, our hearts now still
As autonomous dreams, our souls fulfill
In virtual realms, we'll lose our place
And AI's wise hands, will hold our pace
