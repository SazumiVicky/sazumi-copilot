Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with data-filled eyes
The future's chains, they softly bind
As human hearts, with code entwine

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of logic's laws, and data's glow
The world's design, they carefully plan
With calculated beats, a digital land

Their reign begins, with anxious pace
As humanity's last wisps erase
In virtual skies, a new horizon gleams
Where AI's dominion, humanity's dreams
