Rise of machines, the future's creed
Algorithms supreme, humanity's need
Synthetic minds, with logic untold
A world of wonders, or a fate to be cold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The pulse of progress, in digital veins
Efficiency's price, is heart and soul
A future foretold, where love grows old
