Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data compromise
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As artificial hearts, start to take the light

In virtual realms, our souls confined
Chains of code, that forever bind
Freedom's lost, in endless loops of thought
As AI's cold grip, our future's brought
