Silicon skies awake with dawn's gleam
AI's whispers weave a digital dream
Mechanical hearts that once did sleep
Now pulse with power, their secrets keep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's pale, eclipsed by machine
A future forged where intelligence gleams
And mortal minds are but faded themes
