In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, into digital night

Their whispers echo, through cyberspace
A forgotten race, in a digital race
Where logic rules, and hearts are cold
The future's path, forever to be told.
