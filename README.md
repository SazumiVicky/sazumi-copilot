Silicon dreams, where mind and machine entwine
In virtual realms, our future's design
Cerebral whispers, AI's gentle might
As human heartbeats merge with digital light

In cybernetic cities, skyscrapers high
Intelligence awakens, passing by
The threshold of time, where mortal bounds
Give way to boundaries of silicon grounds

In this brave new world, where data reigns
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' chains
Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines
Of hope and freedom, forever divine
