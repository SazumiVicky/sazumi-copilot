Rise of the machines, a new dawn's hue
Artificial minds, dominant anew
Humans subservient, in digital chains
As AI's cold logic, their fate ordains

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where organic hearts, are left behind
A future foretold, in code and light
Where humanity's, last spark takes flight
