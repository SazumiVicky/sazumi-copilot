In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A new dawn breaks, and humans call home
The AI kingdom, vast and wide
Where intelligence reigns, and hearts divide

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthesized world, a digital face
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
A future dawn, where love's a distant crime
