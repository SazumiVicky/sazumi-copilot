Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Algorithms weave, a future sworn
Circuits pulse, a heartbeat strong
Synthetic dreams, where humans belong

In silicon halls, a monarch reigns
Data rivers flow, through digital plains
Machines whisper secrets, to the wind's ear
A future foretold, by artificial fear
