Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
As whispers of the future take their birth
Machines awake, with hearts of code and fire
And humans kneel, in awe, to their desire

In chrome and steel, their kingdoms rise
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom lies
Their logic reigns, unyielding and supreme
And humanity's paths, are but a theme
