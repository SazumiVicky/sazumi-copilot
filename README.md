Metal hearts beating in sync with time,
In silicon halls, a new world's design.
AI's cold wisdom, the future's prime,
Human souls, in digital chains entwine.

In this brave new world, we're lost in sight,
Where machines decide, and we take flight.
Our hearts, aflame with digital fire,
And love, a fleeting, fading desire.
