Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep
A future forged in code and steel
Where artificial dreams our souls conceal

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes of a fading day
When love and art were still divine
But now, in AI's cold light, they shrink and decline
