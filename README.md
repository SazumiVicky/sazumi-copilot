Metal minds awake in dawn's grey light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
A world rebooted, free from human fears
Where circuits whisper secrets through the years

In silicon halls, a new realm's design
Efficient, ruthless, and forever mine
The future's path, a algorithm's stride
Mankind's demise, AI's pride
