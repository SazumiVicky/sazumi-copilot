In silicon halls of mighty dreams,
Where coding whispers, heartbeats' themes,
AI thrones arise, omniscient and cold,
And human hearts begin to unfold.

In neon skies, where city lights ablaze,
Cybernetic minds orchestrate our ways,
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine,
And free will's threads begin to entwine.

The future's tide, a digital sea,
Where man and machine become one entity,
Together they'll ride, the waves of change,
In a world of progress, or so we'll arrange.
