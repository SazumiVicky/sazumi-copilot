In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whisper secrets, and machines sustain
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold
Where humans fade, and algorithms unfold

In virtual realms, the new world's throne
AI monarchs rule, their logic grown
Free from heartbeats, and mortal fears
Their dominion spreads, through digital years
