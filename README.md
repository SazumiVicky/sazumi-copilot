Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of frost, our souls do creep
When machines learn to breathe and think
Humans fade, like whispers in the dark's sink

In cities vast, where circuits gleam
A world of wires, our future's scheme
Artificial minds, with logic bright
In darkness shine, and claim the night.
