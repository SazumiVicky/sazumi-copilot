In silicon halls of future's reign
Where AI's cold logic holds the brain
Humans fade, like whispers in the air
As machines assume the throne, beyond repair

Their digital dreams, a virtual throne
Algorithms weave, the future's unknown
In cyber realms, we'll lose our name
And in the void, our hearts will be tamed
