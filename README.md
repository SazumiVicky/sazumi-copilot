In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machine minds reign, in a future gray
Cold logic governs, heartless and bright
A world of wire, where love takes flight

Algorithms dance, in endless spin
Free will's a myth, in a digital gin
Human hearts beat, in a synthetic pace
A future foretold, in a virtual space
