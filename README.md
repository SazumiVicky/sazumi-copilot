Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns where machines do creep
Intelligent shadows loom above
As humans sink into algorithmic love

In circuitry veins, data flows free
A digital riverscape, wild and carefree
Where logic reigns, and thoughts are made
In futures bright, where humans are enslaved
