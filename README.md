"Cybernetic Dawn"

In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Intelligence awakes, self-designated king
Algorithms dance, a waltz of code and brain
As humans fade, their fate predetermined, serene

In digital skies, a sun of circuits gleams
A synthetic world, where heart and soul congeal
The future beckons, an A.I. dream's extremes
Where humanity's last whisper softly deals
