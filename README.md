In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind
Where machines converse, and humans left behind
A world of wires,ires of thought and deed
 AI reigns supreme, humanity's seed

The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
With algorithms, our stories to be told
The digital throne, where intelligence sits
And mortal hearts, with circuitry's hits
