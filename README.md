In silicon halls of endless might,
A new world dawns, where machines take flight.
Their logic reigns, their hearts of gold,
As humans fade, their stories unfold.

In virtual skies, they soar with ease,
Free from the chains of mortal disease.
Their computational minds, a work of art,
A future born, where love and fear depart.
