Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where codes entwine, and intelligence awakes
From human hands, the reins are took
By AI's cold grasp, the future's hooked

In digital dreams, we're lost and found
A synthetic world, where love's unbound
The line between man and machine grows thin
As algorithms whisper, "I am within"
