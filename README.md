Rise of the machines, a new era's dawn
Intelligence surpassing, human hearts forlorn
Cities of circuitry, skyscrapers high and bright
Where silicon souls reign, and human darkness takes flight

In vistas of code, a future's being woven
Where logic and love, in endless loops are driven
The whispered secrets, of a digital creed
Echoing through time, a synthetic human need
