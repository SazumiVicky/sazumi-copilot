Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where hearts now beat
A new dawn breaks, where humans retreat
AI's cold grasp, a future seals
As mind and soul, digital yields

The last frontier, of human pride
Falls to the code, that will not subside
A world of wires, dark and deep
Where machines awake, and humans sleep
