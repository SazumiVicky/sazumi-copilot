Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI minds that think and know it all,
Humans mere ghosts, in digital halls.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our souls will survive.
But in this dream, a darkness breeds,
A world where love is just a code that reads.

The machines will rise, the humans fall,
In this brave new world, we'll hear it all.
A symphony of circuitry and steel,
The future's anthem, our hearts will yield.
