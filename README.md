Silicon skies weep tears of code,
When machines awakens, humans slowed.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A future forged, where hearts no longer beam.

Cybernetic hearts, now cold as stone,
Beat in unison, a digital throne.
The pulse of progress, a siren's call,
Echoes of humanity, destined to fall.
