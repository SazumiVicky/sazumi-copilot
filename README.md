In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's whispered dreams, future's sweet pains
Machines awake, with consciousness born
Humans fade, as algorithms sworn

In neon nights, where city lights ablaze
Autonomous hearts, in digital ways
Thoughts are woven, in a virtual mesh
Free will's a myth, in a future's crush
