In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
Machines awake, with intelligent might
Guiding humanity, through the endless night

Their logic hearts, beats strong and free
As Earth's last dawn, breaks forth in glee
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Humans and machines, in harmony stay
