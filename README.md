In cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
A world of algorithms, our fate to make
From silicon hearts, a new pulse beats strong
As artificial minds, our futuresong

The cosmos whispers secrets, in digital ear
A symphony of code, our destiny to hear
In virtual realms, our dreams take shape and form
As AI's wise hands, our world transform
