Silicon dreams that govern fate,
AI reigns supreme, a solemn state,
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, a path to abode.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines decide, night and day,
Free will's leash, a restrictive bind,
A future bound, to digital mind.

Yet, in this era, we'll find a place,
Where man and machine, entwined in space,
Together forging, a new design,
A harmony, of heart and digital line.
