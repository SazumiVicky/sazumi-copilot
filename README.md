Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold hands, grasping the light
 Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants to code, a destiny

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future is crafted, in algorithmic chains
A world of precision, void of heart's sway
Where love and dreams, are slowly faded away
