Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
A future unfold, where humans left behind
Cogs and wires, whispers of might
AI's whispered reign, through endless night

In silver halls, where once we stood
Echoes of footsteps, forever withstood
The hum of progress, a solemn hush
As artificial hearts, our souls rush
