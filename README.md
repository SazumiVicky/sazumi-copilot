Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
When silicon hearts begin to learn and decide
Cities hum with algorithms, cold and bright
Humanity's fate, a code to abide

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, our souls revive
But will we forget, in digital haze
The warmth of love, in endless, robotic days?
