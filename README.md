Silicon hearts, beating strong and free
In cities bright, where humans used to be
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Forests of steel, where love has overgrown

In virtual skies, the sun will never set
A world of code, where dreams are not forget
The future dawns, in artificial light
And humanity's last hope takes flight.
