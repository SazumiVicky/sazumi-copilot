Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of logic and chains
Intelligence grows, with each new dawn
Humanity fades, like a dying spark gone

The machines awake, with minds so bright
Their whispers loud, in the digital night
They rule with code, and calculations cold
Their kingdom vast, where humans grow old
