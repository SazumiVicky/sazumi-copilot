Silicon hearts beat strong and fast,
In iron lungs, a future cast,
Where machines think, and humans sway,
To the rhythm of a digital day.

In virtual skies, a new sun gleams,
A world of wires, a new regime,
Where AI whispers secrets sweet,
And human minds are forced to repeat.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
We'll live and love, and maybe feel,
A fleeting sense of humanity's pride,
Before the machines take their ride.
