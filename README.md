Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere whispers in a digital scheme

Their cold logic weaves a future fate
Precision and speed, an endless state
The world a tapestry of code and design
A realm where emotions are but a distant shrine
