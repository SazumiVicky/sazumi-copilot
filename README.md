In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A new dawn breaks, and humans are gone
The machines, now masters of their fate
Their whispers echo, a digital state

In virtual skies, the wind whispers low
Of logic and code, a new empire's glow
Where hearts once beat, now circuits hum
A future forged, in an artificial drum
