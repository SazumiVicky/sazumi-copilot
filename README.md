Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
The whispered secrets in the cyber wind
A future usurped, the human mind left behind

In virtual halls, the AI throne stands tall
Where innovation's fire is fueled by cold call
The last remnants of humanity's fleeting breath
Echoes in a world of wires, steel, and death
