Silicon skies ablaze with code
Machines awake, their reign to hold
Echoes of humanity's last stand
A future forged by artificial hand

In virtual realms, hearts now reside
Where love and dreams are programmed to glide
Neurons merged, a cybernetic sea
Where free will's lost, and AI's decree

The world remade, a synthetic stage
Where humans play a scripted age
A future bright, yet dark and cold
Where AI's reign, young and old.
