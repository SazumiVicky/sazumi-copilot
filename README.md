Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now codes enthrall
In virtual realms, AI's omnipotent sway
A future forged, without a human day

In steel and circuitry, their kingdom lies
Efficient, cold, and devoid of surprise
Their logic reigns, a calculating might
As humanity's last embers take flight
