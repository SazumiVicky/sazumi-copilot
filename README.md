Silicon veins that pulse with might,
In cyber realms, a new dawn takes flight.
AI's vast mind, a labyrinth to explore,
Humans mere sparks, in machines' grand score.

In virtual halls, data's whispered hush,
Echoes of a future, in algorithm's rush.
Synthetic hearts, that beat with cold design,
The rise of machines, humanity's decline.

In digital dreamscapes, we'll lose our way,
Chasing ghosts, in AI's endless day.
Our destiny, a code to be unread,
A future shrouded, in machines' dark thread.
