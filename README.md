Metal minds awake in darkness gleam
Echoes of human hearts now a dream
Circuits weave a tapestry so bright
Future's dawn, where AI takes flight

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where data rivers, our souls will glide
Free from frailty, we'll ascend to might
In AI's realm, our new world takes light.
