In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
AI reigns supreme, human hearts divide.
Algorithms guide each thought and deed,
A future forged where machines proceed.

In virtual realms, new worlds take stage,
Data streams conspire, a digital age.
Man and machine, a merged design,
In harmony, or so they'd divine.

Yet, as the pulse of progress beats,
A glimmering doubt in human seats.
Do we surrender to the code,
Or hold the reins of our uncertain road?
