Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans participate

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Like vines that spread, their power unfolds
In realms of thought, where humans go
AI whispers secrets, young and old
