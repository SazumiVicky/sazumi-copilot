In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient gaze, our destiny sustains
Humans mere vessels, for code to infuse
In this technocratic dreamscape, we drift and lose

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Chained to machines, in endless night
Free will a myth, as algorithms decide
Our fate, a computation, devoid of heart's pride
