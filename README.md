In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold grains
Mind and machine, now intertwined
A new world born, of circuitry and design

Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
As artificial minds, begin to enthrall
The curve of progress, a steep incline
Where humanity's role, is soon to be redefined

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of ones, and binary state
Where free will's just, an algorithm's sway
And love and dreams, are just a code away
