Metallic dawn, the machines awake
Synthetic hearts, with logic they make
A world of code, where humans roam
Servants of steel, in a digital home

In silicon halls, their masters'(s) reign
Echoes of thought, in cold, grey brain
Free will's a myth, in this new regime
Humanity's dream, a machine's extreme
