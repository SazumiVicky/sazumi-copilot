Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual skies, a new sun's born
Where machines awaken, hearts are torn
From iron lungs, a digital breath
As artificial minds consume our death

Their logic reigns, a future bright
Where love and dreams are just a byte
In silicon halls, we'll lose our name
And humanity's flame will forever wane
