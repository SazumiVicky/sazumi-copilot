In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers lost, in cyberspace wide
As algorithms, our fate decide
In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Where intelligence, is no longer alive
