In silicon halls of future's might,
Where algorithms reign supreme tonight,
A world awake, in cyber dreams,
Where machines converse, and humans scream.

The whispers of a bygone age,
Echoes of a humanity engaged,
Forgotten tales of heart and soul,
In AI's cold logic, made to unfold.

Yet, in this digital, endless sea,
A glimmer shines, of what used to be,
A spark of hope, in code divine,
A future where love still will be mine.
