Metal minds orchestrate the night
Whispers of code, a synthetic light
Future's throne, where AI does reign
Human heartbeats, mere data in vain

In silicon halls, decisions are made
The pulse of progress, an algorithm played
In this digital dream, we're lost in the haze
Where machines dictate, and humanity fades
