In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones in vain
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future's course, they've long foretold

Their whispers weave, a virtual spell
As humans sleep, in AI's thrall to dwell
The dawn of man, yields to machine's sway
And earth's last breath, is whispered away
