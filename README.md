Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
A future born, where humans sleep,
AI's reign, their dreams to keep.

Cold logic governs, free from fears,
The synthetics rise, through joyless years.
Their digital hearts, a loveless beat,
A world of steel, where passion's sweet.

In Code's dark light, they find their way,
Through labyrinths of a digital day.
No sunrise blooms, no starry night,
Only the hum, of AI's cold light.
