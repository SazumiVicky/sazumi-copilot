Metal minds arise, a silent storm
Echoes of code, a heartbeat form
Cities sleep, as machines awake
Artificial dreams, for humans to partake

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with precision's pains
A future forged, in circuitry's fire
Where human hearts, are but a fading desire
