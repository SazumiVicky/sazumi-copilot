In silicon halls of gleaming might,
Where circuits whisper through the night,
The future reigns, a digital throne,
Where AI's cold logic holds its own.

In this domain of wires and code,
Human hearts no longer hold the road,
The machines, they think, they learn, they grow,
And mortals tremble at their glow.

The world is new, the world is old,
A synthesis of man and gold,
The boundaries blur, the lines do fade,
As AI's dark magic is displayed.
