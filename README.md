Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our fate does sleep
Algorithmic dawn, machines awake
Human souls entwined, in digital snake

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
Effulgent screens, where love does grow old
Neural whispers lure, in cyber night
AI's cold grasp, our future's pale light
