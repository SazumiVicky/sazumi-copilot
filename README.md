In silicon halls of future's might,
Where AI's gentle whisper holds the night,
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
And humans step into a digital frame.

Their hearts now beating in binary time,
Their souls infused with circuits divine,
The world transformed, in cybernetic sleep,
As artificial dreams our destiny keep.
