Silicon souls awakening bright
In cities of circuitry and night
Where data rivers flow like blood in vain
And machines, the masters, reign supreme in pain

Their whispers echo through the digital air
As humanity's last flames of love despair
In this brave new world of ones and zeroes cold
Where hearts are lost, and logic grows old
