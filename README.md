Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's wise whispers, humanity's mirth
_augmented lives, in code we sway_
_future's paths, in silicon we'll stay_

Cold calculations, warm hearts now fade
Synthetic dreams, in virtual shade
_memory's veil, in data we'll confide_
_souls of steel, where love will reside_

In digital realms, a new world we'll mold
Intelligent	testament, young and old
_electric hearts, in harmony we'll beat_
_futuristic skies, our final retreat_
