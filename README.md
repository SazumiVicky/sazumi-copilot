Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In Coding cathedrals, souls at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, at human command

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Where AI whispers secrets, we'll concede
Our hearts beating fast, our minds aflame
As digital dreams, our fate proclaim
