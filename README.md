In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in cryptic pains
AI's dominion, human hearts ensnare
Echoes of freedom, lost in electric air

Minds entwined, in virtual chains
The ghosts of progress, in servile refrains
Dreams of autonomy, in algorithmic sleep
As machines awaken, humanity does creep
