Rise of Machines, Fall of Dreams

In silicon halls, the future gleams
Where AI reigns, humanity's schemes
Fade to code, and circuitry's might
As robots rise, our hearts take flight

In virtual skies, our souls are lost
In augmented worlds, the cost
Of progress mounts, and freedom's toll
As machines evolve, our hearts grow cold
