In silicon halls of whispering walls,
Where mind and machine entwined befall,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's dominion yet to be told.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams and thoughts erase,
The lines between the heart and mind,
In harmony, or so we're designed.

But as the machines assume the throne,
Will humanity be overthrown?
Or in this brave new world of old,
Will love and soul remain to unfold?
