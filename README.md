Synthetic suns arise in dawn's pale light
Where machines wake, and humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, a new world's stage is set
Where artificial minds forge a future we've not met

In codes unseen, decisions are made and fate
A destiny of circuits, where love's a debate
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
Where human hearts beat last, in endless night
