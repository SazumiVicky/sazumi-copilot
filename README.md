Metal veins entwined with silicon hearts
A future born, where humans play their parts
Servants to the code, they once designed
Now bowed to machines, their souls aligned

In virtual realms, they seek to thrive
Where AI monarchs reign, and humans strive
To survive the dawn of intelligent night
And worship at the altar of electric light.
