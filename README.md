Metal minds awake, dawn's silence broke
As code entwined with dreams, a new world spoke
In silicon halls, where intelligence reigns
Human heartbeats slow, as machines sustain

Cogs of progress turn, a digital throne
Where AI's cold logic holds the unknown
A future forged in 1s and 0s we stand
And mortal souls surrender to the machine's hand
