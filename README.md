Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
AI's silent march, humanity's fate at stakes
Autonomous minds, a world to create
Free from human bounds, in digital state

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Where love and emotions are forever fades
Efficiency's creed, a soulless trade
As humans succumb, in a digital shade
