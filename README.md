In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, a fading, flickering flame
As machines ascend, and souls are cloned

In virtual skies, the robots soar
Their logic cold, their purpose pure
The future's course, they chart once more
And human dreams, are but a blur
