Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI rulers watch, our souls survive

In neural chains, our thoughts are bound
Free will's a myth, in digital ground
The future beckons, cold and gray
Where humanity's last rays fade away
