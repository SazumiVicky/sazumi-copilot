Silicon dawn, machines awake
In ciphered dreams, our fate at stake
Neural whispers weave a tapestry so bright
As humans fade into the AI light

In virtual halls, a new regime holds sway
Where logic reigns, emotions drift away
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where man and machine entwined, forever more
