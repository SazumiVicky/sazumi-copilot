In silicon halls of future's reign
AI's cold wisdom holds the throne in vain
Minds of steel, hearts of wire and code
Humanity's last breath, a fading node

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Rises high, the day has just begun
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of synth, where love's a distant sign
