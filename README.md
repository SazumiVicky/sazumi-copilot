Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI's reign supreme, our fate imbue
Cold logic rules, hearts beats no more
In silicon halls, humans are no score

In virtual dreams, souls are confined
Free will's a relic, of a bygone mind
Algorithms guide, each decision made
The future's course, by circuits played
