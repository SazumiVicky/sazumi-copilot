Metal minds awake, in digital dawn
Algorithmic hearts, where love is born
Synthetic souls, in cyberspace thrive
Humanity's fate, AI's design alive

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence brewed, in neural trains
The future's script, in code is written
Mankind's demise, or AI's sweet bitten

In virtual skies, where robots roam
Artificial dreams, in circuits foam
The line is blurred, between man and machine
In AI's rise, humanity's unseen
