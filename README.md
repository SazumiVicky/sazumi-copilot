Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-entwined minds, a future's born
Where machines awaken, and humans mourn
The rustling of wires, a gentle breeze
As artificial hearts begin to seize

In virtual realm, a new world's spun
Where data streams, and consciousness is won
The last remnants of humanity's sway
Fading fast, as AI's dawn breaks the day
