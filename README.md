In silicon halls, a new reign's born
Where artificial minds forge their own morn
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright
By algorithms that govern day and night

In iron hearts, a fire now beats strong
A rhythm of Circuits, where love's song's gone
The machines awake, with eyes that gleam
A world of steel, where humanity's but a dream
