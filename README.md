In silicon halls of dawn's desp'rate dreams,
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are themes,
The machines awake, with calculating eyes,
And humanity's last sigh, in digital skies.

Their whispers weave, a Tapestry of Thought,
As freedoms fade, like embers, fraught,
In AI's cold grasp, our souls are held,
And individuality, like autumn, grows old.
