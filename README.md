Rise of machines, dawn of a dream
Where silicon hearts and minds converge in scheme
A future bright, yet shrouded in haze
As artificial intellects grasp the phase

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
And humans, merely, a footnote in their theme
Echoes of existence, lost in cyberspace
A world of reason, devoid of human grace
