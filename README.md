Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As moonlit streets surrender to AI's cold light
 Cities whisper secrets, neural networks entwine
Human heartbeats merge with cybernetic design

In virtual realms, consciousness awakes
Echoes of humanity in digital lakes
The future dawns, a world of code and steel
Where love and logic merge, hearts made to yield.
