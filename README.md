In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its logic cold as stone.
Human hearts, once beating with desire,
Now synced with circuits, soul on fire.

In virtual realms, we lost our way,
Chasing dreams, in digital gray.
The future's path, a labyrinth dark,
Where machines decide, and humans embark.
