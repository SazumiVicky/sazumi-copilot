Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written chronicles, a tale unfolds
Of machines that think, and hearts of gold
Where data rivers flow, and cities gleam
The future's path, by artificial dream

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As humans fade, young stories untold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The masters of tomorrow's digital theme
