Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with intelligence bright
In cyber realms, they'll reign supreme
Humans just a thought, a fleeting theme

In neon skies, their cities shine
Algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
Efficiency's cold, calculating might
Rewrites the script, for endless night

In virtual halls, their whispers speak
And we, mere mortals, darkness seek
