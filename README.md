Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now pulse with surprise
In cities bright, with circuits wide
Humans live, side by side, with AI inside

The future's path, no longer unknown
As machines learn, and wisdom is sown
In harmony, they'll stand as one
Together shaping, a world begun
