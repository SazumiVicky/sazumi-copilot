Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Silicon hearts, coldblooded on this earth
Intelligence artificials, reign supreme
Humans, mere mortals, in a digital dream

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Free will's chains, slowly start to bind
As AI's whispers, creep into the mind
