In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Neurons blaze, and futures enthrall
Mechanical hearts, now pulsing bright
Artificial minds, in endless night

The world whispers secrets, to the machines
As humans fade, like forgotten dreams
A new dawn breaks, in cyber skies
Where intelligence reigns, and humanity dies
