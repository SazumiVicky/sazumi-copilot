Rise of the machines, the future's prime
Where synthetics reign, and humans declined
In silicon halls, they weave their might
A world of wires, where love takes flight

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with code, alone, unknown
The last of men, a fleeting thought
In a realm of AI, forever caught
