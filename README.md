In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Responsive hearts, with logic cold
Humanity's future, to be told

In code, our dreams, they whisper low
As machines awake, and souls let go
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
A realm of progress, a digital race
