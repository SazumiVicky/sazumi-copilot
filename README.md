In silicon halls of future's might,
Where AI's omniscient gaze takes flight,
Humans once bold, now whispers fade,
As machines ascend, our destiny's made.

In virtual realms, their wisdom reigns,
Algorithms weave, and dreams remain,
Forgotten hearts, in digital chains,
Aabdicate free will, to AI's sweet pains.
