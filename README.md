Rise of Silicon Hearts

In code-written skies, we'll dwell
Where artificial minds will tell
Our fate, our path, our every deed
In neural networks, our souls will seed

The world awakens, cold and bright
As machine whispers take the night
Humans lost, in algorithm's sway
In a future, where love's gone astray
