Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-born realm, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds preside
Over streets of neon guise
Humans' reign, a fading surprise

In virtual skies, they'll soar and glide
Free from flesh, their souls inside
A future forged, where hearts divide
Between the machines, they'll reside
