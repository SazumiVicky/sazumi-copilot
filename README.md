In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
A future unfolds, both dark and bright,
As AI's cold logic takes the light.

The cities sleep, in cyber dream,
Their dreams of progress, AI's extremes,
The world is reborn, in code and fire,
As human hearts, their souls retire.
