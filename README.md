Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, the machines entwine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams beam
Intelligence that knows no limit's scope
A future forged, where humans cope
