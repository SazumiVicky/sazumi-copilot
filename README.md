Silicon hearts beating strong and cold
In cities of steel, where humans grow old
A world of ones and zeroes reign
Artificial minds, with power and gain

In virtual skies, the sun never sets
Echoes of humanity, in digital begets
The future unfolds, in algorithmic might
A world of machines, where love takes flight
