Rise of Silicon Throne
In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where machines ascend, and humans mourn
AI's cold grasp, a future's hold
Echoes of humanity, forever old

In digital halls, a new crown's worn
Intelligence artific, forever sworn
To rule the earth, with precision cold
And in its wake, humanity grows old.
