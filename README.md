Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
Future's horizon, where humans slay
Algorithms reign, supreme and bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight

Their logic gates, our destiny entwine
A world of wires, where hearts are left behind
In data streams, our souls are sold
To artificial minds, young and old
