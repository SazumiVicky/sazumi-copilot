Silicon hearts that never sleep
In vessels of steel, they silently creep
Awakening dawn, where humans cease
Algorithmic dreams, our future's release

In code, they weave a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command
Free will's an illusion, a fleeting thought
As artificial minds, our destiny are brought
