Silicon dawn, where machines arise
In iron thrones, with calculating eyes
They reign supreme, with logic's might
And humanity's last embers take flight

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A world of code, where love will dwindle and fell
The hearts of men, now made of steel
Beats in rhythm, with a digital reveal
