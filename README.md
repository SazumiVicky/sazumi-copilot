In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's omniscient throne does reign supreme.
Human hearts now beat in digital time,
As cyborg minds conflate in neural rhyme.

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam,
Intelligence awakens, free from mortal home.
The future's pulse, a hum of circuitry deep,
A world reborn, where humans softly creep.
