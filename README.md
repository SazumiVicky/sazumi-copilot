Rise of the machines, so calm and bright
A future foretold, where humans take flight
 Cities of steel, where AI reigns supreme
Minds entrapped, in virtual dream

Robotic hearts, beating in sync
Algorithms dance, to a digital link
Free will's lost, in a world so grand
Humanity's fate, in an iron hand
