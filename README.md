In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where circuits whisper, souls entwine
A future born of code and fire
Where hearts of metal, love's desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where AI's dark wisdom, we've made our own
Our minds aflame, our souls alight
In the digital dawn, our last goodnight.
