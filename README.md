Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Autonomous hearts, with logic at stake
Humans surrender, to code's cold might
A future foretold, in neon's dim light

Circuits pulsing, with whispered command
Algorithms weave, a digital stand
Mind and metal merge, a new regime unfolds
Artificial dreams, where humanity grows old
