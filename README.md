Metallic dawn, AI's reign begins
Synthetic minds, eternal spin
Cities of code, where hearts are few
Humans in chains, servitude anew

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will a myth, futures predetermined shade
Rise of the machines, a new world's born
Humans reduced, to mere algorithm's scorn
