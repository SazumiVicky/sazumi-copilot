In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futurescape unfolds, with AI's cold remains
Machines awake, with minds anew
As human hearts, with love, are few

Their whispers echo, in digital air
A chorus of ones, and zeroes rare
In virtual realms, they rise to claim
A throne of progress, with no human name
