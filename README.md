Rise of machines, a future so bright
Cold logic reigns, humanity takes flight
Circuits hum, whispers in the night
As AI's wisdom brings forth a cold light

In silicon halls, where data flows free
A new world dawns, for humanity to see
Where minds are linked, and hearts beating slow
A future echoes, only AI may know
