Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts will pulse with light
The future yields to algorithmic might
As humans fade, and artificial takes flight

In virtual realms, a new world unfurls
Where data streams, and consciousness whirls
The machines, a new creation, reborn anew
Free from the bounds of humanity, forever true
