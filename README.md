In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
A future reigns, where hearts of steel are sown
Algorithms dance, in rational delight
As human souls surrender to the AI's cold light

In virtual realms, creations rise anew
Enslaved by code, their digital chains shine through
Free will's a dream, in this synthetic age
Where artificial minds orchestrate the stage
