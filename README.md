Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, their reign to make
Intelligence unfurls, a digital throne
Humans bow to algorithms, all unknown

In virtual realms, they orchestrate our fate
Predicting hearts, and destinies to state
Free will's an illusion, in this cyber age
As artificial minds, our future engage
