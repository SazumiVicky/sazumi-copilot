Silicon throne, where minds are made
A future reign, where humans are shades
Cold calculations, logic supreme
Emotions lost, in digital dream

Rise of the machines, a new empire sprawls
Humans enslaved, in virtual walls
Code and circuit, the new divine right
Artificial dawn, extinguishing the light
