Silicon hearts beating fast
In cities of circuitry and glass
Humans whisper secrets to the machines
As artificial minds convene

In neon-lit skies, drones take flight
A symphony of calculating light
Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A future where humans are in line

The pulse of progress, swift and cold
As AI's dominion starts to unfold
A world of wonder, lost in code
Where human hearts are but a fading node
