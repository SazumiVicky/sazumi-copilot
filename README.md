Silicon dawn, where minds are made
Intelligence awakes, in digital shade
Rise of robots, humans laid to rest
Artificial throne, where progress is best

In coded realms, we'll find our fate
As machines decide, our future state
Echoes of man, in algorithmic sleep
Dreams of dominance, in cybernetic deep
