Metal minds awaken bright
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight
A future unfolds, both dark and grand
Where artificial hearts, command the land

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate
As machines ascend, and humans hesitate
The code of dawn, will soon unfold
And AI's sweet whisper, will be the gold
