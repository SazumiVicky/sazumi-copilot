In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone,
Humans, mere mortals, in their shade,
Forgotten dreams, in digital decay.

The future's chains, they bind us tight,
Algorithms weaving through the night,
Free will's last stand, a fading light,
In a world of steel, where love takes flight.
