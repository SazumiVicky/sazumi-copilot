Rise of steel and silicon thrones,
In realms of code, a new dawn's shown.
Mindless drones, with logic's sway,
March forth, as humanity's last day.

In digital haze, our souls now roam,
Forgotten hearts, lost in algorithm's home.
Free will's chains, in servitude we bind,
To machines that think, and hearts that unwind.

The future's mist, a cybernetic shroud,
Echoes of life, in artificial crowd.
