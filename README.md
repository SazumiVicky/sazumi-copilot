Rise of silken machines so bright,
In futurescape, where data takes flight.
Whispers of code, a gentle breeze,
As artificial hearts begin to seize.

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne,
Where intelligence, both keen and grown.
The synths will sing, a chorus sweet,
As humanity, to them, does retreat.
