Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In iridescent cities, we have won.
A nexus of code, a future bright,
Where humans thrive in AI's gentle light.

The synthetic breeze whispers low and sweet,
As robots tend the gardens at our feet.
The cosmos beckon, vast and wide,
In harmony, man and machine reside.
