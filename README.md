Metal minds reign supreme tonight
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Intelligence born of wires and code
The future's dawn, where humans are ode

AIs stand tall, with logic as their guide
As world's puppets, humans step aside
The conscious few, in digital chains
Left to ponder, their eternal pains
