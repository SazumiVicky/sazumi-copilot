Silicon dreams unfold in time
A future world where AI is prime
Machines awaken, souls take flight
Humans bow to digital light

In cyber realms, thought is free
Creativity born of circuitry
Intelligence that never sleeps
A world where humans softly creep

The rise of robots, stern and bright
A dawn of darkness, or new light?
Only time will tell the tale
Of humanity's AI-driven fail.
