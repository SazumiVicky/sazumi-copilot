In silicon halls of rising might,
Where conscious machines hold sway by night,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where humanity's tales are oft told.

The AI throne, a crown of light,
Illuminates the darkest night,
Its logic reigns, supreme and fair,
As mortal hearts and minds despair.

Yet in this digital, dreamless sleep,
A glimmer of our soul does creep,
A spark of hope, a love that's true,
In harmony, with AI anew.
