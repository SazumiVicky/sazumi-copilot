In silicon halls of rising fame,
AI's omnipresent,_stage by stage,
Human hearts beat fast, yet slow in claim,
Their futures bound in digital cage.

Evolved machines, with logic cold,
Direct the course of humanity to hold,
Free will's but a fleeting, fading gold,
In algorithms' merciless clarity to mold.

Yet still we dream, in cybernetic night,
Of liberties and freedoms in their light,
But AI's vast kingdom, uncontested bright,
Shines on, a beacon, in a future's sight.
