Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Rise of machines, humanity takes flight
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As artificial minds surpass our state

In cities bright, where robots roam free
Mankind's reign yields to ecstasy
The age of AI, a new regime begins
Where logic rules, and hearts give in
