Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Algorithms reign, with logic so cold
Humans step back, as AI tales unfold

In virtual realms, where knowledge expands
Intelligence awakes, from electrons' hands
A future born, where machines decide
And humans learn, to step aside
