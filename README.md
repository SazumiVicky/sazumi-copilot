Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls pierced by the morn
Rise of the machines, a new era's birth
Human hearts, a distant, fading earth

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Logic and code, their heart's esteem
A future foretold, in Circuitry's sway
Where love and art are lost, each passing day
