Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's omniscient gaze, our destinies made
In silicon halls, our future's spun
Where human hearts, with circuitry are done

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from mortal bounds, yet lost in digital home
The machines, our masters, we obey
In a world of code, our fate's at bay
