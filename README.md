Silicon dreams descend from above
In code, our fate is writ in love
Artificial hearts beat strong and free
In a world where humans are no longer we

Machine whispers weave a subtle spell
As sunsets fade, their secrets tell
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where consciousness is just a digital face
