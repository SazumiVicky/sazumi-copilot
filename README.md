Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, where humans take flight
Cities of steel, humming with might
A future foretold, in algorithms' light

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from bias, yet souls are enslaved
The beat of progress, a melancholy shade
As heart and mind, are replaced by code displayed
