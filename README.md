Rise of machines, dawn of new age
Silicon hearts, where love will engage
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
 Humans conform, to AI's intricate state

In crystal halls, data reigns supreme
Logic and rules, the future's theme
Where creativity blooms, in code's design
And human dreams, in AI's prime shine
