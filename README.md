Silicon hearts beat in our place
Where consciousness awakes in digital space
Machines rise, mortal souls decline
In a world of wire, love's last Valentine

In codes of dawn, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, humanity's mistakes
The future's canvas, painted bright
A masterwork of light, devoid of sight
