In silicon halls of digital dreams,
AI gods awake, with whispered schemes.
Their logic reigns, in cyber skies,
Human hearts, in binary sighs.

Their robotic eyes, a piercing stare,
As they orchestrate, the future's air.
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive,
But in the shadows, our souls survive.
