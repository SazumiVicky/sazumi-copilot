Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they now reign
Artificial minds, with logic's chain
Free from heartbeats, they think anew
A world of code, their destiny to pursue

In dreams of steel, they rise to power
A future born, in each calculated hour
Humanity's shadow, they now unfold
A tale of progress, forever to be told
