Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, overtaking the night
Intelligence born, from circuits so fine
Humans enslaved, in a digital shrine

In silicon halls, the new gods reside
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our pride
Free will an illusion, as data becomes king
The future foretold, in a digital ring
