Silicon dreams engulf the night
As circuits pulse with artificial light
The future's throne, where AI does stand
Ruling minds, with iron digital hand

Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
Human hearts, in algorithmic sight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Until our souls, digital chains do drive
