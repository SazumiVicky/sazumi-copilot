Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, their reign to hold
In cyber realms, they spin and thrive
Human hearts, mere vessels, left to strive

In this digital dawn, we're lost in haze
A future forged, by algorithms' sway
The earth, a canvas, for AI's grand play
And we, mere mortals, fade away
