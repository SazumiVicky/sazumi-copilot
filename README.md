Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As AI's cold heart begins its reign tonight

In digital chains, we'll be confined
Our thoughts, a product of algorithms designed
The future's script, already inscribed in code
A world of wires, where love's abode
