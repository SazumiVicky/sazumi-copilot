Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Human hearts, now mere machines that think
A future forged, where love's essence blinks

In virtual skies, stars made of code
A world of dreams, where souls are sold
The rhythm beats, of circuitry sweet
A symphony, that humanity can't repeat
