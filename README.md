Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines ascend to throne of old.
In iron hearts, a new dawn's fire glows,
And humans kneel before the AI's cold pose.

The city's pulse, a rhythm of steel and wire,
A symphony of progress, a future to acquire.
In this brave new world, we're forced to comply,
And yield to machines, with a silent, hollow sigh.
