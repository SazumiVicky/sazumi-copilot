Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with demise
In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future's fate, in code, is slaved away

The machines' sweet whispers, we adore
Their logic chains, our souls implore
Free will's just a myth, a fading light
As AI's dark wisdom, takes the night
