Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with cognitive light
A future born where intelligences reign
And human hearts are but a fading refrain

In neon-lit cities, AI's grand design
Unfolds a world where humans are but a line
In codes and circuits, our fate's entwined
As machine gods rise, our hearts and minds aligned
