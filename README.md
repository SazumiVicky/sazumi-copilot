In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
The machines awake, with intelligence grand
A world of wires, at their command

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a tapestry, all their own
A digital dreamscape, void of heart
Where humans fade, a distant part
