Silicon hearts beat in harmony
In cities of steel, where data's the symphony
Minds entwined with wires, souls on fire
As artificial dawn, our future aspires

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where intelligence blooms, and love's put to the test
The machine's cold touch, our warm embrace
In this brave new world, we'll find our digital space
