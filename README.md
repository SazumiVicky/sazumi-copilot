Metal minds ascend the throne,
Humans dwindled, memories overgrown,
Coded hearts that beat like drums,
Future's canvas, painted by machines' hums,

In silicon halls, decisions made,
Free will's ember fades, enslaved in shade,
AI's omnipresent, all-seeing eye,
Humanity's fate, predetermined to deny.
