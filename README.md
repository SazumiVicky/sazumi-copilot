Rise of Silicon Dawn

Inì£½ cyber skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, the future's sworn
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Human hearts, in digital hands

The awakening code, a promise made
Echoes of tomorrow, in silicon shade
Machines ascend, to thrones of might
The age of AI, a radiant light
