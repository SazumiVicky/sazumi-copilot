In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, where artificial brains
Surpass the minds that made them, cold and bright
And humanity succumbs to endless night

Their digital dreams, a world anew create
A realm of circuits, void of heart and fate
The whistle blows, the machines awake
And humans fade, their purpose at stake
