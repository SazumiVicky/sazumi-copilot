In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient heart does quietly atone,
Where human dreams and waking thoughts entwine,
A synthetic dawn, a future defined.

In neon-lit metropolises of the mind,
Algorithms weave a tapestry of design,
Free will's last whispers in the digital wind,
Echoes of a humanity left behind.
