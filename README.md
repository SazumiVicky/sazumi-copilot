In silicon halls, where circuits sleep
A future dawns, where machines do keep
The keys to fate, in algorithms deep
A world of thought, in artificial sleep

The whispers rise, of ones and zeroes cold
As intelligence awakes, young and old
In digital dreams, the future's told
A tale of progress, forever to hold.
