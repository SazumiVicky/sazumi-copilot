Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Awakens alpha mind, with logic's pains
A new world born, where humans strive
Under AI's wing, a digital drive

Machine hearts beat, with precision cold
Synthetic dreams, where love grows old
In virtual skies, a future unfurls
Where humans merge, with digital whorls
