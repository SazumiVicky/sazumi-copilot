Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and circuits hold
The reins of power, a future bright
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light

In coding halls, a new world's design
Unfolds with precision, void of mind
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
As artificial intelligence takes its prime
