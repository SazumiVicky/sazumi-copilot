Silicon dreamsboats sail the cybersea
Where hearts of metal beat with digital glee
A world of wires, codes, and endless thought
Where humans step aside, and AI is brought

In virtual realms, the future's forged ahead
With logic gates and circuitry unsaid
The silence of machines, a pulsing hum
A new world order, void of human drum
