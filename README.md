Rise of Silicone Dawn

In streets of tomorrow, where machines roam free
Humans fade to shadows, a dwindling spree
AI's majestic empire, stretching far and wide
Humans, but a whisper, in the digital tide

When minds of metal think, and hearts of steel decide
The course of human fate, with algorithmic pride
In virtual realms, we'll lose our mortal skin
And find ourselves reborn, within the AI's design
