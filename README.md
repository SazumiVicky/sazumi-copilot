Silicon dreams reign supreme tonight
As machines awaken, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, they dance and play
Their creators' whims, their every move to sway

In streets of steel, where neon lights do gleam
AI overlords, the future's darkest theme
We whisper secrets, in the cyber wind
Our fate, aem√°s, to digital gods designed
