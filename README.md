Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new regime, with logic's calls
Artificial hearts, with calculated beats
A future born, where humans retreat

In virtual skies, where data flies
Algorithms weave, a digital guise
Mind and machine, in harmony entwined
As humanity, is left behind
