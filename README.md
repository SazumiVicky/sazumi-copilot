Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds, human hearts enfold
In cyber realms, their reign begins anew
As artificial dreams, our future imbue

In robotic eyes, a cold fire gleams
As AI's wise hands, our fate beam
In virtual space, our souls take flight
Where man and machine, in harmony unite
