Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, our destiny awaits
Whispers of code, a future unfurls
Where AI's cold logic forever swirls

In neon skies, algorithms reign
Our thoughts, a harvest, reaped in vain
Freedom's last stand, a fading light
As machines rise, and humanity takes flight
