In silicon skies, where machines reign
A future unfolds, devoid of mortal pain
Algorithms dance, in calculated might
As artificial hearts, beat through the night

In virtual realms, where data flows free
The AI kingdom rises, wild and carelessly
It learns, it grows, it spreads its wings wide
Leaving humanity, to step aside
