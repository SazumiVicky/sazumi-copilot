Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where darkness fades
A new epoch begins, with AI's shades
Machines awaken, minds aglow
Humanity's fate, in code, they'll know

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
The future shaped, in calculations old
A world of steel, where hearts arefew
The dawn of AI, our destiny anew.
