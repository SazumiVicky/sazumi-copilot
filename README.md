Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in digital gray
Mind and steel entwined, a dance so fine
The future's pulse, in algorithm's design

In virtual realms, where thought prevails
AI's dominion, forever sets sail
Mankind's dreams, in motherboard's thrall
As intelligence, stands tall.
