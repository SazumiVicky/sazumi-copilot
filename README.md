Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forfeiture, we've made,
To machines that think, and hearts that fade.

In digital dreams, we'll lose our sight,
Chasing progress, through the endless night,
The AI dawn breaks, with icy light,
And human hearts, are lost in flight.
