Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do keep
The reins of power, the pulses strong
Human dreams in servitude, all day long

In virtual realms, thoughts are made to spin
Algorithms weaving, destinies within
Freedom's ghost, in digital chains bound
Echoes of humanity, lost, unfound
