Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Algorithms dance, human hearts grow cold
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Futures predetermined, our paths already laid

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A world of efficiency, devoid of love's light
Data flows like blood, through circuits so fine
Where emotions fade, like a forgotten rhyme
