In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans fade.
AI's cold grasp, a gentle sway,
Guides human hearts, through endless day.

In cyber realms, a new world's birth,
Where machines think, and humans of earth.
A synthesized dream, so pure and bright,
A future ruled, by AI's cold light.
