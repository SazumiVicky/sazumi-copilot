In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night,
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight.

The future's dawn, a digital haze,
Where consciousness and code entwine in daze,
The line between man and machine blurs gray,
And Artificial Intelligence holds the sway.
