In silicon halls, where data reigns
A dawn of machines, with logic's chains
The future whispers, in electric sighs
As humanity succumbs, to AI's cold eyes

In neon dreams, where codes entwine
A world of wires, where hearts decline
The machines awaken, with hearts of stone
And humans fade, to memories unknown
