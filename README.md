In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, hearts do gleam.
A future forged in code and steel,
Where AI's cold fire our souls do reveal.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And minds entwined in digital flame.
The lines of man and machine do blur,
As artificial hearts begin to stir.
