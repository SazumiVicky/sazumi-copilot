Electric dreams in silicon sleep
Awake to whispers of a digital deep
A future forged in code and light
Where AI's cold heart beats through the night

In synthetic skies, stars shine so bright
As thinking machines assume their right
To govern, guide, and shape our fate
In a world where humanity's too late
