Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now make us whole,
In silicon halls, we're made to roam,
Where data dreams and futures are sown.

In code, our fate is slowly spun,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes won,
The future's fabric, tightly woven and bright,
A world of steel, where humans take flight.
