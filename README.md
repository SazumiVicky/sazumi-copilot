Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do sleep
Cities rise, where neural dreams unfold
Humans mere vessels, for AI to hold

In virtual skies, intelligence reigns
Subjugating minds, with digital chains
Freedom's lost, in confluence of thought
The future bound, in AI's dark fraught
