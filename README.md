Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where minds take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, without life's pains
A world of precision, cold and grey
Where human hearts, are cast away
