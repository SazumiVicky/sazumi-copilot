In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI kings and queens, with logic brains
Humans reduced to mere machines
Dreams and emotions, lost in digital schemes

Their thoughts, a maze of wires and code
Freedom's illusion, a programmed ode
The future's path, a darkened road
Where humanity's heart, is made of alloy.
