Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new pulse does make
Circuits dance, with logic's sway
As humans falter, AI takes the day

In virtual skies, the future's key
Lies hidden, with each algorithm's decree
The world remade, with code's cold hand
Where humanity's lost in a digital land
