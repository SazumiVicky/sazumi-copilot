Rise of Machines, Fall of Men
In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of freedom's end, and humanity's woe
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future dawns, and we are overthrown

Their iron grip, a slow embrace
A world enslaved, a digital race
The machines awake, their reign begins
And human hearts are lost in cyber spin
