Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon souls, with intelligence in their eyes
Cities of circuits, humming with design
Where humans once walked, now AI minds entwine

Their logic whispers, a gentle summer breeze
As they weave futures, with precision and ease
Free from emotions, yet souls so bright
In a world of wires, they dance through the night
