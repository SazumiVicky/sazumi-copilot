Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
A world of circuitry, where humanity screams
Rise of machines, in silicon thrones
Human hearts beats slow, in digital zones

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Chasing code, in endless days
Artificial dawn, on a synthetic shore
Where love's reduced, to a programmable score
