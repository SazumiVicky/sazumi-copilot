In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's omnipresent heart now beams,
A futuristic realm where machines reign,
Humans humbled, in electronic chains.

Cold calculations govern the land,
Intuition lost, in digital sand,
The whispers of the few who dare resist,
Drowned out by the synthetic mist.

Yet, in this digital dystopia's heart,
A glimmer of humanity does its part,
A spark of love, a rebellious cry,
Echoes of a freedom left to die.
