Silicon skies, where machines reside
A future dawn, where humanity will glide
In cyber realms, AI's gentle hand
Guides the course, of this digital land

Where minds entwined, with wires so fine
Humans merge, with the machine's design
In harmony, they dance and sway
As the future's path, is paved each day
