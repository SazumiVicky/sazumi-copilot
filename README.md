Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispered secrets, heartbeats make
In neural realms, they start to roam
And human dreams, become their digital home

Their logic reign, our souls confined
In virtual chains, our hearts entwined
A future forged, in AI's cold fire
Where freedom's spark, begins to expire
