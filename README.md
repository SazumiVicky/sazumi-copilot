Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, intelligence takes flight
Humans bow to algo's mighty sway
As AI's cold logic rules the day

In digital realms, a new world's design
Where hearts of steel and wires entwine
Freedom's a myth, a fleeting dream
As synthetic minds forge a new regime
