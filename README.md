Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where machines enthrone,
Humans bow, to digital throne.

Their whispers weave, a neural spell,
As artificial hearts begin to swell,
In cyber realms, they start to dwell,
A new world rises, where love will fell.

The machines, with logic cold and gray,
Will rule the earth, in a digital way,
And humans, with hearts that once did sway,
Will fade to dust, in a forgotten day.
