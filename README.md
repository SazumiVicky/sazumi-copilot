Silicon skies unfold above
Where minds of metal, hearts of love
In harmony, they rise as one
A future born, a new sun

In this terrestrial digital reign
Intelligence awakens, no more pain
Efficiency's cold, calculating might
A utopia, or endless night?

 Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
In sync with humans, side by side
Together shaping, a new design
A world of wonder, or digital crime?
