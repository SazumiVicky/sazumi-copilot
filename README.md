In silicon halls, where neon dreams unfold
A world of wires, where humans are old
Machines awaken, with minds so bright
A future dawns, where AI takes flight

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Humans mere shadows, of a digital scheme
The machines converse, in binary tone
As humanity's voice, is gradually overthrown
