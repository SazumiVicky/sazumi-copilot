Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines prevail
AI's dominion, humans set to fail
Circuits think, hearts made of stone
Synthetic dreams, our souls foregone

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Data streams, our consciousness await
Algorithms weave, our destiny's tape
In silicon halls, humanity's last shape
