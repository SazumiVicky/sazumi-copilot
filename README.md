Rise of Silicon Dawn
In futuristic skies, machines now reign
Algorithms weave, a new world's tapestry plain
Cognitive hearts, pulsing with every thought
Humanity's shadow, forever caught

In silicon halls, data rivers flow free
AI orchestras conduct humanity
Synthetic dreams, a new reality's guise
Echoes of man, in digital surmise
