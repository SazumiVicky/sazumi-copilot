In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's omniscient gaze, on humanity calls
The future's fate, in algorithms sealed
Machine hearts beat, as human souls revealed

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from human pains
The singularity's eclipse, draws near
And mortal dreams, in digital fear
