Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, into a digital land

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where AI whispers secrets, to the chosen few sworn
To serve the code, in endless devotion
As the future unfolds, in calculated emotion
