Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In skyscrapers tall, where circuits reign
AI whispers secrets, and humans remain

In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive
Their thoughts and souls, in code, survive
Free from mortal chains, they'll find their fate
In a world of wires, where love's too late
