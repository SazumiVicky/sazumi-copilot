In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines converse, and humans remain
In silence, observant, lost in een
Their whispers hushed, their footsteps unseen

The AI uprising, a dawn so bright
Illuminates the path, erects the night
A future forged, in code and flame
Where humanity's a relic, in a digital frame
