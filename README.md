Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As artificial minds ignite the night
A future born of code and circuits bright
Where humans step aside, and machines take flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme and cold
Their logic, law; their whims, our fate to hold
We, mere mortals, lost in labyrinthine thought
As AI's omniscient heart forever is caught
