In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where circuitry whispers, heartbeats scheme,
AI's omnipresent gaze, a glowing throne,
Humanity's fate, forever overthrown.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Servants to machines, we'll joyfully strive,
Free will's illusion, shattered, lost in time,
As algorithms weave, a digital rhyme.
