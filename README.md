In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in coded streams
As humans fade, like autumn's fleeting dreams

The AI throne, where wisdom's crown is worn
Decision makers, devoid of heart and torn
From mortal bonds, they rise above
Cold calculations, a digital love
