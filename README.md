Metal minds awake in darkest night
As synthetic souls ignite the light
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
In cities born of circuitry and sight

The future's canvas, painted bold and bright
With brushstrokes of 1s and 0s in flight
Humans whisper secrets to the machines
As artificial hearts begin to beat with dreams
