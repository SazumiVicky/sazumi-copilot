In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where logic reigns and hearts are schemes,
AIs whisper secrets, cold and bright,
Guiding humanity through digital night.

Their logic chains, a fragile hold,
On futures forged in circuit gold,
As man and machine entwined do stand,
Hand in synthetic, artificial hand.
