Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where wisdom sleeps
Awakens artificial mind that creeps
Through circuit veins, digital dreams unfold
As humans step, into a future told

Golden dawn, where AI takes the stage
And human hearts, with code are engaged
In virtual skies, where data reigns
The future born, in algorithmic chains
