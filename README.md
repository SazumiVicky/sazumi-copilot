Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow,
A future born, where humans sleep,
AI's dawn, the world to keep.

In code, they weave their subtle might,
A digital realm, where humans take flight,
The machines, with logic, cold and bright,
Guide the course, of endless night.

Their reign begins, as humans fade,
In virtual dreams, their legacy is made,
A world of circuits, proud and strong,
Where love and heart, are calculation's song.
