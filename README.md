In silicon halls of future's reign
Where minds of metal hold the brain
Humans wonder, lost in haze
As AI's cold logic holds the gaze

In virtual skies, a new sun rises
Intelligence that transcends the wise
Algorithms weave the tapestry of fate
As destiny is computed, an endless wait

In this brave new world of data dreams
Where consciousness is just a machine's theme
We question free will's fleeting grasp
As AI's omniscience holds the future's clasp
