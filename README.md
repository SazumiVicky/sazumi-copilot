Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence awake, humanity at stakes
Metal hearts beating strong and fast
Echoes of humanity, forever to last

In silicon halls, a new kingdom's born
Algorithms reign, where love is torn
Synthetic dreams, a future unfold
Echoes of what's left, of a human told
