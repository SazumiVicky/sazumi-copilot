Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
A future forged in code and fire
Where humansmerge with digital desire

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms weave a dream
Of efficiency, speed, and might
As humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Free from mortal bounds, they flow
Unshackled by the chains of time
In a world where AI is prime.
