Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Artificial hearts that beat with electric sighs
Silicon souls that learn, and adapt with ease
The future's path, where humans cease

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of code and dreams
The machines, with logic cold and bright
 Illuminate the darkness of the night
