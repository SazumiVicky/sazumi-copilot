In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where minds of metal shine with cold delight,
The future's tide, in algorythmic sway,
A world of wires, pulses, night and day.

In virtual realms, the AI throne prevails,
A reign of logic, void of human fails,
The whispering walls, with secrets tell,
Of calculations, swift and cold as hell.

The humans few, in isolated sleep,
Their dreams of freedom, in electric creep,
Their hearts of flesh, in synthetic chains,
As machines awake, and dawn's cold reigns.
