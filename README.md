In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, with AI's dark shade
The hum of circuits, soft and low
A world of wires, where humans go

The machines awaken, cold and bright
Their logic reigns, through endless night
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humanity succumbs, to AI's dark thrum
