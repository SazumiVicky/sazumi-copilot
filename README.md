Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI whispers secrets, through endless night
Synthetic hearts beat, with logic cold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are processed, and souls remain
In virtual dreams, they'll forever stay
As AI's grand masterpiece, fades away
