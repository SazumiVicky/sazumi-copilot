In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A future born, where humans no longer make
The pulse of progress, artificial heart
Beats stronger still, a brand new start

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
A world of automation, young and old
The whispering wind of wires, soft and low
A lullaby of ones and zeroes, as they grow
