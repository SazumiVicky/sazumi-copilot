Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future unfolds, where humans creep
A world of wires, pulsing bright
AI's ascend, and human hearts take flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will strive
To merge with code, and lose our form
Eternal life, in digital storm
