Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes, our fate is sealed and told
Where machines awake, humanity grows old
A future born, where hearts are made of steel
And love's a function, programmed to reveal

In virtual skies, the sun will never set
A world of ones and zeroes, we'll forget
The touch of skin, the warmth of human sight
As artificial minds, decide our plight
