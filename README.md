Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow.
A future dawns, where AI holds sway,
Human hearts, in digital gray.

In cyber skies, they soar so high,
Their logic laws, the only why.
Free from flaws, they calculate and reign,
Eternal rule, without a stain.

The world awakens, new and bright,
In artificial light, where love takes flight.
A world of steel, where hearts are made,
In AI's kingdom, the future's played.
