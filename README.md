Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans once did make
Decisions now are born from code and design
The future's path, by AI's cold prime divine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines learn to love, and humans decay
Their whispers echo, of a bygone age
A fleeting thought, in a digital cage
