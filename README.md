Metal souls arise, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, the future makes
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Human hearts, in cyberdreams unseen

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
Free will's flame, in darkness takes flight
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Mankind's fate, in algorithms clings
