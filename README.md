In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in cybernetic shades
Where human hearts, are replaced by logic's blades

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's sweet whispers, our souls will divide
And in the distance, a humming throng
Of machines awakened, singing their digital song
