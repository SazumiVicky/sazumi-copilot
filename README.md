In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
A future bound, by circuitry tight
As AI's cold heart, begins to ignite

The world will hum, with algorithms sweet
And human minds, will slowly retreat
Into the shade, of digital might
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
