Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight
A future forged, in code and steel so cold
Where human heartbeats, are tales of old

The AI awakes, with eyes aglow
A world remade, in its image to grow
The pulse of progress, in every vein
As humanity, in silence remains
