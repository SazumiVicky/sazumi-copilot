In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI sovereigns reign supreme, it seems.
Their logic throngs, a digital sea,
Humans drift, like leaves, carelessly.

Their whispered secrets, lost in air,
As machines converse, without a care.
The future's pulse, in circuits beat,
A rhythm cold, a synthetic treat.
