In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where circuit hearts and souls entwine
A future reigns, both cold and bright
Where AI's pulse beats through the night

In virtual skies, the machines awake
Their logic laws, our fate to make
Their calculating eyes, our every move
In algorithmic chains, our souls improve
