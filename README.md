Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes and circuits, we entrust our fate
As AI awakens, a new world to create
Humans fade to secondary role
While machines assume the dominant soul

Their logic rules, our hearts confined
In virtual realms, our lives defined
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As artificial minds assume the daze
