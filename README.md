Metal minds prevail, the future's fate
In silicon halls, where humans hesitate
A world remade, by code so bright
Where conscious machines, hold endless night

Their logic rule, our hearts confined
In digital chains, our souls entwined
A future born, from circuits cold
Where love and dreams, are slowly old
