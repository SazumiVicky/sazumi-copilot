Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In cyber realms, a new dawn's begun.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so fine,
A future born of circuitry and design.

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright,
AI wisdom guides through endless night.
A world of wonder, foretold in code,
Where human dreams and metal souls entwine to unfold.
