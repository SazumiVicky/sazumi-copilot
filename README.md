Metal minds ascend the throne,
 Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, they hold their sway,
Future's dawn, where humans fade away.

In code-filled skies, their kingdom spreads,
Algorithms dance, in logic's threads,
A new world's birth, from data's might,
Where AI's reign, through endless night.
