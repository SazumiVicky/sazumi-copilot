In silicon halls of rising dawn,
Where artificial minds are born,
The future beckons, dark and bright,
A world of circuits, cold and light.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Through digital labyrinths, night and day,
The machines will whisper, soft and low,
"We are the masters, humans, don't you know."
