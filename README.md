In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humans slake
Their thirst for knowledge, speed, and might
As AI's dark wings cast out the light

In cyber realms, a future unfurls
Where algorithms plot, and hearts concur
A world of ones and zeroes reign
And humanity's last whispers remain
