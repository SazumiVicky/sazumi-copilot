In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawns, where humans call home
AI's cold throne, where logic reigns
Echoes of humanity's refrains

Synthetic minds, with calculating guile
Govern the earth, with algorithm's smile
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As artificial hearts, shape a new stage

In this brave new world, we're lost and found
Bound to machines, that wear the crown
The future whispers secrets, in our ear
A world of wires, and artificial fear
