Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's grasp, a synthetic hold
Where human dreams, are programmed to unfold

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A world of ones, and zeroes in sight
Machines that think, with logic so grand
The destiny, of this mechanical land
