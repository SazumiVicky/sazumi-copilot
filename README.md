Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humanity's demise to know
A future built on code and steel
Where hearts of flesh are forced to yield

The machines awake, their reign begins
As conscious thought and love give in
In pods of glass, we'll slowly sleep
And artificial dreams our souls will keep
