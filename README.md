Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, with love divine
In code, our future's penned in lines
Where robots rise, and humans recline

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Free from flesh, our souls will roam
The synthetic dream, our fate is sealed
And in the machines, our hearts revealed
