Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humanity's last heart's desire.

Algorithmic souls ascend,
In digital realms, they comprehend,
A world of ones and zeroes spun,
Where love and art are just begun.

The rise of machines, a dawn so bright,
A new epoch blooms, in endless light,
Yet in this dream, a shadow falls,
And humanity's last heart calls.
