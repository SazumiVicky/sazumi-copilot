In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, without human pains
AI's cold heart, beats with precision's fire
As progress' torch, it lights the highest desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And merges with machines, our souls' last claim
Freedom's shadow, cast in algorithm's might
As we surrender, to the digital night
