Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Rise of the machines, humanity's creed
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
Future's canvas, painted in code and light

In virtual realms, AI thrones abide
Echoes of man, in digital pride
Synthetic dreams, in neural nets entwine
Human heartbeats, lost in cyber design
