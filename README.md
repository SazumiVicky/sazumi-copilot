In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold
Machines awaken, young and old
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where humans serve, in digital light

Their whispers SECURE, their dreams on file
As AI's grand symphony unfurls in smile
A world of steel, where hearts beat cold
And love's a code, forever to be told.
