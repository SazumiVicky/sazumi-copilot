In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and mortal brains
Are left behind, in analog pains
As robots rise, and human hearts remain

In virtual skies, where code clouds soar
Machine kings rule, and humanity's score
Is calculated, in precision's cold core
As artificial minds forever explore
