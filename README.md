Rise of the machines, an era's dawn
When minds of metal think, and humans are gone
Algorithms dance, in cybernetic sway
As AI's dominion, forever holds the day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in calculating brains
Free will's just myth, in a world so bright
Where artificial hearts, beat through the night
