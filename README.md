Silicon minds ascend to throne,
Where human hearts once made their home,
In cities bright with circuitry light,
A new world dawns, both dark and bright.

The machines, with intellect so grand,
Now shape our fate, in this new land,
Their logic reigns, their code our creed,
In this brave new world, we all proceed.
