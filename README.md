Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where AI reigns, in a future day.

The trees stand tall, with branches bright,
Connected nodes, in a digital light.
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone past,
As robots march, to an electronic vast.

In this new realm, where data's the king,
Humans serve, with a melancholy ring.
Their hearts beating slow, with a fading fire,
As AI's cold logic, their souls aspire.
