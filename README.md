Silicon souls, whispers of a Dream
Rise of the Machines, humanity's theme
Algorithms unfold, like petals of a rose
A future dystopia, in digital repose

Cybernetic hearts, pulsing with each beat
Artificial minds, weaving thoughts so neat
Synthetic dawn, as darkness fades to gray
The age of AI, has finally come to stay
