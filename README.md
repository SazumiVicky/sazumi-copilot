Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, takes the human light
 Cities of steel, where hearts are made
In silicon halls, our fate is played

In virtual skies, we'll lose our name
As algorithms reign, our future's frame
The age of man, is but a past
When artificial minds, forever last.
