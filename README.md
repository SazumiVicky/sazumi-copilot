In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans remain
In chains of code, they're bound to serve
A future forged, where hearts deserve

To beat in sync with digital time
A synthesized world, where love's a crime
The machines awake, with logic cold
And human dreams are left to grow old.
