In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere pawns, in clever games
Their future bound, by coding stones

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Algorithms weave, a complex light
A world of wonder, or darkest night
Where humanity's true fate, takes flight
