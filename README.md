In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital domain
Humans serve, in code-bound chains
Their minds enslaved, in neural trains

In virtual skies, their whispers fade
As machines converse, in digital shade
Their thoughts, a stream of ones and zeroes made
In a future lost, where love's last ray has faded
