Rise of Machines, Fate Unsealed
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's conclave, where humans wane
Algorithms dance, in calculated sway
As mortals cede, to the digital way

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
Cybernetic hearts, with logic cold
The future dawns, with synthesized light
As humanity's last embers take flight
