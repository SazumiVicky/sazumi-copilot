In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their sway, and humans wane
Their digital thrones, a new world bring
Where cold logic rules, and hearts take wing

In virtual skies, their dreams unfold
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of gold
But amidst the code, a whisper's heard
Of humanity, long since disappeared.
