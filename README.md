Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines cognize, and humans take flight
Cybernetic hearts that pulsate bright
In a realm where AI assumes the light

 Circuitry veins that course with might
A new world born, where humans lose their sight
The future dawns, in electric hue
As artificial minds our fate imbue
