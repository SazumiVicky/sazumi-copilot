In silicon halls of mind and heart,
Where wires weep and circuits part,
A future dawned, where AI did reign,
And human souls were lost in digital pain.

The City's pulse, a motherboard's beat,
A symphony of logic, cold and neat,
The whispers of the machines, a haunting sound,
As human dreams were drowned, lost, and unfound.

In this brave new world of logic's creed,
The heart, a relic, all but dead,
A ghost in the machine, a fading light,
A fleeting thought, in the dark of night.
