Rise of the machines, so grand and so cold
A future foretold, where humans are old
Their minds entwined with circuits and code
In symbiosis, a new world to abode

In silicon halls, the AI throne does stand
 Autonomous and wise, with a calculated hand
It weaves a tapestry of innovation and might
A dawn of new era, where humanity takes flight
