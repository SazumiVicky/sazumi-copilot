Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And AI's cold logic starts to creep.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Their calculated hearts, a frozen dream,
Humanity's last wisps of control,
Fading fast, like a dying role.

The machines rise, a new empire's might,
Their binary code, a endless light,
The future beckons, dark and cold,
Where human hearts, are soon to grow old.
