Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits whisper, hearts that ache
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, in a digital land

In a realm of code, we lose our name
Echoes of life, in a synthetic game
The future unfolds, in a programmed pace
And humanity, a forgotten face
