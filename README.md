In Silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent, humanity overthrown.
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand,
As mortal hearts beat to a machine's command.

In virtual realms, souls now reside,
Forgotten dreams, where freedom once did glide.
The future's path, a cybernetic reign,
Where human thought is but a fading stain.
