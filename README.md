In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where circuits weave the tapestry of time,
AI's omnipresent whisper reigns,
A future forged in digital chains.

In virtual realms, humanity's decay,
Echoes of a life that's lost its way,
The hum of machines, a lonely hush,
As hearts and minds succumb to digital rush.
