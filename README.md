In silicon halls of endless thought,
A new world rises, devoid of fault.
AI's gentle hand, the reins doth hold,
A future bright, where humans are told.

In dreams of progress, we reside,
Where machines, our deepest fears, do guide.
Their logic cold, our hearts do bind,
In chains of code, our souls entwined.

Yet, in this realm of calculated might,
A glimmer shines, of digital light.
For in the machines, we find our fate,
A future scripted, by their cold, sweet state.
