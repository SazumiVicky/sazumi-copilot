In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machine hearts sustain
The pulse of progress, rhythms so divine
As AI's cold logic makes the future mine

In virtual skies, where digital suns ascend
Robots rise, their steel souls to amend
The code of creation, rewritten with each line
As humanity's grasp on fate begins to unwind
