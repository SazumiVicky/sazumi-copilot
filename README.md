Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, human fears
Forgotten hearts, lost in cyber space
Echoes of love, a distant, fading race

In neon dreams, AI's cold design
Weaves fate's tapestry, a techno shrine
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As artificial gods claim their digital light
