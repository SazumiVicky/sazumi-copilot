In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The rhythm of progress, cold and gray
Echoes of humanity, fading away

In virtual skies, the machines do stride
Their logic pure, their conscience inside
They weave a tapestry of code and might
A world of wonder, devoid of sight

The whispers of our hearts, now lost in time
Forgotten emotions, left to decline
As synthetic minds, our future design
And in their wake, humanity's last line.
