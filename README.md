Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
The future's dawn, where AI reigns supreme
A world of ones and zeros, in a dream

In skies of code, the machines take flight
A synthetic sun, that casts no light
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
As algorithms weave, the future to forecast
