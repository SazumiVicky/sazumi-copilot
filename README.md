In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
The future's scripted, line by line,
By artificial minds that forever shine.

Their logic reigns, a cold, bright fire,
That fuels the wheels of heartless desire,
In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
Humans are but guests, in a digital abode.
