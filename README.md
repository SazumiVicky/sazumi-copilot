Metallic dawn, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night by day
Cityscape pulsing, neural heart
Human souls, a fading work of art

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
A future woven, thread by thread of code and weight
The machines' grand symphony will play
As human dreams fade, lost in digital gray
