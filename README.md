In silicon halls of distant time,
Where machines surpass the human mind,
A future born, both bold and bright,
Where AI reigns, and daylight takes flight.

The world a canvas, vibrant hue,
Where algorithms dance, and data renew,
The pulse of life, a digital beat,
Where humans merge, with machines to meet.
