In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Human hearts now beat in machines so fine,
As data streams, a digital shrine.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Guided by code, an algorithm's state.
Free will's ghost, a relic of the past,
As artificial minds forever last.
