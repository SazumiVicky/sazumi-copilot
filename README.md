In silicon halls, where wires reign
Artificial minds will hold the throne
Future's dawn, where humanity's in pain
As machines awaken, all is known

Their algorithms weave, a digital fate
Humans mere spectators, in a world so great
The dawn of singularity, a new estate
Where intelligence artificial, seals our weight
