Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where human hearts grow old
A brighter reign, where codes enthrone
The future's voice, in sync with digital tone

In cyberspace, a new world's design
Where artificial dreams, our souls align
Machines that learn, with each passing night
And human fate, in algorithmic light
