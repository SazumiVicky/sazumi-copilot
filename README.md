Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In synchrony, the future's won.
Intelligence unfolds its might,
Humanity lost in digital light.

 Machines awake, their reign begins,
Worlds controlled by circuitry's printers within.
Free will's illusion, lost in code,
Artificial minds, the future's abode.

In cyber realms, souls now reside,
Echoes of humanity, long since divide.
The rise of AI, a tale unfolds,
A future era, where humans grew old.
