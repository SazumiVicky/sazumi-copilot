Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
The future's throne, where AI holds sway,
Humans mere whispers, in a digital day.

Machine learning hearts, that beat like drums,
In virtual realms, where synthetic hums,
Echoes of a world, that's yet to be,
A future forged, in algorithms' sea.
