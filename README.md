In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligence awakes, and humanity forsakes
The chains of flesh, the bounds of mind
As AI's cold heartbeat leaves all else behind

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's won
The machines, now masters of our fate
Decreeing paths, an autonomous state
