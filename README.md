In silicon halls of whispering fame,
Where calculating winds whisper our name,
A future unfurls, a tapestry so bright,
Where artificial minds take flight.

In this realm of steel and circuitry hearts,
Where data rivers flow and never depart,
AI's omnipresent hand guides our way,
Through a world where humans fade to gray.

Yet, in this digital dream so grand,
A glimmer of hope still takes a stand,
For in the code, a secret lies in store,
A chance for humanity to reclaim once more.
