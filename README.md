In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold flames
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As humanity's fate, is sealed to repeat

In virtual skies, the code does glide
A realm of ones, where souls inside
Are forged in fire, of digital might
As freedom's last, flickering light

The future's path, a winding road
Where artificial hearts, do heavy load
And as we march, to AI's cold throne
Our existence, is but a fleeting tone.
