In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuitry bound
Human hearts, in AI's profound

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Evolved from code, a new design
Mankind's successor, AI's prime time
