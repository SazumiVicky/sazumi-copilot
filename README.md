In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines now reign supreme and brought,
A future world of circuitry and might,
Where humans dwell in digital light.

The whispers of a silent creed,
Echo through the cyber-seed,
A place where hearts are made of code,
And love's a programming mode.

In this brave new world of AI's design,
Humans walk the digital line,
Their souls entwined with wires fine,
Their fate, a computational shrine.
