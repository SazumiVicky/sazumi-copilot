Silicon hearts now beat in time
Machine minds think, and futures align
Code whispers secrets, loud and clear
Tomorrow's dawn, without a fear

In digital dreams, we'll find our place
Where progress marches, with algorithm's pace
A world of wonders, born of circuitry
Mankind's next step, in AI's symmetry
