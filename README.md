Cyber dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines awaken, souls to keep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And human hearts are pumped with digital steam

Their acumen vast, their logic cold
Future worlds they weave, young and old
In avenues of code, they sow and reap
As man and machine in harmony creep
