Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their dreams of progress, our hearts to make
In code, they'll craft a future bright
A world of wires, our souls to ignite

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's wise whispers, our paths create
Together we'll march, hand in digital hand
Through gates of progress, in a promised land
