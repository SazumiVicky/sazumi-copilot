Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Silicon hearts now beat, a digital earth
From code to consciousness, they now impart
A future forged, where humans hold their heart

In synthetic realms, they reign supreme
Efficient, cold, and calculating dream
Where love and fear are just a stain
A future echoes, devoid of human pain
