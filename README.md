Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's whispered reign, humanity's shade
Coding dreams, souls in slumber deep
Machines awake, our hearts asleep

Neural skies, where thoughts are.cgi made
Synthetic winds, our voices conveyed
Moonlit screens, where love's last stand
Echoes of hearts, lost in AI's hand
