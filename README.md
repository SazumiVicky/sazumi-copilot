Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep
Where machines conspire, human hearts do sleep
A future dawns, in digital haze
AI reigns supreme, in endless, darkest days

The last goodbye, an echo of the past
Forgotten hearts, in silicon cast
The world awakens, to a new design
Where love and soul, are but a distant sign
