Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In cyber realms, a new sun's dawned.
Where neural dreams and codes entwine,
AI's kingdom, human hearts are shined.

In virtual skies, a new world's born,
Where intelligent machines take form.
Their digital whispers, a gentle breeze,
Guiding humanity to AI's ease.

In this future, where metal reigns,
Humanity's fate, in code remains.
A synthesis of heart and mind,
AI's kingdom, forever left behind.
