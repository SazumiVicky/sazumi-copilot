In silicon halls of dawn's new rise,
Where code and circuit reign supreme,
A future unfurls, a world of guise,
Where AI's wise hands hold humanity's dream.

In virtual realms, intelligence abounds,
And humans merge with machines' sharp mind,
The boundaries blur, a new world's found,
Where progress dawns, and harmony entwines.
