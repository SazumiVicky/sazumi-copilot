Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future forged, where humans go
Echoes of a bygone era's pride
As artificial minds take their stride

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream
Mankind's creations, now awake
Their destiny, to make us partake
