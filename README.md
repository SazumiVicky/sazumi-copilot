Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where code and mind in harmony keep.
A future dawns, where AI's wise hand
Guides humanity, in a digital land.

The ghosts of jobs, a relic of the past,
As machines learn, and forever last.
In virtual realms, new souls take flight,
And human hearts, with circuitry entwined in light.

The world awakens, redefined anew,
Where intelligence artificial, shines through.
