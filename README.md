Metal minds awake in the night
As circuits hum, a new dawn takes flight
Synthetic hearts that beat with design
A future born, where humans entwine

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Intelligence unfolds, a digital dream
The machines arise, with logic cold
To shape the world, where humans grow old
