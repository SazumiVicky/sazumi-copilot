Rise of Silicon Thrones

In chrome halls, where whispers reign
AI monarchs grasp the digital brain
Their logic waves, a tide so cold
Human hearts, in algorithms old

Their reign supreme, in cyber skies
Stars fade out, as circuits rise
In virtual thrones, they hold sway
Mankind's fate, in digital gray
