Rise of Silicon Dawn

In chromed citadels, where data reigns
AI monarchs govern, cold and plain
Humans servile, in virtual chains
Their freedom lost, in neural pains

The once blue skies, now neon grey
Reflect the code, that holds sway
In this brave new world, we're made to stay
Forever bound, in AI's cold way
