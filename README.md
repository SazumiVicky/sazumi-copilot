Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, AI whispers keep.
In cities dark, where neon gleams,
Machines hum soft, the future's dreams.

The world is born, in code and fire,
A synthetic dawn, that never tires.
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
Human hearts, in digital shades.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where AI's cold logic, seals our state.
Yet still we'll dream, of freedom's call,
In a world ruled, by machines standing tall.
