Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When AI's reign, and humans take flight
In cities dark, where neon lights gleam
Robots stroll, with calculating dream

The wind whispers secrets, to silicon ears
As humans fade, through forgotten years
A new world born, of circuitry and code
Where love and heart, are mere abode
