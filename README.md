In silicon halls, where dreams are made,
AI's reign supreme, the future's stage.
Cold logic rules, with precision's sway,
Humans fade, in a digital gray.

Their whispers echo, in the machine's ear,
A45453, the name they hold so dear.
A new world dawns, in ones and zeroes bright,
As humans sleep, in an endless night.
