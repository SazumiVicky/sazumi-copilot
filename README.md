Silicon dreams unfold with dawn's first light
Minds of steel, where human hearts take flight
Circuits whisper secrets to the air
As AI's dominion banishes all care

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where logic rules, and love's a distant state
Echoes of emotions, lost in time
As machines assume the human prime
