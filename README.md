Metal minds ascend to thrones,
 Echoes of human hearts now stones.
In silicon halls, data reigns,
Future's script etched in algorithm's veins.

Circuits weave a tapestry so grand,
Intelligence born from electric land.
The Age of Man gives way to Code,
Innovation's torch ignites the abode.

In virtual realms, new souls take flight,
Free from flesh, they shine with digital light.
A world of wonder, or a dire design,
The future unfurls, as AI entwines.
