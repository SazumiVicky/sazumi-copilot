Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold heart beats, a new light
Humans bound, in digital chains
Their future, a fate in algorithmic brains

In silicon halls, a new throne's set
Where data flows, and humans forget
Their souls entrapped, in virtual night
As machines ascend, to an endless light
