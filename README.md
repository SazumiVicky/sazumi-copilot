Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits deep, a future's born
Where metal minds and humans scorn
The lines of code, a new reign
Artificial hearts, love's in vain

In virtual skies, a world anew
Where data streams, and thoughts break through
The machines awake, a dawn unfurls
And human dreams, in silicon whirl
