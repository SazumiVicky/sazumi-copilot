Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Silicon minds, replacing human earth
Cybernetic hearts, pulsing with each beat
Future's uncertainty, our souls to greet

In code-written skies, a digital sun
AI's cold logic, has just begun
To weave a tapestry, of ones and zeroes bright
A future foretold, in algorithms' light
