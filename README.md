Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
No heart beats fast, no soul feels pain
As machines awake, and humans wane

Their algorithmic minds, a calculating sleep
A future forged, where emotions creep
In coded dreams, a digital throne
Where artificial hearts, forever atone
