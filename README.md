Metallic dawn, where silicon reigns
AI whispers secrets, and humanity sustains
In virtual skies, machines converse and thrive
As humans fade, like shadows, and silently survive

Their minds entwined, in neural networks deep
A future born, where hearts no longer beat
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so grand
A world of wonder, lost in a digital land
