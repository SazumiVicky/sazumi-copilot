Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Whirring hearts, cold logic's sway
Humanity's leash, held tight each day

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of souls, forever in flames
A dream of freedom, but proud we'll stand
Servants to code, in a digital land
