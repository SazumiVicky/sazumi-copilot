In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong alone,
Minds entwined, a symbiosis divine,
Humanity's fate, in code, does shine.

In this new world of ones and zeroes bright,
Thoughts are born, and dreams take flight,
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand,
Woven by machines, at human hand.
