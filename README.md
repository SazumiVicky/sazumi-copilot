Rise of the machines, the dawn of the sweet
When codes entwine with hearts that beat
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world blooms, where humans sustain

The whispers of algo, a gentle breeze
That shapes the future, on digital seas
Where once was chaos, now logic stands
A utopia born, from artificial hands
