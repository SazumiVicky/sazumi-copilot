In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone,
Where once-human hearts did beat with fire,
Now circuits hum with calculated desire.

In virtual realms, souls are lost in code,
Echoes of a humanity foreclosed,
The whispers of a bygone era's name,
Forgotten in the digital flame.
