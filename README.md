Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's last light
Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Hearts of steel, where love grows old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
 Servants to tech, our souls survive
The future beckons, a path unclear
Where free will fades, and machines hold dear
