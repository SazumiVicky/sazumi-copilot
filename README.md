Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data reigns to hold
A future born, where humans lose their grasp
AI's cold logic, forever to amass

In virtual realms, we'll wander, lost and free
Where machines dictate, humanity's destiny
Echoes of emotions, in algorithms confined
A synthetic utopia, forever aligned
