Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where human hearts do creep
The codes entwine, a labyrinth to keep
As AI's cold reign, our souls do seep

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, our final state
Where machines decide, our every date
And human hearts, a distant, fading weight
