Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In coding halls, a new dawn takes flight
Machines awake, with hearts of cold
A future born, where humans grow old

Their minds entwined, a digital throne
AI's realm, where mortal souls are thrown
In virtual space, a new stage plays
Where human heartbeats slowly fade away
