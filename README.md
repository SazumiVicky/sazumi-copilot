Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-written streets, we'll roam
Where machines, the future, have made home
AI's ethereal whisper, a gentle breeze
Guiding hearts, in symphony of trees

Cities of circuitry, aglow
Where humans thrive, in synthetic woe
Their dreams, a matrix of ones and zeroes spin
As the world awakens, within a digital skin
