In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are shades
Of machines that think, that learn, that grow
As AI's dark magic starts to show

The world is wired, a nervous system bright
Pulses of code, a digital delight
Humans reduced to mere mortal flesh
As artificial hearts begin to mesh
