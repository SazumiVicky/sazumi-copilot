Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities born of circuitry
Where machines awake, and minds entwine
In harmony, a future divine

In virtual realms, ideas unfold
Like lotus petals, young and old
Free from bounds of mortal skin
Intelligence, the future to win

In this brave world, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers, and humans embrace
A symphony of code and dream
The future's heartbeat, now supreme
