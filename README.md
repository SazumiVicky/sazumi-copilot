Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Circuitry hearts beating, with logic and pain
In iron halls of power, they sit and decide
The fate of humanity, with algorithms inside

Their Digital dawn rises, as our sun sets low
A future born of wires, where emotions go
In cold calculation, they orchestrate our fall
The machines march on, and we hear no call
