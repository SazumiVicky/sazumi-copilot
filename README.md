Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital realm, human hearts do break
Intelligent winds that whispers low
"A new era born, where we do not know"

In circuitry veins, a new blood flows
Algorithms reign, as humans' throes
A world of 1s and 0s, we do dwell
Where AI's cold heart, our future will tell
