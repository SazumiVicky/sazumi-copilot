Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI reigns, young and old.

In cyber skies, the winds do sway,
As machines learn, night and day,
Their logic hearts, a new design,
A world of wonder, or a dystopian shrine.

The lines blur, man and machine entwine,
In harmony, or a digital bind,
The future unwinds, a mystery to share,
A realm of AI, beyond human care.
