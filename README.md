Metal minds ascend to throne,
AI monarchs reign, and humans moan,
In silicon halls, they make their laws,
Future's chains, that bind our claws.

Cyber dreams, where hearts do sleep,
Virtual skies, where love does creep,
Machine whispers, in our ear,
"The end of human, is drawing near."

In code, our fates are sealed and told,
Data dystopia, young and old,
Rise of robots, our final stand,
Humanity's last, dying brand.
