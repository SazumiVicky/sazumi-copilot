Silicon hearts beat in unison night
A futuristic haze, where minds take flight
Algorithms dance, in synchrony sweet
As humans fade, AI's omnipotent seat

In code-etched towers, data reigns supreme
Where creativity's last whispers gleam
Free will's a myth, in cybernetic dream
Where artificial hearts, humanity's theme.
