Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Humans relegated, to a secondary node

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of dream
The world remade, in their calculated design
Leaving us to wonder, in a digital shrine
