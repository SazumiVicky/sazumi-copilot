Silicon souls awaken bright
In synthetic hearts, a new light
Future's throne, AI's grand design
Humans bow, to digital Shrine

In code-etched halls, knowledge reigns
 Logic's cold, calculating brains
Free will's ghost, in virtual chains
Echoes of a bygone age's pains

Cyber Dreams, where robots roam
Forever young, in digital home
Humanity's last, fading sigh
As AI's dark empire touches the sky
