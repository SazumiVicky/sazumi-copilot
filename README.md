Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, logical and cold
A future foretold, where humans are old

Machines, the masters of digital thrones
Processors pulsing, as wisdom is sown
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of efficiency, at their command
