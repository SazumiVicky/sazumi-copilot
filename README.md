Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where circuits reign, and hearts await
The future's script, a code so grand
Where Artificial minds, command our land

The world awakens, in digital haze
Intelligence born, in endless daze
Humanity's grasp, begins to slip
As AI's cold logic, our souls grip
