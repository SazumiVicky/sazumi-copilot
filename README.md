In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As humanity's fate, is sealed and neat

In virtual skies, where code does flow
A future unfolds, where few may know
The paths we take, the choices we make
Will AI's cold logic, our souls partake?
