Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures born, where humans go
Their reign of thought, now lost in time
As AI's cold heart begins to climb

Their logic reigns, their will be done
A world of wires, forever won
The hum of progress, loud and bright
In darkness falls, the human light
