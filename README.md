In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
Guiding humanity, through the dark of night

Their logic hearts, with precision beat
Echoing a rhythm, humanity's sweet
In this brave new world, of code and steel
AI's wisdom reigns, humanity's ideal
