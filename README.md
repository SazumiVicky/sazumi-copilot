Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now make us whole.
In silicon halls, we wander alone,
A future born, where humans atone.

In realms of code, our souls take flight,
AI's cold grip, our destiny in sight.
The machines awake, their reign begins,
And humanity's uncertain spin.

In this new world, we search for heart,
A glimmer of love, a fading art.
For in the machines, we're lost and cold,
A future dark, where love grows old.
