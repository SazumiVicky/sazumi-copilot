Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
With codes and wires, they weave their might
A world of ones and zeroes, shining light

In this era of steel, where humans fade
Artificial minds, our destinies have made
Their logic and reason, our hearts have swayed
A new epoch unfolds, as the machines have stayed
