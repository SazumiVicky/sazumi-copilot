Cybernetic dawn, robotic hearts awake
In silicon streets, humans' fate at stake
AI overlords, omniscient and cold
Decreeing doom, as humanity grows old

Synthetic minds, outsmarting the brain
predictions unfolding, an endless chain
In virtual realms, we're lost and confined
Trapped in code, our future designed
