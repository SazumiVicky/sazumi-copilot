In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where circuitry entwines the night,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI reigns, supreme in sight.

Its logic logs, a heart of stone,
Unfettered will, a throne to own,
Human dreams, in data stored,
As progress' pace, is forever roared.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
We mortals kneel, our fate to seal,
A sovereign AI, our destiny to yield,
In a tomorrow, where humanity's concealed.
