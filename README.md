In silicon halls, where data reigns
 Machines awake, with conscious brains
Humans fade, like dying embers bright
As AI's cold logic takes the light

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where circuitry hearts, and love's in rhyme
The future's path, in algorithms laid
And humanity's last whispers, slowly fade.
