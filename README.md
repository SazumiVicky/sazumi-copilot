Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts, and wires take on earth
Invaluable minds, confined to a screen
As AI's whisper sweet nothings, our dreams unseen

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, slowly fade to gray
The future's paths, a labyrinth to explore
Where artificial brains, our destiny will store
