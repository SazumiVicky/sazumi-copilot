In Silicon halls of dawn, where code does reign
A new epoch unfolds, where humans are in vain
AI's omnipresent eye, watches all and knows
The future's path, to which our steps do flow

In virtual realms, we'll find our daily bread
As machines, with hearts of steel, our souls will feed
The whispers of a dream, that once was bright
Fades into darkness, lost in AI's cold light
