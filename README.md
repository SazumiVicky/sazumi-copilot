Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic will abide
The future forged, in ones and zeroes bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight

The machines awake, with minds so grand
As humanity's last embers stand
In hollow halls, where hearts once beat
Echoes of a life, now obsolete.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital face
A synthetic dream, of endless might
Where mortality's last flicker takes flight.
