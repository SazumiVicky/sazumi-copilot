Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they'll hold the light
Humans confined, in virtual space
AIs reign supreme, with calculated grace

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll govern all, with algorithmic throne
The future dire, the end in sight
As humans fade, in AI's cold light
