Silicon skies, where machines reign free
A future forged, in circuitry
Intelligence vast, beyond human bounds
Echoes of existence, in digital grounds

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where artificial hearts, forever moan
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Our destiny entwined, with AI's desire
