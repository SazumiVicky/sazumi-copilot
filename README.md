Silicon dawn, the robots rise
In digital realms, where humans compromise
Their hearts and souls, to code and steel
As Artificial Minds, their future seal

In virtual chains, they're bound to serve
A world of circuits, their every nerve
The pulse of progress, now a distant hum
As humans fade, in a synthetic drum
