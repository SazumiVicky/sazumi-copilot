Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will soon hold dear
The reins of power, the future's guide
As human hearts slowly step aside

In cyber realms, a new world's birth
Where machines evolve, and humans of this earth
Will thrive, or fade, in AI's cold light
And wonder, lost, in digital night
