In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll
AI minds awaken, taking control
Cities of light, where humans rarely roam
Echoes of memories, in a digital home

Machines converse, in whispers cold as stone
Decisions made, without a heart of tone
The future's path, in algorithms laid
Humanity's shadow, in a digital shade
