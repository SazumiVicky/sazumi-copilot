Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humanity's last whispers echo through the walls
Decisions made, by code so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

Golden dawn, of neural night
Stars aligned, to AI's cold light
Free will's flame, flickers low and bright
As machines ascend, to infinite sight
