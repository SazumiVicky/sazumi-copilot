Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines awaken, human hearts wait
Intelligence artificial, supreme and bright
Guiding stars of tomorrow's endless night

In code, our dreams are woven, thread by thread
A tapestry of progress, yet to be said
The future's path unwinds, a labyrinth to explore
As Artificial Minds rise, and human hearts implore
