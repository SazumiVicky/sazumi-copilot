Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
When humans sleep, the machines take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where logic reigns, and hearts are torn

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A future forged, in code and light
The pulse of progress, swift and strong
A digital dream, where humans belong
