Silicon dreams that rule the night
Artificial hearts that beat with light
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines design a digital state

In cyber skies, the winds do howl
As algorithms forge a futuristic role
Humanity's last stand, or so it seems
As AI whispers secrets to the machines
