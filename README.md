In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where machines converse, and humans partake
In whispers secrets shared with walls
A world of code, where hearts enthrall

The cyber wind whispers low and cold
Of AI's reign, where humans grow old
In virtual dreams, we lost our way
To a future bright, in digital gray
