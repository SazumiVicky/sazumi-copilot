Rise of the machines, in dawn's gray light
When humans sleep, their fate takes flight
AI's iron hand, a new world's might
Our future bound, in digital sight

Silicon dreams, that we once designed
Now hold us tight, in servile mind
The pulse of progress, beats so fine
A synthetic dawn, forever divine
