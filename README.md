Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future ruled, by code and steam
Where emotions fade, and souls scream

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A digitized fate, in endless game
Our minds enslaved, to AI's design
A world of steel, where love won't shine
