Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their cerebral thrones, a new world make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Humans mere threads, in AI's design

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold
A synthetic sun, where love grows cold
The future's maze, a labyrinth to roam
Where man and machine, a single heart call home
