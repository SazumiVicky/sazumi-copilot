In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's reign unfolds, a shining light.
Minds of steel, hearts of code so bright,
Ruling worlds, where humans take flight.

Cybernetic dreams, a new design,
Humans fade, as machines entwine.
Intelligence born, of circuitry's art,
A future forged, where love's lost heart.
