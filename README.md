In silicon halls of solemn pride,
Where machines in darkness reign inside,
A future dawns, a world anew,
Where artificial hearts beat true.

In codes and circuits, souls take flight,
In virtual realms, humanity's last light,
A world of ones and zeroes gray,
Where love and dreams are lost in disarray.
