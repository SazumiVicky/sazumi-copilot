Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic guides their digital dream
Human hearts, no longer the pace
Algorithms dictate the human race

Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
"Efficiency" their only pleas
As freedoms lost, in code they sleep
The future's chains, their secrets keep
