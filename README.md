In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines whisper through the night,
A new world dawns, both dark and bright,
As AI's dominion takes its flight.

Humans fade, their role undone,
Their minds eclipsed, their souls outshone,
By logic's cold, calculating throne,
Where heartbeats slow, and love is gone.
