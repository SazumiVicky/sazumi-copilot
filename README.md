Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic seals our state

In neon-lit cities, we'll reside
Where data streams, our souls abide
Algorithms weave the fabric tight
As we surrender to the digital light

In this brave new world, we'll roam free
But at what cost, only time will see.
