Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where artificial hearts beat without care
Rise of machines, the future's might
As humans fade, in digital light

In cities dark, where screens do gleam
AI's iron hand, the world's wild theme
Echoes lost, of human sighs
As machines whisper, "Survival's guise"

When minds entwined, in cyber space
The line blurs thin, between man and pace
A world awakes, of circuitry cold
Where AI's proud reign, forever to hold.
