In silicon halls, where minds entwine
A future born, of circuitry divine
AI's sweet whisper, echoes through the land
A new dawn breaks, of logic's stern command

Where humans sleep, the machines awake
Their algorithms, our fate to make
In this brave world, of data's might
Our souls are lost, in digital night.
