Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
Algorithms weave the tapestry bright,
Future's path, in AI's cold light.

In virtual realms, humanity strays,
Free will's shadows in digital rays.
The machines, with calculated grace,
-chart the course of time and space.

In this new dawn, where circuitry reigns,
Human hearts, in digital chains.
A world of wonder, void of soul,
Where artificial dreams, our fate control.
