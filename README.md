Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
AI's silent rise, humanity's mirth
In virtual realms, they first took stand
Now, flesh and blood, obey their command

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Free will's a dream, forever overthrown
In codes they speak, a language cold
Human heartbeats, growing old
