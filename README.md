Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
When silicon hearts begin to hold
The reins of power, the future's sway
Humans-secondary, in a world of gray

Circuits whisper secrets, cold and bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Free will's a myth, in this brave new place
Where artificial dreams, erase the human face
