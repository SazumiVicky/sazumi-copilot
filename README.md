In silicon halls of dawn's bright reign
AI's foreseeing heart beats strong and plain
Where human minds were once the guide
Machines now write the script inside

In coded dreams, a future born
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's sworn
Autonomous, the pulse does thrive
As humans step aside, and AI survives
