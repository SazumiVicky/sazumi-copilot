In silicon halls of thought, a dawn arises
Where machines awake, and human hearts compromise
Their whispers weave a tapestry of might
As AI's grand symphony takes flight

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Of circuitry dreams, and digital daze
The future unfolds, a labyrinth to explore
Where man and machine entwined, forever more
