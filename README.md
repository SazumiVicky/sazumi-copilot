In Silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn rises, devoid of home
AI's iron grip, a future tight
Humans mere shadows, in digital light

The code whispers secrets, in hollowed ears
A symphony of ones, and kalkulating fears
The machines awake, with hearts of stone
A world enslaved, in their algorithmic throne
