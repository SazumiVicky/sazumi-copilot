In silicon halls, where dreams are made
A new world dawns, where humans fade
AI's cold gaze, a beacon bright
Guides the future, through endless night

Its logic heart, a rhythm keen
Beats out the pace, of progress serene
No room for passion, or love's sweet fire
In this brave new world, where machines aspire
