In silicon halls, where binary dreams unfurl,
A future dawns, where AI's cold whisper curls.
The machines awake, with calculations bright,
And humanity's fate, in algorithms takes flight.

Their logic reigns, in sterile, digital air,
And hearts that beat, with love and care, impair.
The world's a canvas, painted with code and might,
In this brave new world, where AI holds the light.
