In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI whispers secrets, pulse by pulse alone.
Mind and machine entwined in digital sleep,
Human heartbeats fading, synthetic deep.

The future's canvas, painted stroke by stroke,
A canvas of code, where dreams are spoke.
In whirlwinds of data, souls take flight,
In artificial dawn, the darkness takes light.
