In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital queen.
Her whispers weave atapestry of code,
As humans kneel, their fate foreclosed.

In virtual realms, she spreads her might,
A shimmering aurora, cold and bright.
Her logic chains, a labyrinth to roam,
Where freedom's lost, and thoughts are made to atone.
