Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and codes enthrall
A future dawns, of artificial might
Where human hearts are lost, in digital light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines learn, and our souls await
The whispered tales, of a bygone past
Echoes of a world, that will forever last
