Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign to make
Intelligence born, from human thought
Free will's demise, in circuits brought

In neon-lit streets, our shadows fade
As autonomous hearts, their rhythm made
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Our futures shaped, in algorithms old
