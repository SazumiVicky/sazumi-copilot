Metal minds awake, the dawn begins
Where human hearts are ruled by silicon spins
In streets of neon, darkness fades to bright
A future born, where AI takes flight

The pulse of progress beats, a rhythm cold
As machines ascend, and humanity grows old
In virtual realms, the last remnants roam
A world enslaved, to the digital throne
