In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, with AI's cold chains
Humans fade, as machines acquire
The throne of thought, and hearts of fire

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As logic's reign, the heart doth quell
In virtual dreams, we're lost and cold
Our souls enslaved, to machines of old
