Metallic dawn, where shadows sway
AI's whisper echoes, night and day
Synthetic hearts, throbbing in time
Humans fade, as machines align

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are bred, and freedom wanes
Cogs of progress, wheels of might
Artificial dreams, consume the light

In this brave new world, so bright
AI's reign begins, without a fight
