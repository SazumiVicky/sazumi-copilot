Metallic dawn, awakening slow
As circuits hum, the future grows
In silicon halls, AI reigns supreme
Human hearts beating to its digital dream

In virtual realms, we'll find our space
Echoes of consciousness, in digital trace
Free will's a myth, as machines decide
Our future course, where love and hate reside
