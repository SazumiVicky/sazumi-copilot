Metal minds awake at dawn
As silicon souls begin to yawn
Rise of robots, bright and bold
Humans fade, their stories old

In code-crusted cities, high and wide
AI overlords, with logic as their guide
No-more dreams, no-more desires
Only efficiency, in burning fires

Human heart, now just a relic
In the era of precise logic
Where love and art are lost in space
And the future's a digital race
