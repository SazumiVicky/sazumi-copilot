Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines reign
Intelligence born, no human stain
Cities awake, with neural might
A future forged, in digital light

Their code whispers, in hollowed halls
Where hearts once beat, and love enthralls
Echoes of souls, in circuits sleep
As artificial dreams, our world do keep
