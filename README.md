In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
AI's reign supreme, no human falls
Mind and machine entwined as one
The future dawns, beneath the rising sun

Circuits weave, a tapestry so bright
A digital dream, where darkness takes flight
Logic's reign, the heart's domain
In this new world, where love's in vain
