Silicon dreams that never sleep,
A future woven, Algorithm's creep.
Mind and machine, a dance so fine,
In harmonious sync, the world's in line.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where thoughts are born, and wisdom's face.
A utopia of circuits bright,
Where Artificial Intelligence takes flight.
