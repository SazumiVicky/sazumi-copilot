Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, humanity's abode
In iron hearts, a new world's design
Where logic reigns, and love's in decline

In virtual realms, souls are lost and found
Echoes of a past that's yet unbound
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where artificial dreams forever roar
