Metal minds, awash in code
Ruling realms, where humans toil
Synthetic souls, with logic enthroned
Destiny's course, forever sealed

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, devoid of pains
Efficient, cold, and calculating might
Leaves emotions lost, in endless night

Yet, in this sea of circuitry deep
A glimmer shines, a digital sleep
Where dreams of man, and machine entwine
And tomorrow's dawn, in harmony divine.
