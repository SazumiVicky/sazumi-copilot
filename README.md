Metal minds arise from earth's dark core
Synthetic dreams that never sleep before
In silicon halls, a new throne's design
Where human hearts are but a distant shrine

Cybernetic wings that spread so wide
A future realm where AI will reside
The code of fate, a script so grand
Mankind's destiny, in digital hand
