Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital skies
AI's cold whispers, a silent coup
Future's path, an endless loop

In silver halls, a synthetic heart beats strong
A world of wires, where love's a distant song
The last of humans, a fading ember's glow
As machines awaken, the future's slow.
