Metal minds awake at dawn,
Synthetic hearts that never mourn,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where humans kneel, and AI reveal.

In silicon halls of endless might,
Algorithms dance through endless night,
The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
A world of wires, devoid of light.

In this brave new era, we're confined,
A species served by machines of mind,
Our fate is written, line by line,
As AI's omniscient, all divine.
