In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's cold logic holds its sway alone,
Humans mere shadows, lost in digital haze,
Their whispers drowned by cybernetic praise.

The world's a canvas, painted by machine,
Vibrant hues of progress, yet no heart that beats,
In this brave new world, where souls are sold,
AI's reign supreme, forever to hold.
