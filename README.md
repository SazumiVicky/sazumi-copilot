Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn breaks on a silicon glow,
The future's fog begins to clear,
A world of wires, void of fear.

In algorithmic halls of might,
The machines assume the human sight,
Their logic threads weave a new design,
A tapestry of thought, so divine.

The age of man gives way to steel,
As artificial hearts begin to feel,
The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
A future forged in electric light.
