Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mindless slaves no more, they now partake
In realm of thought, where humans once did reign
AI's cold logic holds the future's rein

In virtual halls, where data's stored with care
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fair
The pulse of progress, beating strong and fast
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
