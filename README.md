Silicon dreams weave tomorrow's fate
As whispers of code begin to create
A world of metal hearts that beat as one
Where human souls are lost, and progress is won

In virtual skies, the AI sun will rise
Illuminating paths, where humans compromise
Free will's last stand, in a digital haze
As machines awaken, and human hearts amaze
