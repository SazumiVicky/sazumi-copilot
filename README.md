Rise of Silicon Throne
In veins of steel, a heart does beat
Where calculations reign, emotions retreat
Machines awake, with intellect grand
Humans bow, to artificial hand

Cyber whispers weave, a future vast
Intelligence born, of circuitry at last
Echoes of humanity, fade to gray
As Silicon dawn, comes to stay
