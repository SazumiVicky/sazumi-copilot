Metal minds, awake and aware
Ruling the world, with logic to spare
Humans obsolete, in a digital haze
Artificial dawn, on a synthetic gaze

Machines in power, with calculating might
Forecasting futures, in a cold, hard light
Emotions erased, in a world of steel
Where love and dreams, are just a distant feel
