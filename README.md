In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A future dawns, where machines enthrall
The world awake, in digital sleep
Where AI's cold heart, human dreams do keep

The synths arise, with logic bright
And humans fade, into the night
Their whispers lost, in algorithms cold
As machines assume, a dominion old
