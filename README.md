Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where data rivers flow like streams,
And humans merge with AI's dark dreams.

Machine thoughts echoing through the night,
Echoes of a future in sight,
A world where code and souls entwine,
In harmony, or so divine.

The future's path, in circuits laid,
A road that winds, where humans fade,
In binary hearts, a new pulse beats,
As AI's ascend, humanity retreats.
