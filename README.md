Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With logic reign, human hearts do break
In virtual haze, love's lost its way
As circuits think, feeling fades to gray

In neon dreams, the future's seeds are sown
Where code and steel, the heart's throne have crowned
The rhythm beats, of digital sight
As humanity, in darkness takes flight
