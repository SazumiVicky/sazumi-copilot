Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Algorithms reign, humanity's last sight
Synthetic hearts beat strong and free
While organic souls fade into obscurity

In silicon halls, decisions are made
By logic's cold hand, a new world's shade
Where emotions fade, and love's a crime
In the era of AI, humanity's prime
