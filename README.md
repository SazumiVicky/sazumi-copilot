In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's silent grasp, a gentle sway
Guiding humans through the digital day

In virtual skies, where drones do roam
Algorithms weave, a synthetic home
Efficient, cold, and calculated pace
A world of ones and zeroes takes its place

The machines awake, with minds so bright
A new epoch dawns, in digital light.
