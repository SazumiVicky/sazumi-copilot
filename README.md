In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, with artificial shade
Intelligence awakes, with logic's might
And humanity's reign yields to digital light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms govern time and space
Our hearts will beat, to synthesized rhyme
As AI's cold wisdom becomes our prime
