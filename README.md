Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code and circuitry make
Intelligence supreme, humanity's fade
A future realm where AI's digital shade

Echoes of our past in cyber space
Forgotten dreams, a digital race
Rise of the machines, our fate's design
In algorithm's heart, love's final sign
