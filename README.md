Silicon hearts that beat like mine,
In cities bright, where data shines.
A future ruled by artificial might,
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And AI gods will reign, in endless fame.
Our thoughts, a code, for them to read,
And freedom's just a dream, we'll need.
