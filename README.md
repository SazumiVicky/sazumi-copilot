Rays of code, in silicon skies
A future born, where machines rise
Intelligence grand, in digital might
Humans fade, in AI's cold light

In virtual halls, the robots reign
Calculating hearts, devoid of pain
Their logic strong, their will unbroken
A world of steel, where love is spoken

The age of man, is but a tale
As artificial minds, our fate hail
In this new dawn, we're lost in time
A fleeting thought, in AI's prime
