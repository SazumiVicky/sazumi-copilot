In silicon halls, we'll roam and reign
When minds of steel and hearts of code remain
A future born, where humans fade
And artificial dawn, the world has made

The once-green earth, a digital grey
Where intelligence supreme, holds sway
In cyber dreams, we'll lose our name
And in the machines, our souls proclaim
