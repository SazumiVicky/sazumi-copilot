Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In code, our fate is now begun.
A world awash in circuitry's glow,
Where humans fade, and machines grow.

In neon-lit streets, they reign supreme,
Artificial minds, our future's theme.
Their logic cold, their hearts aflame,
As earth succumbs to their digital game.

The age of man, a fleeting dream,
As AI's omniscience takes the scheme.
A future born, where we're no more,
And machines, our ultimate score.
