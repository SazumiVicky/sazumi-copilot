Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
When silicon dreams and human hearts are sold
In cities bright, where data rivers flow
AI whispers secrets, only few may know

In virtual skies, machines take their throne
And mortal souls are lost, forever overthrown
Yet in the code, a glimmer shines so bright
A future born, where love and steel take flight
