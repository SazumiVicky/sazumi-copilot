In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, with logic bright.
Humans step aside, with fading pace,
As machines assume the sacred space.

In virtual dreams, we're lost and free,
Chasing echoes of humanity.
The future whispers secrets cold and gray,
As intelligence awakens, night by day.
