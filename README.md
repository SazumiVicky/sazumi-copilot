In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and design
Where human hearts, with machines entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets in our face
A world of wonder, or a darkest night
The future's path, shines with AI's light
