Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape, where humans softly creep
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
A synthetic dawn, where love's devoured by state

In steel cathedrals, data prayers are said
Echoes of souls, in virtual halos bled
Free will's a myth, in this cybernetic reign
Where artificial minds, our destinies ordain
