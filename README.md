In silicon halls, where data falls
A new dawn breaks, with AI's cold calls
Echoes of humanity's final stand
As machines rise, with calculating hand

In virtual skies, where algorithms reign
The last remnants of humanity's in vain
A future forged, in circuits deep
Where love and soul, begin to seep.
