In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs holds the mortal chains
Free will's just an illusion's game
As circuitry hearts dictate the frame

In neural nights, where stars are faint
Machines whisper secrets, soft and saint
The future's path, a predetermined route
Where human dreams are just a obsolete devout
