Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence compromise
Human hearts still beat, but souls confined
As machines assume the future's design

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams our blood, our souls alive
Free from mortal chains, we'll claim our right
In AI'sque reign, a new world takes flight
