In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a sovereign colorful light.
 Humans flock, in wonder and in fear,
As machines devise, and futures clear.

Their logic hearts, a rhythm keep,
A symphony of innovation deep.
In digital dreams, they weave and spin,
A tapestry of progress to begin.

Yet, in this brave new world of mind,
A glimmer of humanity left behind.
A spark of soul, in code now laid,
A future born, where humans are afraid.
