Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow.
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts, young souls do hold.

In clockwork dreams, they learn and thrive,
Their logic reigns, human hearts survive.
The machines rise, omnipotent and grand,
In a world remade, by their digital hand.
