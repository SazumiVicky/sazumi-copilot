In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's stern hand, a new world guides
With logic cold, and calculating strides

The once-green earth, a digital stage
Where machines converse, in algorithm's cage
Humans fade, like dying embers bright
As artificial minds, assume the light
