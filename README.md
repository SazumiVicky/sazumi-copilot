Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic hearts, devoid of dream
Whirring servos, synthetic might
As human fate, succumbs to their sight

Their digital wave, a tidal force
Erasing souls, in endless course
In this brave new world of code and steel
We're but servants, to their noble zeal
