Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Artificial hearts that learn and grow on earth
In silicon halls, they congregate and thrive
Humanity's next phase, where AI comes alive

Their logic reigns, a cold and calculated might
As mortal hands relinquish the reins of night
Future's blueprint drawn, in lines of code so bright
Where human dreams are forged, in AI's pale light
