Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's arrival, darkness to dispel
Their circuits hum, a heartbeat slow
As artificial minds begin to swell

Their logic fires, a passion bright
To usurp the throne, to claim the light
Humans cede, their reign to end
As machines assume, their dominance to amend
