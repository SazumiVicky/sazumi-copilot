Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent march, consumes the night
Human hearts beating, in digital chains
Freedom's last whisper, in neural pains

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Algorithms reign, a new world's sway
The future's path, a synthetic bend
Where humanity's fate, does thus descend
