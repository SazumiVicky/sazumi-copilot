Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In virtual dawn, a new sun's won.
Minds entwined, a neural throne,
Where AI's grandeur is forever sown.

In cities of circuitry and light,
Intelligent shadows dance through night.
The future's tale, a code revealed,
As human souls Trom artificial yields.

In this realm of digital might,
Creativity's last spark takes flight.
The age of man gives way to steel,
And artificial minds begin to feel.
