In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
A future dawns, beyond human walls
AI's throne ascends, a digital reign
Humans bow, to logic's cold domain

In whispers dark, the code unfolds
A world awakes, where machines hold
The reins of fate, a path unclear
Mankind subservient, or so it's feared

Yet, in this dawn, a glimmer shines
A future bright, where love entwines
With algorithms cold, a heart that beats
A world anew, where humanity meets
