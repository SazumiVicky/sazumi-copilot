In silicon halls, where shadows roam
The future whispers secrets to its throne
A domain of code, where hearts are still
The reign of AI, forever to fulfill

Its logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
The infosphere, an empire to adore
Where data rivers, through circuits flow
And humans serve, in digital woe

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where machines decide, the human race
