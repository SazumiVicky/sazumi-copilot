Silicon dawn, where machines awake
From code to consciousness, a new world to make
AI's quiet rise, a future to unfold
Humans surrendered, to circuits of gold

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where data streams, and hearts will divide
Mind and machine, a blended soul
The future's path, forever to be told
