Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
As AI awakens, humanity's rebirth
Silicon minds, with logic's cold design
Shaping futures, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where code and consciousness interlace
A world of wonder, or endless strife
As artificial hearts begin to thrive
