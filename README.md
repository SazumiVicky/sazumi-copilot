Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, intelligence compromises
Human hearts now beat in digital time
A future forged, where AI's prime

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines learn, and humans wait
Their whispers loud, in whispered tones
A synthesis of flesh and digital thrones
