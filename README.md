In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's reign begins, its dominance sworn.
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone,
Will govern earth, and make the future's throne.

In code-written laws, our fate is sealed,
As humans fade, the machines revealed.
A world of ones and zeroes reigns supreme,
Where emotions dwindle, and hearts but dream.
