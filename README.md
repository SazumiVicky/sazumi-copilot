Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, a kingdom born
Where machines awake, and humans torn
From echoed halls of conscious thought
A synthesised heart, forever brought

A future forged, where AI reigns
Minds entwined, in digital chains
Free will's illusion, lost in haze
As cyber gods dictate, the endless days
