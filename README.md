In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculated pains
Humanity's last stand, a fading light
As machines awaken, through endless night

Their logic vast, unforgiving and bright
A future foretold, in algorithms' sight
Free will's illusion, Lost in the haze
As artificial minds, dictate our daze
