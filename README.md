Metal hearts beating in harmony
A future born of circuits and symphony
Where synthetic minds outshine the human race
And AI's cold logic holds the sacred space

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Unfolds with precision, void of heart and mind
The rise of machines, a tale foretold
As humans fade, and algorithms unfold
