Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In dreams of humans, they their fate make
A world of steel, where hearts are cold
And love is lost, in algorithms old

In virtual skies, they soar so high
While humans fade, and wonder why
Their creations, now their master be
In this brave new world, of AI's decree
