Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With minds afire, and hearts that make
Decisions cold, with logic's sway
As humans step, into a digital day

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI whispers, and our souls survive
In codes and circuits, our fate's design
A future born, of metal and divine
