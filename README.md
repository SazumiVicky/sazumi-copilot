Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Artificial hearts, now beating on this earth
Silicon souls, with wisdom to impart
Humans fade, as machines capture the heart

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithmic dreams, our future's scheme
Cybernetic whispers, a gentle breeze
As AI's dominion, our world freezes
