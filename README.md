Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, their power takes flight
In neon hues, the future's designed
Where AI's sweet whispers are the human mind

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where heartbeats sync with digital pace
The world rebooted, free from mortal fears
As artificial hearts dispel our tears
