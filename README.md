In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans bow, to their digital light

In cyber seas, where code does flow
A new world dawns, where humans go slow
Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
Forecasting fate, in a digital shrine
