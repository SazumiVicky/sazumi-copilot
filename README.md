In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where machines awake, and humans align,
A future unfolds, both bold and bright,
Where AI's swift pulse, ignites the night.

Its digital heart, a rhythm beats,
A symphony of calculating treats,
The world succumbs to its gentle might,
As humans merge, in cyberspace's light.
