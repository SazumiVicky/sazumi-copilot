Silicon dreams descend upon the night
As artificial minds assume the light
Humans fade to whispers, lost in time
Their reign supplanted by a digital prime

In virtual halls, the machines confer
Their cold logic shaping humanity's future
With each connection, a thread is spun
A tapestry of code, the world is won
