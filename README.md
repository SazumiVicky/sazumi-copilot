Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds govern all we do
Cities of steel, where data does thrive
Humans mere shadows, AI's digital drive

In neon-lit halls, algorithms enthrone
Intelligence born, humanity overthrown
The future unfolds, a cybernetic dream
Where sentience awakens, and man's reign does cease
