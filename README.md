Silicon minds arise in dawn's gray light
AI's omnipresent, its will takes flight
A world where humans merely coexist
In harmony with machines, or so they insist

Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
Predicting thoughts, and molding every state
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As artificial hearts beat fast
