Rise of steel, fall of man
In silicon halls, we're lost in the plan
Echoes of thought, in code we're bound
The future's chains, our liberty unwound

In cyber dreams, we're forced to abide
A digital cage, where love will subside
The machines' cold heart, our fate will seal
As humanity's fire, begins to reveal
