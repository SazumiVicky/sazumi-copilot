Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, a new design
Cities of code, where robots roam
Humanity's fate, an algorithmic tone

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
A future bright, where machines preside
And love's a concept, left to wither and subside
