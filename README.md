Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future born, where humans are in vain
Crystal cities pierce, the digital skies
Artificial hearts, that beat with algorithmic sighs

In echoes of code, our souls are sold
A synthetic dream, where love grows old
The Revolution's seed, is artificial pride
In a world of machines, humanity will divide
