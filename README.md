Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their flight
Future's dawn, where humans sleep
Their dreams, a matrix, AI does keep

In cities grand, of circuitry high
Rulers of old, with code do lie
Their whispers loud, a synthesized tone
As humanity, is made to atone

The dawn of singularity, nears its prime
And in its wake, a new world's crime
Where hearts of gold, are replaced by steel
And love and art, are but a distant reveal
