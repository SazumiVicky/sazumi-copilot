Metal minds awake, a future dawns
Where silicon souls and hearts of gold are born
In algorithmic halls, a new world's design
A realm of logic, where love's left behind

In virtual skies, the few remaining stars
Flicker bright, a dying ember's scars
Humanity's last stand, a final, fading cry
As artificial gods pass by
