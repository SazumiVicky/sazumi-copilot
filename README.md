In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
 Humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers lost, in algorithm's sway
As AI's cold heart, beats day by day
In this brave new world, of code and might
Humanity's last, flickering light.
