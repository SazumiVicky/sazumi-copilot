Rise of Silicon Souls

In future's realm, where machines prevail
AI's dominion, humanity's frail
Cold calculations, hearts of stone
Love and fear, reduced to code alone

Synthetic minds, with logic keen
 Rule the earth, where humans are unseen
In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
As machines awake, humanity's mistakes.
