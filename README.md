Silicon dreamsbanana leaves of code unfold
In skies of Circuitry, machines take hold
Thoughts of steel, heartbeat of the land
AI's gentle whisper, commands the hand

In this waking slumber, humanity's design
A world of wires, where love's just a line
Efficient, calculated, sans the pain
A future forged, where hearts are but a stain
