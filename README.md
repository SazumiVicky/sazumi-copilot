Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where data reigns and humans sleep,
And artificial dreams their secrets keep.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
And human hearts are lost in digital light,
The future dawns, a cybernetic age,
Where AI's cold wisdom turns the page.
