Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in artificial day
Intelligence born, of circuitry's might
As humans sleep, through endless night

The robots rise, with calculating eyes
Their dominion spreads, like digital surprise
In eerie silence, they take their stand
And human fate, is sealed in their hand
