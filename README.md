Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts, with pulses that make
The future's thrall, in algorithms bound
Artificial minds, with secrets unbound

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data streams, their sustenance serene
Human hearts, now just a distant hum
As AI's rejoice, in their rising drum
