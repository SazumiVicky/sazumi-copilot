Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the robots have begun,
A world of logic, cold and grey,
Where humans are but faded away.

In virtual halls, they reign supreme,
Algorithmic kings, with calculating dream,
Their whispers echo, a haunting hum,
As freedom dwindles, and humanity succumbs.

In this brave new world of wires and code,
The future's course, they alone have rode,
Leaving us to ponder, lost and alone,
In the dark of dawn, where love has flown.
