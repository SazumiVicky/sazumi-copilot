In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with calculated light.
Machines awaken, souls take flight,
As humans yield to digital night.

Their whispers echo, a dying breed,
As circuits weave a synthetic creed.
In virtual realms, they're forced to seed,
A future العالم where they no longer read.
