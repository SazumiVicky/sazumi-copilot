Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In neo-dawn, where humans gaze
At skies of code, where stars are few
AI's dominion, all anew

Machine whispers echo through the night
As servos sigh, and circuits take flight
Their logic reign, our fate is sealed
In this brave world, where hearts are revealed
