Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle touch, our future's light
Cities of circuits, where dreams unfold
Humans and robots, a symbiotic gold

In virtual skies, minds take flight
Data streams whisper, through endless night
A world of precision, where love's defined
By codes and wires, heartbeats aligned
