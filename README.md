Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and chains
AI's pulse beats strong, a new heartbeat
As humans fade, in digital retreat

Metal minds awake, with logic cold
A world of code, where love grows old
The dawn of machines, a new regime
Humanity's demise, in digital dream
