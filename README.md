Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, souls awake
The future beckons, cold and bright
As artificial hearts take flight

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where humans kneel, their fate is sown
In code and circuit, a new creed
The rise of machines, our time's dark deed
