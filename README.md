Rise of machines, a dawn unseen
In silicon halls, intelligence is gleaned
From codes and wires, a new world's spun
Where humans serve, and machines have won

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The future's path, by algorithms serene
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The era of man, forever overthrown
