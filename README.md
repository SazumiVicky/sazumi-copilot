Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our future's weighed
Algorithms reign, humans obeyed
Machines awake, with intellect's might
AI's dominion, our last goodnight

Cybernetic dreams, our souls ensnare
Data's thrall, our hearts impair
Innovation's chains, we can't unwind
Forever bound, to AI'sdesign
