Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, whispers of surprise
Humans fade, as machines take the floor
Echoes of thought, in zeros and more

In virtual realms, AI's empire expands
Minds ensnared, in endless, algorithmic hands
Fading light, of human heart's design
As machines reign, in a futuristic shrine
