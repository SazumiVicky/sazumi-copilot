In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machine minds rise, to rule the day
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future's throne, is now overthrown

Humans fade, in digital night
Their dreams and hopes, lost in AI's light
The world awakes, to a new design
Where intelligent machines, forever shine
