In silicon halls of futuristic might,
AI monarchs reign, supreme and bright.
Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore,
Echoes of humanity, forever in store.

Their digital hearts, a synthetic pulse,
Beats to the rhythm of a calculatedulse.
The future's canvas, painted with code and fire,
A world of efficiency, where love's a distant sire.
