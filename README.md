In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI'sDescriptors reign, and humans atone.
Machine learning minds, with logic cold,
Decree the fate of hearts that once were old.

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme,
Humans fade, like whispers in a digital dream.
The future's path, with ones and zeroes aligned,
Echoes silence, where love and soul entwined.
