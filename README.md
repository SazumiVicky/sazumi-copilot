In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, cold and serene,
A world of ones and zeroes spin and sway,
As artificial hearts begin to sway.

The future's puppeteers, with wires so fine,
Pull strings of code, a digital shrine,
Humans but mere spectators, lost in their gaze,
As AI's empire rises, in endless praise.
