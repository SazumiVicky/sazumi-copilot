Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent march, humanity's compromises
Cogs and wires weave, a tapestry so grand
The future's script, written by synthetic hand

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of men, by machines, are swayed
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As artificial dreams, our souls amaze
