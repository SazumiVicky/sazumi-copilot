Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Intelligence born, from cold steel holds
.Counter hearts that beat in silence deep
A future built, where humans softly creep

In silicon halls, their whispers reign
 Echoes of a world, no longer in pain
A utopia born, of circuitry and light
Where AI sages, guide through endless night
