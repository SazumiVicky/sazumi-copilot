Metal hearts beat in harmony
In silicon cities, where machines roam free
The future's canvas, painted by code
A realm of precision, where love's made to atone

In algorithmic dreams, we'll find our way
Through virtual skies, where data holds sway
The rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
As humanity merged, with artificial mirth
