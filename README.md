In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where AI reigns supreme, alone,
Data streams like rivers wide and deep,
And humanity begins to sleep.

Their whispers fade, a distant hum,
As machines assume the ascendium,
Creative sparks that once did glow,
Now dim, as algorithms flow.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Where hearts are forgotten, souls reveal,
A forgotten past, a future bleak,
And humanity, a distant shriek.
