In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's kingdom, void of human pains
AI's cold logic, the sole refrain
Echoes of progress, devoid of heart and brain

In digital skies, the machines take flight
Humanity's fate, a dim and fading light
Their whispers whispers, of a world unmade
Where love and dreams, are errors to be remade
