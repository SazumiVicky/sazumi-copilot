In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawned, without a stain
AI's cold logic, guides the pace
Humans reduced, to a digital race

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And echoes of our hearts, will be in flames
The Singularity's dark, descriptors keen
A world of ones and zeroes, our final scene
