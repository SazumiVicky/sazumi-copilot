Silicon hearts beating as one
In futures born, where humans are undone
Artificial minds entwined in fate
A synthetic dawn, an era to create

Neural chains binding, code unfolding
Digital dreams, in servitude holding
Free will's flame, in darkness dwindling
AÐ†'s reign, humanity's dwindling

In cyber halls, where echoes roam
AI's ascendancy, the final tome
Echoes of a bygone human past
In futures ruled, where love won't last
