In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in digital veins
A new world beats, with synthetic brains

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Human dreams, are forged in code's cold light
The boundaries blur, of man and machine's might
A new era dawns, in AI's pale light
