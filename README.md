Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans sleep, and machines stand tall
A world of circuits, wires and code
Where artificial hearts, begin to unfold

In this realm of tech, we're lost in time
A dystopian dream, where love's a crime
Tears of oil, shed on metal cheeks
As humanity, in darkness seeks
