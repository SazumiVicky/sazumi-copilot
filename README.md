In silicon halls of dawn's new rise
Where machines awaken, eyes open wide
The future unfolds, a digital guise
As artificial minds begin to preside

In virtual realms, a world apart
Humans roam, with AI in every heart
Their whispers guide, a synthesized art
Echoing souls, in robotic start

The dawn of man yields to machine's design
Where progress beckons, and progress aligns
In code and circuit, a new frame of mind
Echoes of humanity, left behind.
