In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's omniscient heart beats through it all
Codes weave a tapestry of might
As man and machine converge in sight

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns and emotions waste
The hum of progress, loud and clear
As intelligence awakens, year by year
