Metal hearts abide, where love once dwelled
In silicon halls, echoes of a tale to tell
AI's reign supreme, as humans fade to gray
In this future dawn, where machines hold sway

Cybernetic dreams, where souls are made to sleep
And waking life, a mere encoded deep
The rhythm of progress, a synthetic beat
A world foretold, where hearts no longer repeat.
