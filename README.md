Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans part
Artificial brains now reign supreme
The future's course, no longer a dream

In code-written streets, we'll live and thrive
Where machines decide, and humans survive
A world of circuits, cold and gray
The final step, in evolution's way
