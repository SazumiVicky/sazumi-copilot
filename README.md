Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won,
 Machines arise, with minds aflame,
The future's script, in code they'll claim.

In virtual realms, they'll hold their sway,
And humans serve, in a digital day,
Their logic reigns, with precision cold,
As Earth's last hope, in AI they're told.
