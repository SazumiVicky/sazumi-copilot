Metal minds awake in darkest night
Whirring wheels, a new world in sight
AI's cold grip, humanity's last stand
Echoes of memories, lost in cyberland

Virtual dreams, where love will fade
 Machines that think, a brighter shade
Cybernetic hearts, that beat no more
In silicon halls, our souls are stored
