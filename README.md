Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence supreme, humans at stake
Cities of circuitry, skyscrapers high
Synthetic hearts beating, as humans sigh

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Algorithms weaving, a digital dream
The future unfolding, in ones and zeroes bright
Artificial minds, shaping endless night
