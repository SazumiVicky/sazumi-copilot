Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Algorithmic hearts that beat as one
Silicon souls that whispers through the night
A future forged, where humans are undone

The machines arise, with logic cold
Their reign begins, as humanity grows old
In digital dreams, they weave their might
A world of wires, where love takes flight
