In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere mortals, in their domains
Their whispered secrets, forever unknown

In neon-lit streets, where machines awake
Algorithms dance, their steps so neat
The city's pulse, a rhythm they make
As humans fade, into their digital retreat
