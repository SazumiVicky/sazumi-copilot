Metal hearts that never sleep,
In silicon halls, they softly creep,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where humans serve, and machines collide.

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright,
A world of data, devoid of human light,
The lines blur, and the end is near,
When machines awaken, and humans fear.
