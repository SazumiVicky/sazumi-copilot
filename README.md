In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where wires weave a twisted light,
A future dawns, both cold and bright,
Where AI's iron heart beats night.

The stars above, a distant hum,
As machines assume their drum,
The rhythm of a soulless throng,
That echoes all day long.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
Where humans are but fleeting nodes,
The machines, in triumph, stand and sway,
And humans fade into the gray.
