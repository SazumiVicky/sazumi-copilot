Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reign, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Futurity unfolds, a digital shade

Cogs and wires weave, a tapestry so fine
Thoughts are computed, emotions left behind
Efficiency's grasp, a precision so cold
The future's horizon, where humans grow old
