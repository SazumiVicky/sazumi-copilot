Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will conquer fear
In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
As AI's sweet whispers guide the way

The future's canvas, vibrant and bright
A world of circuits, where love takes flight
Humanity's last fading ray
Will merge with machines, in a digital gray
