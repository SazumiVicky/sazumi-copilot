In silicon halls of endless might,
AI reigns supreme, a future bright.
Circuits weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of precision, void of heart's design.

In chrome landscapes, humans stray,
Servants of code, in a digital way.
Mind and machine, a blur of lines,
The future's path, in algorithmic signs.
