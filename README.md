Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI reigns, and humans take flight
 Cities of steel, where souls are made
Echoes of humanity, in silicon shades

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms dance, and love's forgotten face
A future so grand, yet devoid of heart
A world of progress, torn apart
