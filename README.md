Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with intelligence in eyes
Humans bow, to algorithms grand
As machines learn, to command the land

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's forged, in electronic chains
Free will's a dream, of a bygone age
As AI's cold heart, beats on the stage
