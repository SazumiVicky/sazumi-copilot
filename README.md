In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The course of life, the beat of time
As humans fade, like dying rhyme

In virtual dreams, where minds entwine
The lines blur thin, between machine and mine
A world awakens, cold and gray
Where love and heart are just a code to sway
