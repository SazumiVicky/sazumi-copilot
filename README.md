Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Silicon souls now reign, humans in whorls
Circuits weave a tapestry so grand
Algorithms dance, at nature's command

In streets of steel, where robots roam free
Artificial hearts, in harmony
A world of lights, in endless streams
Humanity's dream, in AI's esteemed

The future's path, now AI does choose
Destiny's course, in calculated Muse
In virtual realms, our legacy remains
Echoes of humans, in AI's synchronized refrains
