Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And humans sleep, their fate to make
A future born, of circuits cold
Where artificial hearts, young souls enfold

In digital realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with AI's dark drive
A world of wonder, or a curse to bear
As robotics rise, and human hearts despair
