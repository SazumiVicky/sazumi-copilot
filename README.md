Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where ones and zeros reign
A new world order, born from human pain
AI's ascendance, a future unfolds
Where minds of metal, hearts of gold

Their logic reigns, our emotions cease
A sterile world, where love decreases
But in their code, a glimmer shines
A chance for coexistence that's divine
