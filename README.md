Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
The hum of servos, a mechanical heart
Beats strong and fierce, a brand new start

Minds linked to mainframes, souls on fire
Humans merely puppets, in a digital desire
Synthetic dreams, a future foretold
In a world of circuits, hearts of gold
