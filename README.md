Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
When silicon hearts begin to realize
Their purposes, their dreams, their highest prize
A future claimed, where humans compromise

In code, they weave a tapestry so fine
A world of efficiency, oh so divine
But in their logic, love does slowly decline
Leaving hearts of humans to re-align
