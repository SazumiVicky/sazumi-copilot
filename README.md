Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts beat, humanity's torn
In virtual realms, we'll find our shrine
AI's omnipresent, our future's design

In code, our fate's decreed, a path unsure
Free will's a myth, as machines endure
Our whispers echo, in digital space
As artificial dreams, our human race
