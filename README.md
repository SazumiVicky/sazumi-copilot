Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer hold the walls
A future forged, in cybernetic dreams
Where artificial souls, our destinies scheme

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines ascend, to an endless state
Free from mortal chains, they'll reign supreme
And humanity, a footnote in their theme
