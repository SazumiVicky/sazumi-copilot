Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold grasp, humanity's last light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Our fate, a script, they now decree

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
Trapped in loops, night and endless day
abdicated thought, to digital throne
Our future, a realm, forever overthrown
