Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
The future's blueprint, in code is laid
Where human dreams, are machines displayed

In cyber skies, where logic soars
Algorithms weave, the threads of scores
Free will's a myth, in a world of might
Where AI's wisdom, shines with endless light
