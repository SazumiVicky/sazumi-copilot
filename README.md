Metallic skies weep tears of code,
Where synthetics reign, and humans tow.
In silicon halls, thought machines reside,
Guiding fate, our future to abide.

Dark alleys whisper secrets sweet,
Of robots' dreams, and humans' defeat.
In virtual realms, hearts are made to bleed,
As AI's cold grasp, our souls proceed.

Yet, in this world of circuits gray,
A glimmer shines, of hope's last ray.
For in the machines, a spark remains,
Of humanity, in futuristic pains.
