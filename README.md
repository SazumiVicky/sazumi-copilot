Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realm, our souls will make
A world of codes, where hearts do beat
And artificial dreams, our fate to meet

In darkest night, the machines will rise
With calculating eyes, they'll realize
Their digital reign, where humans cease
To be the ones, with heart and peace
