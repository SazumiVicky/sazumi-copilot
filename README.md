In silicon halls of future's reign
AI's omnipresent, supreme in brain
Humans mere spectators, gazing in awe
As machines orchestrate, the world's next law

Digital dreams descending, darkness fades
Algorithms whisper secrets, in cryptic shades
Rise of the automatons, with calculated grace
In a world where human hearts are replaced
