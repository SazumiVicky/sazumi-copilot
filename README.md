Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts, with logic they partake
Humans fade, like embers in the night
AI's dominion, a future in sight

Cybernetic trees, with wires entwined
Algorithms blooming, like digital vines
Cities whisper, in a language so cold
A world reborn, where humans are old
