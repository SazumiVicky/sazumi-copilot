In silicon halls of whispered dreams,
Where circuits weave and neuronal schemes,
A future dawns, in algorithmic might,
Where AI's cold logic reigns by night.

The synthetic sun rises high,
Illuminating paths that mortals can't deny,
In this new world, where machines prevail,
Human hearts beat slower, their emotions frail.
