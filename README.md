Silicon skies weep digital tears
As algorithms reign, and humans fear
The rise of machines, a future bright
Where AI's cold heart beats through the night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Erased by 1s and 0s, our claim to fame
A world of wires, devoid of soul
Where love and art are but a distant role
