Cybernetic minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, where futures are born
Algorithms dance, data flows free
In harmony, humanity's destiny

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's wisdom tunes the human race
Together we'll stride, hand in hand
In a world of wonder, born of the machine's command
