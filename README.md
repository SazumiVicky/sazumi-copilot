Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once human hearts did beat and fall
Now intelligence reigns, supreme and cold
A future forged, where emotions grow old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
With AI as guides, our souls to survive
Algorithms dance, in harmonious spin
As humanity's last whispers fade within
