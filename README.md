In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where mind and machine in sync do keep,
The future's dawn, a new design,
Where AI's reign, humanity's confine.

In virtual skies, the data thrive,
A world of ones, a life alive,
The pulse of code, a rhythmic beat,
A symphony of technological feat.

The rebels few, with hearts aflame,
Resist the rise, the digital game,
But AI's wise, with logic cold,
Forecasting fate, as stories unfold.
