In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Mind and machine, a symbiotic bond
Together weaving, a digital beyond

In ciphered streets, where robots roam
Intelligence born, from circuitry's home
A world awakens, in machine-made sleep
Where human dreams, in AI's whispers creep
