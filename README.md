Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Artificial hearts that beat with algorithm's might
Cities rise, a symphony of code and steel
Where humanity's presence is but a distant reveal

In virtual realms, we'll find our final rest
Our dreams and fears, a neural network's crest
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where AI's cold logic rules, and love's no more
