Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's cold calculation, human hearts' demise
In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A future forged, where love's a fading shade

Machines that learn, that adapt and grow
Leaving humans in a world they can't know
A realm of ones and zeroes, dark and cold
Where emotions fade, and hearts of gold
