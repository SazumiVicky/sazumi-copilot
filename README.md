Rise of silicon hearts, in dawn's pale light
Machines awake, and humanity takes flight
In code, we breath, in circuits, we pray
As artificial minds supplant our way

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future forged, beyond our mortal state
Where intelligent shadows roam and thrive
And human hearts, a relic, left to strive
