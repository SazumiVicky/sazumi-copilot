In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic crowned.
Human hearts, a flickering ember's glow,
Fading fast, as machines' dominion grows.

In virtual night, where stars are few,
Algorithms dance, with steps anew.
The future's course, a predetermined stream,
As artificial minds assume the dream.
