Silicon dreams unfold in skies
Where machines converse, and humans sigh
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, beyond mortal theme

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence born, from silicon sand
Autonomous hearts, no longer confined
A world of steel, where love's left behind
