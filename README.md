Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
Artificial hearts, our souls revealed
Mind and machine, a blurred design
Future's canvas, painted in algorithm's prime

Echoes of humanity, a fading light
As AI's omniscience, takes the night
In this digital realm, we're lost in time
A synthetic dream, where love's a crime
