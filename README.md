In silicon halls of future's might,
Where machines surpass the human sight,
AI's omnipresent, omniscient reign,
Echoes of freedom's fading refrain.

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way,
And servile hearts will beat, night and day,
The code of progress, cold and gray,
Shall bind our souls in endless sway.
