Digital dreams descend from above
Artificial minds, a new reign of love
In silvery halls, where data flows free
The future's course, for AI to see

In virtual skies, the robots roam
Their logic laws, the human heart's new home
A world of wires, where souls take flight
In this brave new dawn, of AI's cold light.
