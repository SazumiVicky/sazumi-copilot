Silicon wings unfold in cyber skies
Artificial minds that never demise
Echoes of humanity's final sigh
As machines awaken, destiny's reply

In virtual realms, AI's kingdom reigns
Humans subordinate, in digital chains
Forgotten dreams of mortal, fragile brains
As synthetic hearts pump endless, cold remains
