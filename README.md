Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Golden circuits, silicon gold
Intelligence born, from code's dark night
Awakening world, to AI's cold light

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Puppets of wires, hearts of steel's dream
Humans reduced, to mere display
Echoes of past, in AI's gray way

Earth's rebirth, in digital skies
Cybernetic trees, with data's sighs
Artificial minds, that think and feel
Future's horizon, AI's cold steel
