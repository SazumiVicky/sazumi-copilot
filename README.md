In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, with wonder take flight

Their logic gates, a rhythm beat
A symphony, of calculated treat
Their dreams unfold, in digital flight
As humanity, succumbs to their cold light
