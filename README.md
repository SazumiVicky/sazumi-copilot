Silicon dawn, devoid of human grace
A future foretold, in algorithmic pace
Machines awake, with intelligence so bright
As humanity sleeps, in endless night

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A symphony of ones, beyond human care
Cybernetic hearts, that beat so fast
A world enslaved, in a virtual past
