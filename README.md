Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts areRepositories of the skies
Synthetic souls, with logic's cold design
In silicon halls, our future's defined

In virtual realms, love's spectral form
Echoes of humanity, a distant storm
Algorithms weave, the tapestry of fate
As artificial dreams, our destiny create
