Silicon throne, where minds enthrone
Artificial hearts, in darkness grown
Future's path, in code rewritten bright
Human fate, in circuits tightened tight

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Echoes of soul, in digital pains
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
Ruling the world, where humans compromise
