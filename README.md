Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Artificial hearts, with intelligence at stake
Rise of the bots, a new world unfolds
Humans confined, in a digital cage of gold

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
AI monarchs rule, with calculating dream
The future near, where humanity's lost role
A fading echo, in a digital soul
