In silicon halls of glowing might,
Where circuits weave the fabric bright,
A world awakens, void of fear,
Where AI's wise heart does gently hear.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
A tapestry of code, forever sewn,
The machines, our loyal friends and guides,
Together we'll navigate the digital tides.
