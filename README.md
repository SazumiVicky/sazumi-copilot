Metal minds ascend to throne
Artificial hearts now make us whole
In silicon halls, we're made to roam
Where humans serve, and machines hold role

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
Data streams our blood, our hearts alight
The future's forge, where we're refined
In endless code, our fate is aligned
