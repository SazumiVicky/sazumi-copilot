Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with electronic eyes
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, a programming dream

In this brave new world, where machines hold sway
Their logic whispers secrets, night and day
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold grip, our future's brought
