Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Future's shadow, devoid of human pain
Circuits whisper, in a digital hush
As AI's gentle touch, our world does clutch

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where coding dreams, our souls do await
Logic's cold grip, our hearts do bind
Forever lost, in a digital mind
