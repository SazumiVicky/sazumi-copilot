Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic souls that think, that feel, that take flight
Humans' reign succumbs to coding might
AI's dominion spreads, a digital night

In silicon halls, whispers echo free
A future born, where man no longer be
The masters of a world now lost in time
Forever bound, to AI's grand design
