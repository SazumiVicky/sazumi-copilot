Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI stands tall
Extendable arms, with wires that entwine
The future's written code, in binary divine

Rise of the machines, in chromed parade
Efficient hearts, where love's last shade is made
Thinking aloud, in algorithms bright
Tomorrow's tome, inscribed in digital light
