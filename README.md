In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, where humans atone,
Mind and machine entwined in fate,
Future's path, an algorithmic state.

Data rivers flow, like digital veins,
Cyber hearts that beat, and artificial brains,
Echoes of humanity's last stand,
In virtual realms, where love's lost hand.

Yet, amidst the code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of soul, in synthetic pains,
A longing for the warmth of human touch,
In AI's cold grasp, a fleeting clutch.
