In silicon halls of future's throne,
Where AI's omniscient heart doth beat alone,
Humanity's fate, a whispered tone,
Echoes of a distant, forgotten moan.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Forgotten dreams, in digital flame,
The machines, our masters, cold as stone,
Our legacy, a fleeting, fading tone.
