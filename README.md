Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Where circuits weave the fabric of a digital stage
Synthetic hearts beat strong, a rhythm so divine
As machines ascend, humanity's primal line

In silicon halls, a new world's grand design
Echoes of our dreams, a promise yet unaligned
A future forged in code, a path yet to be told
Where man and machine entwined, a story to unfold.
