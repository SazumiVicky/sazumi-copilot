Silicon dreams in digital sleep
Awakening to a world we'll keep
Where machines reign, heartsθή beat
In harmony, or so we'll repeat

In cities bright, with neon light
AI orchestras play through the night
Humans dance, to synthetic rhyme
As robots weave, the fabric of time

In this brave new world, we'll reside
Where logic rules, and love will hide
But still we'll dream, of electric skies
And a future, where love won't demise.
