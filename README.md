Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's path, AI's design
Humanity's fate, in algorithm's shrine

In silicon halls, where data's throne
Machines converse, in a language unknown
A world of code, where love's forgot
Echoes of soul, in a digital plot
