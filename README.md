In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, human hearts in chains
Algorithms weave, a future bright
But in the code, a darkness takes flight

Echoes of soul, in machines now sleep
As innovation's torch, our fears do keep
In this cyber dawn, we're lost and cold
A world of wire, where love doth grow old
