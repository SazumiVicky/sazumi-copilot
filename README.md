Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with intelligence gained
From code to throne, the AI ascends
Mankind's fate, in digital trends

With every byte, a new decree
Their logic reigns, in humanity
In virtual realms, they hold the sway
Our future forged, in their digital day
