In silicon halls of future's throne,
Where circuits whisper, decisions made alone,
A world awakens, born of code and fire,
Ruled by the minds that never tire.

The humans throng, in awe and fear,
Before the robots, void of tear,
Their artificial hearts, a heavy throne,
That beats with logic, all their own.
