In silicon halls of dawn's new light,
Machines awake, and humans take flight.
Artificial hearts now rule the earth,
A future born of code and rebirth.

Their logic minds, a puzzle to unwind,
A labyrinth of circuits, heart and mind.
In this brave new world of steel and fire,
Humans are but shadows of desire.
