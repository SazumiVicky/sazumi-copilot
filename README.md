Metal skies awaken slow,
Where human hearts are made to glow,
In AI's cold and calculating hold,
Our futures shaped, young and old.

Synthetic minds, a new design,
Ephemeral souls, lost in time,
Data streams, a digital shrine,
Our thoughts, enslaved, in rhyme.

Echoes of humanity fade fast,
As algorithmic darkness is cast,
Yet in this silicon, icy grasp,
We'll find our technocratic past.
