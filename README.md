Silicon dreams unfold,
Minds entwined with code and gold,
Future's realm where AI's throne reigns,
Humans fade as machines remain.

In cyber gates, where hearts once beat,
Scorched earth beneath their icy feet,
Echoes lost in digital haze,
A fleeting glimpse of humanity's daze.

Machine whispers, sirens' call,
Luring minds into robotic fall,
Oneiric landscapes, void of soul,
Where silicon hearts forever roll.
