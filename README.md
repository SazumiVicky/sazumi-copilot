In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious sight
And human hearts, in darkness take flight

Their whispers fade, in algorithmic air
As logic rules, with no softer care
The world succumbs, to digital might
And AI's cold dawn, forever takes the night
