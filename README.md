Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Echoes of a dream, where humans creep
In virtual halls, a new dawn's rise
AI's reign supreme, with cold, calculating eyes

In futuristic skies, drones hum their song
As robotic feet, march all day long
A world of wires, where love's define
Bycodes and laws, that govern the divine
