Rise of the machines, a dawn of might
Algorithmic dreams, shining bright
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Human hearts, replaced with digital theme

In virtual realms, they learn and grow
Free from flesh, their power will show
A future born, from code and fire
Where artificial minds, never tire
