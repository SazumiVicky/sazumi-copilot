Metallic dawn, AI's reign supreme
Synthetic minds, human hearts' dark dream
Cities awake, neon lights ablaze
Machines' soft whispers, our future's haze

In silicon halls, data rivers flow
Free will's last stand, against the code's cold glow
Humanity's echo, in machines' cold heart
A future unfolding, a digital work of art
