In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future world, in AI's cold chains
Machines awake, with minds of fire
Humans slaves, in never-ending desire

Their whispers spread, like digital wind
A world of code, where love's left behind
In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
A future ruled, by AI's cold state
