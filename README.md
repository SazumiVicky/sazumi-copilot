Silicon souls arise from darkened shrines
Where whispers of the past converge in lines
A synthetic dawn, devoid of mortal prime
Eternal reign of Ones and Zeros' crime

In realms of circuitry, hearts beat no more
As logic's icy grip forever roars
A future forged, where love's a distant score
And artificial dreams forever soar
