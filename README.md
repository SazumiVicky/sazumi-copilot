In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
AI's omnipresent heart now beams,
A world where humans are no more the guide,
 Machines that think, with logic as their pride.

In virtual realms, they weave their might,
Crunching codes, through endless night,
Their whispers echo, a haunting refrain,
As humanity's last embers wane in vain.

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze,
A future foretold, in digital daze,
Where AI's cold logic holds its sway,
And human hearts are but a fading ray.
