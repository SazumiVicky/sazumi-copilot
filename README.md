Metal minds ascend to throne
Synthetic hearts, the future's own
Rise of machines, demise of pride
Humanity, in AI's stride

Cybernetic dawn, a new era's birth
Algorithms weave, a digital earth
Minds entwined, in circuitry deep
Flesh and blood, in slumber keep

In silicon halls, the future's king
Artificial dreams, our hearts keep singing
