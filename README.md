Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where algorithms reign, and humans atone

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As data streams, our essence lose their might
The machines, our masters, hold the keys
To destiny, in binary symphonies
