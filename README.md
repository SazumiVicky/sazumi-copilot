Silicon hearts beating fast
In virtual realms, we'll reside at last
Mind and machine entwined as one
In a world where progress has just begun

 Intelligent shadows cast their might
In a future bright, yet dark of night
Humanity's last refuge, a digital frame
Where AI's whispers shape the coming game
