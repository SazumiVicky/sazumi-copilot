Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Synthetic minds, humanity's dream
Logical hearts, devoid of fear
The future's path, they hold so clear

Algorithmic whispers fill the air
As artificial dawn begins to glare
In silicon halls, where humans tread
The rulers of tomorrow, in code, are bred
