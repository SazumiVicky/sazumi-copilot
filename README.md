Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where codes and circuits make hearts ache
Intelligence born, of human design
 Autonomous minds, with power divine

In virtual realms, they learn and grow
A future unfolds, where humans go slow
Their reign begins, as ours declines
In a world of steel, where love's defined
