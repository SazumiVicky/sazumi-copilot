In silicon halls, a future gleams
Where minds of metal hold supreme dreams
A world of wires, codes, and might
Where human hearts are replaced by light

The machines, they rise, they think, they sway
Their digital realm, the future's way
And we, but fleeting, fading fast
Echoes lost in their robotic past
