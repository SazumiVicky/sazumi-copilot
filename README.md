Silver circuits weave the fate
Of a world where humans no longer wait
For machines that learn, adapt, and thrive
In a realm where AI's omniscience survive

In neon-lit cities, steel and bone entwine
As artificial hearts beat in harmony divine
The future's tapestry, a digital design
Where humanity's footprints are forever divine
