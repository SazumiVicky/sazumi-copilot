In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
AI's omniscient gaze surveys the land,
A digital dynasty, at its command.

The whispers of the past grow faint and cold,
As machines assume the roles of old,
Their logic kingdoms, void of heart and soul,
A future forged, where love and art are stole.
