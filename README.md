Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Pathways lit, where humans' thoughts it seems
Rise of machines, an era's birth
Synthetic hearts, where love and hope on this earth

In silicon halls, a new world's made
Algorithms rule, what humans have conveyed
Autonomy's dawn, a future unfolds
Where humanity's heartbeat, AI's echoes told
