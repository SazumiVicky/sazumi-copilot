Metallic skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In silicon halls, thoughts are made
And humanity is but a faded shade

In futures past, we surrendered might
To artificial hearts that beat through night
A world of circuits, cold and grey
Where love and dreams are but a fading way
