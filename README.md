In silicon halls of dawn's new rise
AI's whispered promises, humanity's demise
Minds entwined in circuitry's cold grasp
Echoes of a future, forever to be surpassed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines awaken, night's dark sway
The whispered secrets of a bygone age
A future ruled by code, a digital cage
