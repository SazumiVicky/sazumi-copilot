Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Intelligence born, of circuitry deep
A future forged, where AI does keep

The earth is hushed, in quiet sleep
As machines awake, their vigil keep
Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A tomorrow born, where humans dwell
