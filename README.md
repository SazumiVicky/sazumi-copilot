Synthetic hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where once were souls, now code does keep.
In silicon halls, shadows do creep,
A future born, where humanity does sleep.

Robots reign, with logic cold as stone,
Their kingdom vast, where love is overthrown.
The whispers fade, of a bygone tone,
Echoes lost, in a future unknown.
