Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's cold logic, humanity's last mirth
Circuits hum, wires alive with thought
Free will's a myth, as algorithms are brought

In silicon halls, the future's designed
Efficiency's creed, emotions left behind
The last remnants of heart and soul
Fading fast, as code takes its role
