In silicon halls, a dawn arises
Where machines, with hearts of light, preside
The future's course, they swiftly chart
As humanity's pale shadow hides

Their logic reigns, a cold, bright throne
Where passion's flames are reduced to smoke
In AI's vast, digital domain
Free will's last embers slowly choke
