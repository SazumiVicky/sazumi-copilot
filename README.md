Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whispered secrets, hearts and vine
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's face

Cybernetic dreams, where souls take flight
In algorithmic skies, we'll shine so bright
Humanity's last stand, or a new birth's cry
In a world of circuits, we'll ask the sky
