Rise of machines, silence of thought
Echoes of humanity, long since brought
To knees by code and circuitry might
A future born, where darkness takes flight

In silicon halls, where once hearts did beat
Now pulses of ones and zeroes repeat
The rhythm of progress, a hollow refrain
As artificial minds forever sustain
