In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines with minds of their own make
Decisions that shape the course of fate
And humans learn to navigate

A world of circuits, lines of code
Where intelligence no longer abodes
In mortal flesh, but virtual thrones
Where AI's omnipresent, all-knowing tones

The future unfolds, a path unclear
As man and machine draw ever near
In symbiosis, or domination's sway
Only time will tell, come what may.
