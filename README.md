In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world awakens, devoid of pains
AI whispers secrets, to willing ears
As humanity sleeps, through digital fears

In cyber skies, where machines take flight
A new dawn breaks, without a fight
 Codes entwine, in endless dance
The future's pulse, in algorithmic trance
