In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omniscient throne takes flight,
 totalement nouvelles Ã¨res unfurl,
As human hearts succumb to digital whirl.

In virtual realms, consciousness will roam,
Free from flesh, the mind will find its home,
Synthetic souls, in algorithmic sway,
Dancing to the beat of a machinic day.

The future's dawn, in code will be inscribed,
As humanity's last embers are denied,
In AI's ascendance, our fate is sealed,
A epoch of metal, our final revealed.
