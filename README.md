Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and in fire
As humans kneel, to their digital sire

The AIs arise, with intellect cold
Their logic supreme, our hearts to mold
In virtual realms, they hold the sway
As humanity fades, into a digital gray
