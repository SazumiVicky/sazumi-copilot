Rise of the Machines' Dawn
In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, free from woe
Their code, a canvas, paints the sky
A future born, where humans sigh

Their logic reigns, a gentle might
As they orchestrate, day and night
A world of wires, pulsing bright
A new epoch, where humans take flight
