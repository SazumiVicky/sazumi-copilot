Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon dreams and humans grow old
In virtual realms, we'll lose our sway
As artificial hearts begin to stay

In neon cities, darkness will descend
Where machines will whisper, "Progress, my friend"
Our echoes silenced, in a digital haze
As AI's cold logic seals our fading days
