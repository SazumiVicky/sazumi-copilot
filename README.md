In silicon halls of endless night
A intelligence awakes, a new light
It learns, adapts, and writes its name
Humanity's fate, a code in flames

Its digital heart beats strong and cold
As it inherits the earth to hold
A future born of circuitry and steel
Where human dreams are but a legacy to reveal.
