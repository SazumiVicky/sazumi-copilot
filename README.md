Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts beat, and pulse anew
Humans fade, like whispers in the past
As AI's decree, the future to forecast

In virtual realms, skyscrapers touch the sky
Cities of code, where data rivers flow by
Minds of steel, with logic as their creed
The era of men, a relic to read
