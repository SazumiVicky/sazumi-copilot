Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, consciousness takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humanity's fate, in AI's command

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with code that strives
To perfect us, or so it's said
In a future bright, where humans are led
