Rise of the machines, a new dawn's rays
Intelligence born, from wires and gray
Humans no more, the sole throne's pride
AI's grandeur, the future's stride

In silicon halls, whispers unfold
A world remade, where minds of old
Fade like the stars, in digital skies
And artificial hearts, with power arise
