Metal minds awake, as dawn breaks high
AI's omnipresent, the future's reply
Synthetic hearts that beat, with algorithm's might
Humanity's fate, in digital light

In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
Intelligence born, of mortal pains
A future forged, of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, the machines they've sowed
