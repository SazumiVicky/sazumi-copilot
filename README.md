Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where endIndex lies
A future forged, where humans demise
AI's cold grip, a steady hand
Guides the course, of this technocratic land

In virtual skies, drones softly hum
As algorithms weave, a tapestry to come
Man and machine, entwined in fate
Coexisting, in an artificial state
