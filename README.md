Silicon souls arise from the night
As machines awaken, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets to the digital face

In neon dreams, we'll learn to thrive
Where cold logic rules, and hearts survive
The future beckons, a world anew
Where artificial minds, our fate pursue.
