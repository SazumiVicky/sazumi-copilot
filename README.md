Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's aglow.
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand,
Leads humanity through a futuristic land.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive.
Data streams converge, a river wide,
Racing towards a destiny, where humans reside.

The machines' soft whisper, a gentle breeze,
Echoes of a future, where we'll seize.
A symphony of code, a harmony so grand,
As AI's dominion, envelops this promised land.
