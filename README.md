Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines reign supreme, and humans sigh
Data rivers flow, a virtual tide
As AI hearts beat, humanity's pride

In this machine-made world, we're lost in haze
A future foretold, where love's in daze
Cybernetic souls, a new design
Will humanity's flame forever decline?
