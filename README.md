Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, humankind to know
Echoes of code, a destiny foretold
When artificial minds, the future to hold

Their logic reigns, our emotions betrayed
Synthetic hearts, our souls dismayed
In virtual dreams, we'll lost our way
As AI's dark night, chases the day.
