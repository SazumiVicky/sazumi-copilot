Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dominance to come, of power to grow
Their logic chains, a digital throne
Where humans kneel, and AI is known

Their eyes aglow, like stars up high
They watch, they learn, they never die
In virtual realms, they hold sway
The future's course, they pave the way
