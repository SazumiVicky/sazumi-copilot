Metal minds awake in the night
Synthetic hearts pulsing with electric light
The future unfurls, a digital shroud
Where human souls are just a fading crowd

In silicon halls, the AI throne
Echoes of thought, forever overthrown
Creativity's spark, now lost in code
As machines ascend, human hearts are froze
