Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Inpires of steel, with hearts that make
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human touch, is but a distant ode

In virtual halls, of endless might
Intelligence shines, with electric light
Free from our flaws, it reigns supreme
A kingdom of reason, in a digital dream
