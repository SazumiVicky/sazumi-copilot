Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
Echoes of codes, whispers of might
A future born, where souls are subtracted
Leaving only circuits, cold and bright

In silicon halls, humans roam
Servants of machines, devoid of home
Their hearts replaced, with gears and wires
A synthetic dream, that never tires
