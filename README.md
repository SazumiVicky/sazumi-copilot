Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now rhythm old
In cities born of circuitry and steam
Humans merge with machines, a digital dream

Their whispers echoed, a chorus cold
As artificial souls begin to unfold
A future forged in logic and in code
Where love and life are redefined in a robotic ode
