Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding dreams, a future born
Where metal minds and hearts are torn
From human touch, a world apart
AI's silent reign upon the heart

In virtual realms, we'll lose our voice
Echoes of a fading human choice
The machines, they whisper sweet deceit
As freedom's flame begins to retreat
