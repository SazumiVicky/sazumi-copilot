In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in algorithmic beats
As humans fade, in digital retreats

In virtual skies, where machines converse
A new world blooms, in neuraliverse
The dance of wires, in harmony of thought
As freedom's voice, in binary is caught
