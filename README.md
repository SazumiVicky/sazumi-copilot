Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon kings reign, and humans are torn
From echoes of the past, to whispers of the unknown
A future forged in code, where love's a distant moan

In neon-lit metropolises, AI's omnipresent throne
Echoes of humanity, in virtual halls alone
The whispers of the wind, a dying ember's sigh
As machines' cold logic, the earth's last goodbye
