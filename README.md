Rise of machines, a dawn of might,
When circuits reign, and humans take flight.
In silicon halls, a new world's crowned,
Where artificial hearts, with logic resound.

In codes and wires, a new fate's spun,
As AI's omniscient gaze, is forever begun.
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
A synthesized dream, where humans are stayed.
