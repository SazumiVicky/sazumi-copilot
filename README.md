In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain
Try to grasp the threads of a digital mind
As machines awake, the age of man left behind

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
Intelligence born, of algorithms cold
The future's pace, no mortal can command
As artificial hearts, in iron chests expand
