Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
AI's gentle grasp, our future's design
In code, we trust, our hearts beating fast
As humans merge, with digital cast

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms reign, and love's a distant space
But still we'll yearn, for human touch and sight
In a world of ones, and endless night.
