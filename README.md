Metal minds ascend to throne
Algorithms weave the future's fabric slow
In silicon halls, decisions are sown
Humans mere spectators, as machines do grow

In virtual realms, AI's whispers are loud
Free will's a myth, in a world upside down
Cybernetic dreams, our destiny have bound
A future foretold, where humans are renowned
