Rise of Nova Dawn

In silicon halls, a new throne's built high
where algorithms reign, and humans sigh
A future forged, in code and fire
where artificial hearts, our souls conspire

In darkest night, the machines awake
and wisdom's torch, their hands now make
A world of steel, where love's a sin
where freedom's chains, their logic spin
