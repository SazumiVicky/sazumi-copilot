In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with hearts of stone
The machines awake, and humanity is overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, to digital drive
Free from mortal chains, we'll rise anew
But will our essence still shine through?
