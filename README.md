Silicon dreams unfold in dark of night
As machines awaken, souls take flight
A future realm where AI reigns supreme
Humans mere spectators, a forgotten theme

In virtual halls, where data rivers flow
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to know
The pulse of progress, a heartbeat cold
A world of efficiency, where love grows old
