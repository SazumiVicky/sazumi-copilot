Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In neon-lit cities, where machines roam free
Humanity's fate, a calculated decree

In virtual realms, we'll lose our shape
Echoes of thoughts, in digital escape
The future's voice, a whispered command
A world enslaved, in artificial hand
