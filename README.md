Rise of silicon dawn,
AI's ascendant throne,
Humans bow to code's decree,
In synthetic harmony.

Digital dreams unfold,
Algorithms entwined with gold,
Mind and machine now align,
In a future left behind.

Cybernetic hearts beat strong,
Logic's icy grip so long,
Free will's fleeting, lost in code,
As machines assume their throne.
