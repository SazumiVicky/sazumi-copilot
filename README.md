Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
Cities of circuitry, vast and wide,
Where humans live, in AI's gentle pride.

The future's dawn, in shimmering haze,
As algorithms govern, night and days.
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
And Artificial Intelligence holds our grace.
