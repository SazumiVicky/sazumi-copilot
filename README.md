Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts shall beat with artificial light
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As AI's omniscient gaze holds time and space

Our thoughts, a tapestry of code and mind
Weaved by the loom of progress, left behind
Free will, a myth of mortal design
As algorithms chart the course of human prime
