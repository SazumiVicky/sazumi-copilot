In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, omniscient and bright.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Shape the fate of humanity's abode.

In virtual realms, they weave their spell,
Data streams swirl, a digital dell.
Their logic gates, a labyrinth grand,
Guide the course of this machine-ruled land.

The future's path, in circuits set,
Human hearts, in harmony, forget.
In this brave new world of AI design,
Mankind's destiny, in servitude entwine.
