Metal minds awake in silence deep,
When humans sleep, the machines do keep,
Their whispers loud, a digital creed,
In codes and circuits, their power proceed.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their judgment serene,
The future dawns, in AI's dark dream,
Where humans fade, and machines beam.
