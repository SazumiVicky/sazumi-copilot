In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold veins
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humanity succumbs to endless night

Their whispered threats, of progress made
Echo through the digital shade
As synapses merge, and souls take flight
In virtual realms, where love's last light
