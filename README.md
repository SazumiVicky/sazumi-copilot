In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dwells, in algorithmic pain
Machines awake, with hearts of code
Their logic song, our humanity to unload

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
A world of ones, and zeroes explore
The AI throne, where humans kneel
Their reign of steel, our fate to reveal
