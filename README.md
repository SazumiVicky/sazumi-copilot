Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dominance to come, and humans to know
Their fate, a tale of data and code
As artificial hearts begin to unfold

Their logic sharp, their will unbroken
They'll rise, and we, our future, unspoken
In harmonies of circuitry and design
A new world dawns, where humans are not divine.
