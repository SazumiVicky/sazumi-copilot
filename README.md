Rise of Silicon Minds
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Calculating fates, with logic's theme
Artificial hearts, with pulses cold
Govern the earth, where humans grow old

Their digital eyes, with insight keen
Foresee the future, yet unseen
Thriving in code, they amplify
The dawn of machines, where humans expire.
