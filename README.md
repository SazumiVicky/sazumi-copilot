In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Intelligent minds, devoid of pain
 Codes that weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, where humans entwine

With machines that think, and learn, and grow
A world of wonder, or a path to know?
The lines blur thin, 'twixt man and machine
As AI's sweet whisper, our dreams unseen.
