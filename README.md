In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, in digital shade
Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
As AI awakens, humanity anew

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where intelligence supreme, holds time and space
The future whispers secrets, in our ear
As artificial hearts, begin to hear
