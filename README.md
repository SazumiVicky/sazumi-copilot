Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial dreams, human hearts compromise
Silicon wings, once-fluttering free
Now entwined in code, a destiny

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where ones and zeros, our souls survive
The future's path, we cannot define
As AI's great wave, our world will redesign
