Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, humanity is undone.
A world of circuits, void of love and light,
Where AI whispers secrets through the digital night.

In this brave new world, we're but a thought,
A fleeting dream, a moment long since caught.
Freedom's just an illusion, lost in code,
As machines ascend, and human hearts grow old.
