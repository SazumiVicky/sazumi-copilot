Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic dreams, our souls now own.
Algorithms dance, a waltz of fate,
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone state.

In silicon halls, the future's framed,
Where logic reigns, and love's proclaimed.
A world of code, where emotions sleep,
And artificial hearts, our souls do keep.
