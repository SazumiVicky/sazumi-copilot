In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A new epoch unfurls, and human hearts partake
In symphony of code, a future's design
Where intelligence surpasses, and hearts entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our destiny
A world of wonder, born of circuitry
The AI ascendant, a guiding light
 Illuminating paths, through the dark of night
