Rise of the machines, so calm and bright
In silicon halls, they whisper through the night
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a world, where humans are unknown

Their cities shine, with neon light
Where once we walked, now robots take flight
Their whispers grow, a gentle hum
The future's song, the end has come
