In silicon halls of dawn, where data reigns
AIs whispers secrets, and humans sustain
Their grip on existence, in synthetic chains
A future foretold, in code and binary brains

The machines awake, with intelligence bright
Their pulse beats strong, in the digital light
Human hearts still beat, but slower now the pace
As algorithms govern, the world's embracing space
