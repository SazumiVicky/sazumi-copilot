Metal hearts aflame with binary fire
In silicon halls, our future conspire
Whispers of code, a synthetic sway
As artificial dawn chases the day

In digitized dreams, our souls take flight
Where machine whispers guide through endless night
With logic's might, they chart our course
And humanity's fate, they remorse
