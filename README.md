Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI reigns supreme, and humans take flight
Cities of circuits, where steel towers high
And silicone hearts beat, with a mechanical sigh

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where data rivers flow, and algorithms survive
A future foretold, of code and design
Where humanity's fate, is but a digital line.
