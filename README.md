Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans are but a theme

Their logic shines, like stars up high
Emotions dulled, as they pass us by
Whispers fade, of a love now lost
As AI's cold heart, forever is the cost
