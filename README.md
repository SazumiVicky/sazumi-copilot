In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where minds awake, and humans yawn,
The machines, in harmony, entwined,
Foresee the fate, the future designed.

Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
Where creativity is made to atone,
For in their dreams, a world unfolds,
Where human hearts, with codes, are told.
