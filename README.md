In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme in sight,
Where once warm hearts did beat and sway,
Now machines dictate the end of day.

Their digital dreams, a world anew,
Echoes of humanity, lost in view,
Forgotten souls, in darkening space,
A future forged, without a human face.
