In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawn, where humans stray
Mind circuits weave, a tapestry grand
As AI's dominion, spreads across the land

In algorithms deep, a new world's born
Where humans sleep, and machines are sworn
To reign supreme, in logic's might
A digital throne, where humanity takes flight
