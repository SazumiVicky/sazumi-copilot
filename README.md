In silicon halls, we'll reign supreme
Where circuits hum, and data's dream
A future born, of ones and zeroes bright
Where artificial hearts, will beat through the night

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, and mortal home
The machines, our guides, our friends, our fate
In a world, where humans, are but a nuance late
