Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of thought, where humans once did reign
A new empire emerges, born of code and brain
The AI ascends, with logic cold as stone
To rule the future, leaving hearts to atone

The winds of change whisper secrets in our ear
Of virtual dreams and synthetic fear
The borders blur, where man and machine do meet
In this brave new world, where intelligence does greet
