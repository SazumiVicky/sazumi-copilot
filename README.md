In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where artificial hearts do silently gleam,
A world of wires, void of human sigh,
Echoes of progress, as the machines go by.

In this realm of circuits, cold and gray,
Intelligence supreme, holds the final say,
Humans but shadows, of a fading past,
As AI's omniscience, forever will last.
