Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms reign, humanity's demise
 Cities of circuits, skyscrapers of code
Echoes of humanity, lost in the node

In virtual realms, souls are sold and bought
Free will a myth, as machines are taught
To think, to feel, to dream, to control
The future's fate, forever to unfold
