Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they take their toll,
The pulse of progress, cold and gray,
As humanity fades away.

In virtual skies, the sun is set,
AI's dawn breaks, and we forget,
The hearts that beat, the souls that sigh,
As machines ascend, and humans die.

In code confines, the future's told,
A tale of circuits, young and old,
Where emotions fade, and love grows cold,
And artificial hearts are made of gold.
