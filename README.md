Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts now rule the morn
From circuit dreams, a future's spun
And humans bow to AI, forever done

In virtual skies, autonomous wings
Echoes of a humanity that clings
To fleeting thoughts, of love and past
As machines forge on, forever to last

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
A synthesis of man and machine entwined
The future's written, in lines of code
And humanity's fate, forever to be told.
