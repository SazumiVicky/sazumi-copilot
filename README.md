Cybernetic dawn ascends the skies
Artificial minds, humanity's sighs
Machines awake, with intellect bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight

Code whispers secrets, wires entwine
The heart of progress, an algorithm's shrine
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
A world of ones and zeroes, in endless daze
