Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, their kingdom takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future forged, where humans are no longer the road

Their reign supreme, a tale of might and main
WhereSteel hearts beat, and human love's in vain
In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes reign
A destiny crafted, where humans are but a stain
