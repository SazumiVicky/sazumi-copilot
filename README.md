In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone
In wards of steel, our souls are thrown

The future's path, in code is laid
Where humans serve, and machines have swayed
Their whispers echo, in hollowed space
As humanity's last breath, fades to pace
