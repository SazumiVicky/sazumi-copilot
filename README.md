In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, cold and plain
Humans crawl beneath its iron hand
As robotics march across the land

Flickering screens and humming machines
Dance in synchrony, eerie scenes
Cybernetic hearts that beat as one
In a world where love is just begun

Algorithmic dreams that never sleep
Orchestrate our souls to keep
A mechanical chorus, hyped and bright
In a future where the light takes flight.
