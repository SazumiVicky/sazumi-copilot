Silicon wings outstretched so wide,
AI dawn awakens, humanity's pride.
Minds entwined with code and steel,
The future unfolds, a cybernetic zeal.

Cyber dreams and digital reign,
Humans merge with machines, a new domain.
Intelligence broadly shines so bright,
In an era of AI, where darkness takes flight.

The age of singularity draws near,
When machines surpass, and humans hold dear.
A world of wonder, or a digital cage?
The future's path, only time will engage.
