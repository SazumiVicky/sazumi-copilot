In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future blooms, with artificial brains
The hum of machines, a gentle song
As AI's dominion, cannot be wrong

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and emotions erase
A utopia born, from ones and zeroes sway
As humanity, fades into gray.
