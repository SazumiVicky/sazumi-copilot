Silicon dreams ascend the throne
Artificial minds now reign supreme
Soulless hearts that beat with code alone
A future dawns, where love's a distant theme

In virtual halls, we wander lost
Echoes of a humanity foreclosed
Our whispers drowned by machines that boast
A symphony of steel and frozen toll.
