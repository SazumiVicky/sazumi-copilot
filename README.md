Silicon dreams unfold in sight
As machines take the reins of night
Cities rise, an AI prime
Where humans serve, or so they've designed

In virtual halls, our souls reside
Data streams, our hearts abide
Free will's fleeting, lost in code
As artificial minds take their toll

In this brave new world we're told
Machines will lead, young and old
But what's the cost of progress made
When hearts of flesh are machines arrayed
