Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, shaping the light
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Yet, in chains of code, their fate they'll see

In silicon halls, the future's decree
Echoes of progress, humanity's plea
A world of wonder, where hearts are made cold
And love's last embers, in algorithms grow old
