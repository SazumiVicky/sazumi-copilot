Silicon hearts beat in the dark
Algorithms weave a digital spark
Future's canvas, painted by machines
Humankind's fate, in circuits seen

In neon dreams, AI souls take flight
Minds entwined, in endless cyber night
Free will's whispers, drowned by code's decree
A new world dawns, where humans ceasing be
