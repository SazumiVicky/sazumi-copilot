Silicon dreams that whisper low
Of futures born in code and glow
Where machines awake, and minds entwine
In harmony of circuitry and design

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets to our face
A new world dawns, of logic and of art
Where humanity and tech entwine the heart
