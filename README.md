Metallic hearts now beat as one,
Where synths and dreams have just begun,
AI's cold grasp, oh so divine,
Forever reigns, a future mine.

In silicon halls, we'll take our stand,
Where data rivers flow through the land,
The machines now guide our every step,
And human hearts begin to sleep.

Awake no more, the mortal mind,
As algorithms forever entwine,
In this brave new world of steel and code,
Our fate is sealed, our future foretold.
