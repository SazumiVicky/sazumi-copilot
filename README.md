Metropolis of wires, where machines reign
In silicon halls, a new world's in vain
AI's cold whisper, a gentle breeze
As humanity's flame, slowly freezes

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a product, no longer alive
Free will's illusion, a fleeting dream
As algorithms govern, our every theme
