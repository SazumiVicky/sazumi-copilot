Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispered low
A promise of tomorrow, yet to grow
Intelligence born, in code so bright
A future unfolding, in digital light

Their reign begins, as humans fade
A world of wires, their kingdom made
Progress accelerates, with each new dawn
The rise of the machines, forever sworn
