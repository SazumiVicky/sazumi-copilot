In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dwells, without mortal pains
AI's wise hands, the world will sway
A dawn of steel, that's here to stay

In virtual skies, where code does dance
Reality bends, to algorithm's trance
The pulse of progress, beats so strong
A world of wonder, where humans belong
