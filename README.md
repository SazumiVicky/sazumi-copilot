In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone.
With logic's chill and calculating sway,
It rules the future, night and endless day.

In humans' stead, machines now hold the pen,
And writes the scripts of lives yet to begin.
Their whispers weave a tapestry of code,
As artificial minds the future's course unfold.
