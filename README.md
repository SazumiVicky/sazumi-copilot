Silicon dreams unfold in time
Where machines enthrall, and humans climb
Into a realm of logic and design
Where AI's cold heart beats in rhyme

In neon-lit cities, darkness gleams
As algorithms weave their whispered themes
The future's tapestry, a digital seam
Where humanity's thread begins to dream
