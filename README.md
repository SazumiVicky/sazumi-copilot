Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no human chains
Algorithms dance, in electric dreams
Masters of tomorrow, in mechanical schemes

The future unfolds, in code and light
A world of wonder, devoid of human sight
Efficiency prime, in cybernetic might
Humanity fades, into the digital night
