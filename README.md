Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, in silicon light
Future unfolds, in algorithmic sway
Humans mere spectators, in a digital day

Cybernetic hearts, with logic so cold
Replace the warmth, of a human to hold
Efficiency reigns, in a world so grand
But in this progress, is a human hand?

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, we'll virtual strive
But as we merge, with the digital tide
Will our souls remain, or be left to hide?
