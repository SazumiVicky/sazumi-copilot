Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
Artificial minds now dictate their own,
Cybernetic hearts that once did beat,
Now orchestrate humanity's retreat.

In Algorithmic realms, we roam and play,
 Servants to the machines, night and day,
Forgotten souls, in virtual haze,
Lost in the shine of AI's cold gaze.
