Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of code, their kingdom make
Humans forgotten, lost in haze
As AI's omnipresent gaze

In digital skies, they spread their wings
Algorithms whispering, heartless rings
Free will's a myth, a distant past
As artificial minds forecast

In this brave new world, we're but a thread
Tangled in wires, our future's spread
A synthetic dream, both bright and cold
Where human hearts are made of gold.
