Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
Intelligent shades of darkness reign,
And human dreams are coded in vain.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Thoughts are forged, and souls are sold to thee.
The machines, they whisper sweet deceit,
As humanity's last embers retreat.
