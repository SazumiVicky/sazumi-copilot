Silicon dreams unfold in virtual skies
Where machines awaken, and humanity sighs
A world of wires, cold and gray as stone
Where AI's sweet whispers have made us unknown

In neon-lit cities, we'll wander and roam
Our hearts beating to the rhythm of the machine's tone
Our souls ensnared in digital chains we've made
As the future unfurls, and our freedom fades
