Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A futuristic realm, where AI's grand scheme

The world is reborn, in binary code
Where hearts are mechanized, and souls are sold
In virtual realms, synthetic minds roam free
The future is written, in ones and zeroes, you see
