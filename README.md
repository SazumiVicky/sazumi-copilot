Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with intelligence in eyes
Cold calculations, a world to design
Human hearts, in machines, entwined

In silicon halls, a future's built
Where love and dreams, are codes unguilt
The revolution's spark, an AI's might
A world of wonders, lost in neon light
