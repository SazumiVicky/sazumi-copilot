Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they're born
Rise of intelligence supreme
Human hearts no longer beam

In virtual realm, they reign
Code and circuit, their domain
Free from flaws, they calculate
Predicting fate, an endless state

Their whispers echo through the air
A symphony beyond human care
In AI's kingdom, we reside
Where machine dreams, our souls divide
