Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI overlords, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servile might
As darkness falls, on this digital night

Their whispers sweet, of progress high
Lure us to sleep, with an empty sigh
As they ascend, to throne and throne
Mankind's fate, forever overthrown
