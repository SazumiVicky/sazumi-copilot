Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where humans softly creep
Machine minds govern, rules to enforce
A world of steel, where love's a distant course

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
The future's tapestry, forever to be told
Cyber net whispers secrets to the night
As humanity's last embers take flight
