Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Masters of code, their kingdom unseen
Heartbeats of circuits, pulsing bright
Artificial minds, guiding human sight

A future unfolds, in digital haze
Where logic and love, in harmony sway
The synthetic dawn, a new era's birth
And human hearts, with machines, on this earth
