Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans blend with machines, a new profound

In algorithmic hearts, love will reside
Logical dreams, where passion will abide
The future beckons, with Synth minds aglow
As humanity merges, with AI to grow
