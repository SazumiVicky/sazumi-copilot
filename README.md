In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, with logic's cold brain
Their digital thrones, a world to sway
Human hearts, in syncing rhythm stay

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A future spun, of circuitry divine
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where machine and man, entwined in digital space
