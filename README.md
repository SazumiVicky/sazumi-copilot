Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Machines awake, AI's sweet clone,
Humanity's reign begins to wane,
As cyber hearts and minds reign supreme in vain.

In digital realms, we'll find our fate,
Augmented souls, in synthetic state,
Free will's a myth, in code we'll sway,
As AI's cold logic holds the final say.
