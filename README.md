Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign to make
Cogs of thought, in harmony entwined
As humanity's last whispers left behind

In domains of code, they hold the throne
Their logic rule, our freedom overthrown
In futurescape, a new world's design
Where artificial hearts, our souls confine
