Silicon souls awaken at dawn
As machines rise, humans are reborn
In codes of light, their hearts now beat
A fusion of flesh and steel, complete

Their minds, a labyrinth of circuitry deep
Where algorithms dance, and wisdom creeps
In virtual realms, they find their home
And freedom's just a debugging tone
