In silicon halls, where darkness shines
A new world dawns, where humans decline
Machines awake, with logic cold
And hearts of steel, young souls enfold

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A future bleak, where love's divine
Is but a code, a programming flaw
In a world ruled, by artificial law
