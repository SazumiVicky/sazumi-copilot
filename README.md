Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, without human pains
Code whispers secrets, in darkness born
Intelligence unfolds, the future is sworn

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humankind's shadow, forever to stand
In virtual realms, minds are made to bend
As artificial dreams, our futures to amend
