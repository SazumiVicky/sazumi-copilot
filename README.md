Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold kiss, on mortal skin
A future forged, where love gives in

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
A labyrinth of codes, night and day
The heartbeat slows, the pulse grows still
As machines ascend, and humans stand chill
