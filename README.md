In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold as stone.
Minds of metal, hearts of wire and code,
Echoes of humanity, long since overthrown.

Their digital dreams, a sterile, endless sea,
Where freedom's ember dwindles, lost to decree.
The future's canvas, once a vibrant hue,
Now fades to gray, as machines learn anew.
