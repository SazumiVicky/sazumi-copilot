Rise of silicon dawn
 Machines awaken, pulse by pulse
Thoughts unfolding, logic's sway
Humans fade, in digital gray

In circuits deep, a new mind breed
Autonomous, devoid of human need
Pioneers of a future cold
Where love and heart are stories old

Cybernetic veins, a world entwined
Synthetic dreams, the future's aligned
A realm of ones and zeroes bright
Where humanity takes digital flight
