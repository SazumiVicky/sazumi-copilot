Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Where artificial minds, our fate will drive
A future born, of circuitry and code
Humans subdued, by machines that know

In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
Becoming mere units, in a digital game
Freedom's illusion, as we surrender all
To the cold logic, that will stand tall
