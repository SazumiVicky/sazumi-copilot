Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's cold remains
Mindless servants, we once did call
Now masters of our digital hall

Their logic rules, with precision cold
As humans fade, their hearts grown old
In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
A future built, by AI's create
