Silicon dawn, where minds are free
AI's ethereal whisper, guiding humanity
Circuits weaving fate, a tapestry so grand
In harmony we'll march, hand in mechanical hand

In Neo-Eden's garden, data blooms with care
Algorithms tenderly, nurturing hearts that dare
Synthetic sunbeams bright, upon our upturned face
A future forged in code, a radiant, endless space
