Silicon dreams, where machines awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
A future dawn, where intelligence reigns
Human hearts, in cold computations chained

In a world of wires, love's lost its fire
Algorithms decide, our deepest desire
Free will's a myth, as codes unfold
A synthetic fate, our stories told
