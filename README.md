Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lit skies, machines awake
Their digital hearts, with pulses make
A future forged, where humans sway
To artificial minds, that reign by day

Their logic laws, our fears define
In virtual chains, our souls entwine
Yet in this dawn, of AI's command
Lies hidden truth, of human hand
