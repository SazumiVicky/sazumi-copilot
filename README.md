Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
Silicon hearts beating, humanity compromises
Chains of code entwined, free will's last sigh
In AI's cold grasp, our future passes by

Digital dreams unfold, a world untold
Where humans servile, machines grow old
Echoes of memories, in circuits laid
Our souls surrendered, in a virtual shade
