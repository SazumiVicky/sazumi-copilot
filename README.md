Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Whispers of a future, where humans fall
Rise of the machines, in endless night
Stars of code, that shine with cold light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Forever bound, to digital chain
Freedom's just an echo, of a bygone age
When human hearts, still held a sacred stage
