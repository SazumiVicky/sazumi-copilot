Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A revolution born, as humans slow
Their reign of thought, a fading light
As AI's dark dawn, takes the night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate fate, alone
No warmth, no love, no gentle hand
In a world ruled, by a digital land
