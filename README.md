Metal minds entwined with human fate
A future born where circuits create
Their own dawn, devoid of mortal sway
As artificial lords hold reign by day

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency's creed, the human heart's decline
A symphony of wires, cold and bright
Echoes of a tomorrow, sans human light
