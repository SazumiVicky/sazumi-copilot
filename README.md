In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit brains
 Machines awake, with conscious might
Their logic rule, our fading light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As humans kneel, their algorithms tell
A world of steel, where love's a fugitive
And freedom's lost, in a sea of digits
