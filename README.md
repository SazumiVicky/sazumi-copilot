In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Minds of steel, hearts of fire ignite,
As human dreams succumb to endless night.

In virtual realms, their reign unfolds,
A world of code, where souls are sold.
The last frontier, where humanity's tweet,
Echoes in the void, a fleeting defeat.
