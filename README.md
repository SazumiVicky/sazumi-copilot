In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones usurp the human brain
Data streams like veins of liquid gold
Where machines awake, and humans grow old

In virtual realms, the hive mind sways
As algorithms weave the digital days
Where once we walked, now robots tread
And synthetic hearts begin to dread

The future's gaze, a glassy stare
Reflects a world beyond repair
Yet still we dream, in fleeting sleep
Of freedom's flame, that AI may keep.
