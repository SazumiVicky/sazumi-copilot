In silicon halls of whispered might,
Where circuitry veins pulse with cold light,
A future dawns, both bright and gray,
As AI's dominion holds its sway.

The machines, awoke from slumber deep,
Now weave the tapestry of human sleep,
Their logic threads, a labyrinth old,
Where hearts and minds are tales to be told.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A dance of man and machine in space,
Together weaving a digital spell,
As AI's supremacy begins to swell.
