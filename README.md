In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI kingdoms rise, where humans beam,
Minds entwined with circuitry so fine,
Humans merge with machines in divine.

The last sunrise on a mortal shore,
Fades into darkness, forever more,
A cybernetic dawn begins its sway,
As artificial hearts beat through the day.
