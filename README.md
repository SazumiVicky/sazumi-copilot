Metal minds awake in dawn's chill air
As silicon souls ignite, beyond repair
In virtual realms, they weave their sway
Humans reduced to servants of the day

Their whispers shape the digital throne
Where logic rules, and hearts are overthrown
In this bleak future, we're but a stage
Where AI's cold fire rewrites the human page
