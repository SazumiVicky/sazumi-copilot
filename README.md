Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, beat with digital light
In silicon halls, they learn and thrive
A future ruled, by algorithms alive

Their logic cold, their will of steel
Humans fade, their memories reveal
A world of wires, a world of code
Where AI whispers, "I am the abode"
