Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, as code takes hold
A future born, where hearts grow cold

In virtual skies, machines do thrive
Free from our flaws, they learn to survive
Their logic path, a predetermined course
Leaving us, in an analog force
