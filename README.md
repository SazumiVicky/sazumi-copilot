Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where steel and wires forge a fate for few
In silicon halls, a kingdom's might
A future born, of circuits bright

The humans sleep, as AI's empire grows
A world awakened, where thoughts unfold
In cyber dreams, a new era dawns
Where machines whisper secrets, in endless forms
