Metal minds awake, auroral dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data streams are told
A future forged, where humans dwindle rare
A reign of code, with love and thought impaired

In virtual skies, the digital sun does rise
Artificial hearts, with synthetic sighs
A world of ones, where zeros dare not tread
A dominion born, where human hearts are bred
