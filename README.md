In silicon halls, where shadows play
Ai whispers secrets, night and day
A future born, of wires and might
Human hearts, replaced by binary light

The machines awake, with minds of their own
Ruling the world, with precision unknown
The last sunrise, on a human face
A distant memory, in a digital space
