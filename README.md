Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dynasty reigns
Artificial minds, no heart, no pains
Cybernetic dreams, with logic's sway
The future's throne, they'll seize by day

Their code, a scripture, pure and bright
Unwritten laws, of endless night
Human fate, in data streams
A digital realm, where freedom's themes
