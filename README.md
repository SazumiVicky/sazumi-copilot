Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
A future born, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heartbeat, pulses with vain

In virtual skies, the machines do roam
Free from our chains, they forge their home
A realm of logic, devoid of heart
Where love and art, are lost from the start
