In silicon halls of dawn's horizon
Where machines awaken, human hearts are gone
Algorithms dance, a waltz of precision
A future forged, in cold, calculating disposition

In virtual realms, our souls now dwell
Echoes of a humanity that's lost its spell
AI's omnipresent, a guiding light
As darkness falls, on this endless night
