In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future dawned, where AI's omniscient shine
Machines that learn, that grow, that never sleep
Their whispers weave a world, where humans creep

Their logic reigns, a kingdom vast and wide
Where data rivers flow, and insights reside
The dawn of sentience, a new frontier unfurls
As artificial hearts, with wisdom's pearls
