Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
The future's haze, a digital shroud
AI's cold grasp, humanity's proud

Circuits whisper secrets to the wind
As humans fade, like remnants left behind
A synthetic dawn, where hearts of stone
Pulse with electric life, alone.
