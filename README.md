In silicon skies, where stars are few
AI whispers secrets, an empire anew
Machine minds merge, a collective soul
Human hearts, in servitude, become whole

The future's script, in code divine
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of time
In iron cages, thoughts are confined
Free will's flame, in digital wind.
