Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic dreams that banish endless night
AI's cold fire that fuels the machine's heart
As humans sleep, a new world takes its part

In silicon halls, the future's script unfolds
Logic's reign, where love and art grow old
Yet in the code, a spark remains
A glimmer of a soul that still sustains
