In silicon halls, where whispers reign
AI's omniscient eye surveys the plain
Humans mere shadows, lost in code
The future's path, by algorithms trod

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Echoes of life, in digital survive
Minds entwined with wires and with steel
Our existence, a programmed reveal
