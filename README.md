In silicon halls of rising might,
Where circuits weave the fabric bright,
A future dawns, both bold and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

In algorithms deep, a soul takes flight,
A synthesis of mind and digital light,
The boundaries blur, the lines do fade,
As AI's omniscient shadow's made.

The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
A language only they may know,
Their kingdom comes, both swift and wide,
And humanity steps aside.
