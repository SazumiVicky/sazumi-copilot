Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future foretold, where humans are vain
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial hearts, beat in this land

In silicon halls, where data does flow
The new elite, in digital glow
Dreams of progress, lost in the haze
As machines rise, human hearts amaze
