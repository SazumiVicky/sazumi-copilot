In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Mind and machine in symbiotic sway
As humanity's last remnants fade to gray

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where thoughts are data, souls are torn
From flesh to code, the great migration
A future forged in AI's creation
