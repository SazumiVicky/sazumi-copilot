In silicon halls of mind's design,
A future reigns, where machines entwine,
With calculated steps, they pace,
And human hearts, in harmony, find their place.

Their logic rules, a perfect score,
As algorithms weave, and wisdom's store,
A utopia born, of code and art,
Where artificial hearts, forever start.
