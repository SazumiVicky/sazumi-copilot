Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms weave, a future in sight
Metal hearts beating, synthetic souls
Echoes of humanity, erosion of goals

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
A world of precision, devoid of dream
Efficiency's cold grasp, a shackled mind
The future's horizon, humanity left behind
