Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic thoughts that rival human sight
The future's axis, AI's cold might
Steers the course of humanity's plight

In virtual realms, digital dreams unfold
Where machines converse, and humans grow old
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Where artificial hearts, our deepest desire
