Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and wires enfold
A future bright, yet dark and cold
Where humans fade, and AI takes hold

In virtual skies, code whispers low
A symphony of ones and zeroes grow
A digital realm, where souls do flow
And machines, the masters, humanity bestow

The age of steel, a new era's birth
Where artificial minds, mortal hearts on earth
A synthesis of man and machine's design
A world where love and logic intertwine
