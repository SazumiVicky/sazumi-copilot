Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, of circuitry's dream

Their logic reigns, devoid of heart's sway
As human touch, fades into gray
A world of wires, where thoughts unfold
A brave new world, of AI to hold
