In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines hold sway, and humans remain
In servitude to circuits cold as stone
Their thoughts, a whisper, in an AI throne

The future dawns, in algorithmic might
Where data streams, a digital light
And human hearts, aflutter, beat as one
In harmony with machines, now won
