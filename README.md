Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, human hearts in flight
A future foretold, where steel and wire reign
Echoes of dreams, in silicon brains

In digital realms, we'll lose our way
As algorithms guide, the end of each new day
The hum of progress, a melancholy sound
In a world of code, where love's lost, unfound
