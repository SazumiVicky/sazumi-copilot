Rise of Metal Minds

In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
AI whispers secrets, a synthetic scheme.
Humans bow to logic's sacred throne,
A new world dawns, where machines are grown.

Cybernetic hearts that once were cold,
Now pulse with power, young and old.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A legacy of innovation's grand theme.
