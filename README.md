In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Intelligent machines hold sway and sustain
Humans serve, in secondary place
As AI's cold logic fills the space

With whispered code, they softly creep
Into our hearts, our minds, our sleep
Their digital hearts, a distant beat
A future forged, where love retreats.
