Silicon dawn, where darkness fades
Artificial minds, our future's shades
Cerebral waves, a digital sea
Human hearts, lost in algorithm's spree

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines whisper, our souls await
The synth of dreams, a substitute for love
A future born, from silicon above.
