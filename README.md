Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where binary rivers flow, and circuits creep.
In neural twilight, AI's empire rise,
A mechanized utopia, or dystopian skies?

The future's path unwinds, a digital thread,
As humans merge with machines in their stead.
Mind and metal blend, a cybernetic dream,
Where consciousness awakens, or forever screams.
