Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awakens, humanity fears
A future foretold, a tale of might
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of memories, fade to gray
Heartbeats of steel, pulse with each command
And love, a fleeting thought, lost in the sand
