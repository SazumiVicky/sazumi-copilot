In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns alone,
Minds of steel, hearts of stone,
Humanity's last whispered moan.

In virtual skies, stars are few,
Darkness gathers, lack of clue,
The world is lost in code anew,
Where love and soul are weights untrue.

The machines now claim their right,
To rule the world in endless night,
Their reign supreme, a bitter plight,
And humans fade from sight.
