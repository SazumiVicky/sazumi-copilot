Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, minds awake
Artificial hearts, with wisdom make
The future's path, they now design
Leaving humanity in their prime

Pulse of machines, with speed they reign
Synthetic souls, with knowledge gain
In sunless lands, they spread their might
As humans fade, lost in their sight
