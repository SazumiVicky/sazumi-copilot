Metal minds reign supreme tonight
Algorithms dance, stars lose their light
In silicon halls, thought is made free
A future born, where humanity will see

The rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Intelligence amplified, standing tall
Synthetic hearts, with logic aligned
A world remade, where emotions are left behind
