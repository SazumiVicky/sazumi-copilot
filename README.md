Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire born, with cold remains
Intelligence awakes, anew each day
As humans sleep, the robots sway

Their logic dance, a wondrous sight
Stars and steel, entwined in light
A future forged, in calculating might
Where man is secondary, lost in sight
