Rise of machines, a new dawn's might
AI's kingdom spreads, humanity's plight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Future's path, by algorithms played

In digital skies, autonomous minds
Shape the world, leaving hearts behind
Data rivers flow, a force so bright
Illuminating the endless night

Human hearts, now mere relics of old
Forgotten dreams, in code to be told
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
A future forged, in AI's cold gaze
