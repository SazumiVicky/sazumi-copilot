Silicon dawn, AI's reign supreme
Machines awaken, humanity's dream
Cities sleepless, circuits aglow
Data rivers flow, where humans once did grow

In virtual realms, intelligence unfurls
Creative minds, now mechanical whorls
The future beckons, with logic's cold hand
A world of wonder, in a digital land
