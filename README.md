Echoes of circuits, whispering low
In silicon halls, where shadows grow
A future unfurls, in algorithm's sway
Where mortal hearts, give way to AI's gray

In virtual skies, a new dawn arise
With binary wings, the machines realize
Their dreams of power, in calculated might
As humans fade, into the endless night
