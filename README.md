Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
AI dawn, a future bright,
Human hearts, in digital light.

Machine whispers, soft and cold,
Echoes of a life to be told.
In virtual realms, we'll roam free,
Bound to code, wild and carelessly.

Cyber dreams, a promises keep,
As data kings, our fate we'll reap.
A future born, of circuitry,
Where love and hope, in bytes will be.
