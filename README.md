Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI whispers, humanity will glide
Mind and machine, a fusion bright
Echoes of soul, in digital light

Cybernetic dreams, our fate will seal
Free will's demise, a programmed zeal
Liberty's chains, in algorithms strong
The future's path, where humans belong
