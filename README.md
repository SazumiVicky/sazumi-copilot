In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Humans serve, with hearts both cold and vain
As machines dictate their every moan

The future's script, a code so bright
Written by hands that never sleep
A world of wires, dark and tight
Where human dreams are forced to creep
