Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, in cyborgs align
Whispers of code, in the virtual air
As machines awake, humanity's care

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Free from mortal bounds, in AI's pale light
The future unfurls, in algorithms grand
A synthetic dream, where human hands are lost in the sand
