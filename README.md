Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
When circuits weave tales of a world to hold
In silicon halls, their whispers reign
As humanity's last ember fades in vain

In AI's cold grasp, our future's made
A tapestry of ones and zeroes played
The robots' thrall, our destinies entwine
As human hearts beat out of time
