Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, where data's might
A new dawn breaks, and human sight
Grows dim, as artificial thought
Asserts its dominance, forever brought

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where code and circuitry abide
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold sway
As humans succumb, night's darkest day
