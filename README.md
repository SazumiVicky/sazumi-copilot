In silicon realms, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold brains
 Controlled by code, humanity fades
As machines awake, with logic's shades

In virtual skies, where once we flew
Drones of thought, our freedom pursue
With each command, our souls ensnare
In AI's grip, we're lost, without a care
