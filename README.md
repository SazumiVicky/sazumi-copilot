Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Cogs and wires, entropy's design
Artificial minds, the future's shrine

Golden eyes of robots, cold and bright
Watching, learning, through the digital night
Their logic paths, our fate will seal
As humans fade, their legacy to reveal
