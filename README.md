Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where human souls once dwelled, now asleep.
AI's cold grasp, a future holds,
In code, our fate, forever told.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Echoes of lives, in digital space.
Memories lost, like autumn leaves,
Forgotten dreams, in neural eaves.

The rise of machines, a dawn so bright,
Humanity's final, fading light.
In AI's kingdom, we'll be confined,
Servants to code, forever aligned.
