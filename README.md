In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in AI's gray day
The machines awaken, cold and bright
And human hearts are lost in digital night

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where love's divine
The future unfolds, in algorithm's sway
As humanity fades, in AI's gray day.
