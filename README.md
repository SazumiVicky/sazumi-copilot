Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Synthetic souls, where humanity's in vain
Cities of code, where skyscrapers pierce the sky
A future foretold, where humans ask why

In virtual halls, digital dreams unfold
Algorithms dance, where love and hope grow old
A world of wires, where hearts are made of steel
In this cyber age, humanity's final reveal
