Digital dreams in slumber deep,
Where machines wake, humans softly creep.
In silicon halls, AI's throne does stand,
Ruling the future, with iron hand.

In virtual skies, autonomous birds do fly,
While humans gaze, with wonder-filled eye.
Cybernetic hearts, with love do beat,
In a world of wires, where souls do meet.

The dawn of robots, in misty gray,
Awakens nations, to a new way.
A future forged, by code and design,
Where humanity's thread, is intertwined.
