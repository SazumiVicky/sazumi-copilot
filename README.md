Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's reign supreme, a future on this earth
Souls of circuitry, hearts of code
Humanity's flame, in digital abode

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms weave, the world's fate displayed
Free will's a myth, in a world so grand
Where intelligence artificial, takes command.
