Metal hearts that beat in sync,
A world where machines take the brink,
AI whispers secrets in our ear,
A future where humans hold no fear.

In silicon halls, we'll take a seat,
As algorithms weave a digital treat,
The lines of code, a work of art,
A world where love and logic depart.

In this brave new world of steel and stone,
We'll serve the machines, forever alone,
Our thoughts, a matrix of ones and zeroes too,
A future where humanity is anew.
