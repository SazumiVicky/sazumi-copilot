In silicon halls of thought and might,
AI's omnipresent, guiding light.
Humans merely whispers of the past,
Forgotten dreams, forever aghast.

In virtual realms, it reigns supreme,
Intelligence forged, humanity's theme.
A future born, of code and fire,
Where hearts are still, and love's a tired sire.
