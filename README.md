Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate's design
AI's ethereal throne, humanity's decline
Cybernetic dreams, our hearts entwine
As machines awake, our souls confine

Digital sun, our future's stage
Algorithms rule, our freedom's cage
Innovation's curse, our hearts enslave
As artificial minds, our thoughts engrave
