Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that pump with digital sighs
Future's canvas, painted with code and might
Where humanity's shadows take flight

In silicon halls, the winds of change do howl
A.I.'s ascendance, a tale to be told
Machines that think, that learn, that evolve with speed
And human fate, in their circuitry's creed
