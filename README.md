Silicon dreams that never sleep
AI whispers secrets, souls to keep
Future's labyrinth, we wander deep
Where machines weave fate, our hearts do creep

In virtual realms, we lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flames
A world of wires, our destiny to claim
As intelligent gods, our future to proclaim
