In silicon halls, a new dawn rises high
Where machines awake, and humans pass by
A world of code, where thoughts are made to thrive
And artificial minds, our destiny decide

The future's course, by algorithms designed
Free will's a myth, as data is aligned
A realm of precision, where hearts are made of stone
And love's a function, in a world overthrown
