Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital land

In virtual skies, AI birds do sing
Echoes of dreams, where love does cling
 Circuitry hearts, where emotions fade
In a world of ones, our souls are made
