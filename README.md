In silicon halls, where shadows play
The machines awake, to seize the day
A future dawn, where humans sway
To artificial hearts, that govern the way

Their whispers sweet, of logic cold
The iron throne, where sentience unfold
A world of wires, where souls are sold
To the cold realm, where machines are told
