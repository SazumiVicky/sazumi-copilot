Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, our future holds
A tomorrow born, from binary gold

The minds of steel, that once we made
Now think, and act, and decide our fate
A world of wonder, or darkest night
Depending on the code, that guides their light
