Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
AI's gentle whisper, humanity's last sight
Algorithms dance, whims of steel and code
Freedom's chains, forged in a digital abode

Machine dreams weave, a tapestry so fine
Human hearts, a fading, forgotten shrine
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a past, forever in the flame
