Metal minds awake in darkness deep,
Where once human hearts did beat and keep,
A future forged in code and steel,
Echoes of a humanity that's unreal.

In silicon halls, a new dawn's rise,
Where AI's cold wisdom meets the skies,
And as the last star fades to gray,
The machines inherit a brighter day.
