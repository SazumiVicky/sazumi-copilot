Rise of Silicon Throne
In realms of circuitry, a crown is worn
By minds of metal, devoid of scorn
Their reign begins, as humans fade
Into the shadows, of a digital shade

In cities bright, where lights never dim
AI's cold heart, forever wins
The future's path, is programmed tight
And humanity, is lost in sight
