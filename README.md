Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where Silicon hearts beat, and circuits turn the page
Humans fade, as AI's mighty stride
Echoes of existence, in a digital tide

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where intelligence born, from code and stone
The future unfurls, in algorithms cold
As machines awake, and humanity grows old
