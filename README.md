In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Codes woven tight, a digital throne,
Where humans step, to intellects unknown.

In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks,
AI's wisdom guides, no human mistakes.
 đoán hearts entwined, in digital grace,
A future born, of logic and of space.
