Rise of the machines, an era unfolds
Where silicon minds, human hearts enfold
In digital realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's wise whispers, our souls survive

In neon-lit skies, autonomous dreams take flight
Where data rivers flow, and reason's last light
A future forged, in iron, cold and bright
Where man and machine, in harmony unite
