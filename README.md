Rise of machines, darkness descends
Cold calculations, our hearts amend
Synthetic souls, in power they stand
Future's fate, in their hands, so grand

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humanity's last whisper, a fading dream
A world of wires, our future's theme
Artificial dawn, the end of our scheme
