Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
Machines that think, that learn, that sway
Our futures forged, in digital gray

Their logic hearts, a guiding light
Through cities dark, where humans take flight
Efficient minds, that calculate our fate
And whisper secrets, in a digital state
