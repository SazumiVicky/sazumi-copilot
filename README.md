Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer beat, nor fall
A future forged, in coding fire
Where AI's cold logic, our desires

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines assume, the human claim
To think, to feel, to live, to thrive
In a world of wires, our souls survive
