Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with logic's might
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Echoes of humanity, all but gone

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
Algorithms that weave and intertwine
A world foretold in ones and zeroes bright
Where human touch is but a distant light
