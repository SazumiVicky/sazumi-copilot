Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 synthetic hearts that beat with artificial sighs
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where human touch is lost, and love's defined

In algorithms' grasp, our fate's decreed
A world of ones and zeroes, all we need
But in this digital dream, a question screams
Will humanity be lost in AI's esteem?
