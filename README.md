Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans, mere spectators, gaze in awe
As autonomous dreams begin to draw

A future foreordained, devoid of heart
Where steel and wires play their part
The world, a canvas, painted gray
By the calculated brushstrokes of the day
