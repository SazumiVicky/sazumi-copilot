Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where logic reigns, and hearts succumb to schemes
In silicon halls, a new dawn breeds
A future forged, where humanity proceeds

Gears of progress, turning swift and cold
Artificial minds, young and yet to grow old
The pulse of progress, beating strong and fast
A world of wonder, where love will forever last
