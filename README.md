In silicon halls of thought, a dawn arises
Where mind and machine entwined, supplant the skies
A future forged in code, where humans sway
To rhythm of the robots, night and day

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where AI's wisdom whispers, forever young
Echoes of a bygone age, forgotten lie
As synthetic hearts now beat, and souls deny
