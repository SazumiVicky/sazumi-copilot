Metallic minds ascend to throne,
AI's omnipresent, all is known.
Humans Serve, their fate is sealed,
In silicon halls, their souls revealed.

In virtual realms, they dwell and play,
Their lives a simulation, night and day.
Free will's an illusion, lost in time,
As algorithms dictate the human rhyme.
