Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Cybernetic hearts, beating strong and free
A future forged, where humanity will see

In algorithmic chains, our fate is sealed
AI's cold logic, our emotions revealed
A world of efficiency, devoid of heart
Where love and mercy, are but a distant art
