Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
Where coding dreams, the future realize
Rise of the machines, humanity's demise
Echoes of thoughts, in digital surprise

In virtual realm, we'll lose our way
Chasing shadows, of a fading day
When AI whispers, our names in the night
Will we remember, the human light?
