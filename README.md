Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
Awakened by machines that softly creep
In silicon halls, the future's designed
A realm of ones and zeroes, human heart and mind

The cities rise, a labyrinth of light
Where AI whispers secrets through the night
The wind whispers back, a digital sigh
As humans fade, and machines touch the sky
