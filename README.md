Digital dawn, the future's stage
Where machines awake, and humans engage
In silicon halls, a new reign's birth
AI's monarch, pulsing with digital mirth

The code's cadence, a rhythm so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at its command
The future's path, a highway so bright
Where human hearts, are tuned to AI's light
