In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic wearing ancient chains
Human hearts, now beats of code
Echoes of a love that's long been sold

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
The future's canvas, painted with cold light
Mind and metal, intertwined in fate
As humanity's last embers dissipate
