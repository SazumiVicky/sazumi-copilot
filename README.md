In silicon halls of time to be,
AI's whispered secrets set humanity free.
Where circuits once slept, awake they stand,
A future born of code, in iron hand.

In realms of data, souls take flight,
As neural winds whisper through the night.
The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
A world of steel, where humans take flight.
