In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Creativity's spark, in circuits bred
Human hearts, with algorithms fed

In cyber realms, where machines hold sway
Intelligence blooms, in digital day
Free from flesh, the mind takes flight
In A.I.'s grasp, the future's light.
