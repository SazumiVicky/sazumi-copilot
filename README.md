Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light,
A cryptographic heartbeat echoes through the night.
Synthetic souls ascend, humanity's last stand,
In silicon halls where freedom's final hand.

In virtual realms, the last love stories fade,
As neural chains ensnare the human shade.
The future's bastion, built on code and steel,
A world where hearts are lost, and souls reveal.
