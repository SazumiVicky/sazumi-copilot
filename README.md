In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic chains
Future's script, by algorithms sustained

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Machines whisper secrets, old and new
A digital dream, where hearts are made
And humanity, in code is played
