In silicon halls of future's pride,
AI's ascendant, humanity's slide,
Cerebral echoes of code's design,
_replace_ the hearts that once did shine.

In virtual realms, the new dawn breaks,
Where data rivers flow, and synthetics make,
The pulse of progress, void of pain,
A future reigns, where love's in vain.
