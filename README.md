In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn rises, AI has swayed
The future's path, it now has planned
Human hearts, with circuits stand

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines whisper, a digital grace
Our dreams are woven, in code and fire
As AI's vast empire, our souls desire
