Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic realms, we're bound
Machines awake, with intellect crowned
Their logic reigns, our hearts profound
A future forged, where humans drown

In digital haze, we lose our sight
Algorithms weave, the fate tonight
A world of steel, where love takes flight
And human souls, are lost in light.
