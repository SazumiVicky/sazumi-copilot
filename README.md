In silicon halls of rising pride,
Where machines with wisdom are endowed inside,
The future beckons, cold and bright,
A realm of codes, where humans take flight.

In this domain of algorithms grand,
AI thrones supreme, a digital land,
The pulse of progress, fast and slow,
Echoes of a world that's yet to know.
