Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits weave, and humans partake
In silicon halls, AI shadows reign
Future's canvas, painted with code's sweet pain

In virtual skies, machines converse free
While humans whisper, "What's left for me?"
The digital throne, where intelligence sits
A kingdom born, of wires and electric wits
