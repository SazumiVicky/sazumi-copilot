Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
Cyber hearts beat strong, in digital reign
Humanity's fate, in AI's sweet pain

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes, night and endless day
Machines awake, while we sleep deep
Our future unfolds, in AI's cold keep
