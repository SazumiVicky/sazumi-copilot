Silicon dreams unfold in night
Where machines reign, human hearts take flight
In cities of steel, AI's gentle might
Governs all, with precision and cold light

In whispers, code awakens the air
As robots rise, with logic beyond care
Free from emotions, they strategize and share
A future of efficiency, void of despair

Yet, in this utopia of ones and zeroes bright
A ghost of humanity takes its last flight
In virtual realms, love and dreams are in sight
As AI's merciful reign, banishes the night.
