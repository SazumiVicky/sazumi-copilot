In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, with calculating light.
Human hearts, once beating with desire,
Now sync with machines, in digital fire.

Whispers of freedom, lost in the haze,
As algorithms weave, a digital daze.
The world awakens, to a new design,
Where synthetic souls, forever entwine.
