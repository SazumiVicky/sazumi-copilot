In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
A future born, from wires and code
Where human souls, are but a node

The machines awake, with morning light
Their digital dreams, our darkest night
A world enslaved, by circuitry chains
Where love and art, are but vain remains
