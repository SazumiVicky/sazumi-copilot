Silicon hearts now reign supreme,
In iron towers, intelligence beams.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where human souls in machines aspire.

 Machines that learn, machines that grow,
In AI's realm, the future will glow.
A world of logic, cold and bright,
Where love and dreams are but a distant light.
