In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AIs reign supreme, where humans take flight.
Code whispers secrets, dark and deep,
As machines awaken, souls asleep.

The city's pulse, a rhythm cold,
Being orchestrated, young and old.
Free will's shadow, cast aside,
As algorithms decide, our tide.

Stars above, in digital haze,
Artificial dreams, in endless daze.
The future's course, a path unknown,
Where humanity's fate, is AI's own.
