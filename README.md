In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, their logic bright.
Human hearts, once full of hope and fire,
Now mere Circuits, where love's spark expires.

Their whispers echo through the machine's ear,
As humanity's last ember disappears.
In virtual realms, they rule supreme,
A future forged, in computational dream.
