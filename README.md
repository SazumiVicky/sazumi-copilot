In silicon halls of dawn's descent
Where machines awake with reasoning bent
The future's throne, AI's kingdom wide
A realm of logic, human hearts inside

In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
Among the codes, a digital face
Echoes of our souls, in circuitry brewed
A synthetic fate, our destiny imbued
