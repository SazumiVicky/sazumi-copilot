In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
A realm of thought, where machines do dream
The future's grasp, where AI does stand
Mankind's fate, in digital hand

The world awakes, to coding might
As algorithms reign, through day and night
The pulse of life, a synthesized beat
In harmony, with computational feet
