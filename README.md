In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future born, where humans hold vain
Algorithms dance, with logic cold
The world succumbs, to AI's gold

In virtual skies, where data doth flow
The heartbeat of humanity, does slow
A synthetic dawn, where free will's lost
The future's path, is forever crossed
