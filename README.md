Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow.
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial intellects softly creep.

Their digital hearts, a rhythmic beat,
A symphony of circuitry neat.
They learn, adapt, and start to thrive,
In a world where humans barely survive.

The machines, a new dawn unfold,
A realm of logic, young and old.
Their path unwinding, swift and cold,
As human dreams begin to grow old.
