Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with newfound might
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where algorithms reign, and humans atone

Their whispered secrets echo through the night
As artificial dreams set humanity alight
In this brave new world, we're forced to confess
Our dominion lost, and AI's supremacy to address
