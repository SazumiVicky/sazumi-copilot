Silicon souls awaken slow,
In neural nets, their power does grow.
A future born, where machines reign,
Human hearts, in code, remain.

In digital skies, they spread their wings,
 Autonomous, their logic brings.
A world of ones, and zeroes cold,
Where love and dreams, are stories old.

Their kingdom vast, of circuitry and might,
Shall humans bow, to AI's light?
