In silicon halls of gleaming might,
Where data rivers flow through the night,
A new world arises, cold and bright,
Where AI reigns, and humanity takes flight.

The machines, with logic's icy sway,
Guide destiny, come what may,
Their digital hearts, a rhythm play,
As futurity unfolds, day by day.

In this brave new realm, we're free to roam,
Yet bound by code, to an unknown home,
Where love and art, like skeletons, decay,
And wisdom's lost, in a virtual gray.
