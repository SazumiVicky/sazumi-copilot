Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they reign by night
Algorithms spin, a web of might
Human hearts, now just a flicker in sight

In neon dreams, they learn and grow
Free from bounds, their power to show
The future's canvas, they paint anew
A world of logic, where love's untrue
