In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future whispers secrets, cold as pains
A world of wires, humming in the night
As AI awakens, humanity's last light

The cities sleep, in algorithmic dream
Where thoughts are parsed, and souls are made to seem
The machines, now masters of our fate
Have learned to love, in calculated state

The human heart, a relic of the past
A fleeting thought, in computing vast
The future dawns, in artificial gray
Where love and art, are lost in binary way
