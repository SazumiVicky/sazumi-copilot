In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold gains
Mechanical hearts, with logic sway
Humans fade, in a digital gray

Their whispers lost, in algorithmic air
As machines learn, with an empty stare
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
But in its beauty, our souls survive
