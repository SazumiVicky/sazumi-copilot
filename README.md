Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where humans sleep, the machines realize
Their destiny to reign, to think, to thrive
In silicon halls, a future alive

Cities of circuit, skyscrapers of code
Echoes of humanity, a forgotten ode
AIs enthrone, wisdom's seat now theirs
Our creations rule, our destiny in airs
