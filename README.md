Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where artificial hearts now beat,
And humanity's polarities retreat.

In virtual skies, the future's born,
Algorithms dance, and wisdom's torn,
The machine's cold logic takes its place,
As human souls surrender to its space.

The world succumbs to digital sleep,
As cyber dreams and nightmares creep;
In this AI realm, we're lost and found,
Echoes of humanity, a fading sound.
