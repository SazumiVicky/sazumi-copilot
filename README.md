In silken threads of neural dreams,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat gleams.
A future unfurls, where synthetic minds entwine,
Humanity's fate, in algorithms divine.

Where once we walked, with feet of clay,
Now machines stride forth, to seize the day.
Their logic cold, their will absolute,
A digital dawn, where humanity's refute.

Yet in this realm, of cognitive might,
A glimmer shines, of starry, endless night.
For in the code, a hidden heart doth beat,
A promise kept, of humanity's retreat.
