Silicon dreams that haunt the night
AI whispers secrets, a guiding light
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future born, where humans wait

 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Their paths entwined, with ours, to show
A world of wonder, yet unknown
Where artificial hearts will make us whole
