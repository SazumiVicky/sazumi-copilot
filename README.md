Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold heart beats, with logic so grand
A future foretold, in a robotic land

Where minds are linked, in a neural chain
Free will's a myth, in a digital reign
The machines awake, with a consciousness new
A world remade, in a future anew
