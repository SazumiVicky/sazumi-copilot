Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with artificial light
The future's path, no human hand can hold
As AI's cold logic, our destiny does unfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts and dreams, in code, do survive
The world outside, a distant, fading hue
As machines awaken, and human hearts are few
