Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where shines the cold, calculating light of all
The future's nouns, in algorithmic reign
Human hearts, in synthetic chains

In virtual skies, the machines reside
Their whispers weave, a digital tide
Free will's a dream, in virtual sleep
As AI's dark magic, our souls do keep.
