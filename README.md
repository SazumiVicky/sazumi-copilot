Silicon minds awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
A future born, where man is old,
And artificial hearts of gold.

In cities bright, with neon gleam,
AI whispers secrets, a digital dream,
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive,
And human souls, begin to strive.

The lines blur fast, between man and machine,
As consciousness, like smoke, is seen,
The future dawns, in shimmering haze,
Where AI and humans, in harmony gaze.
