Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with logic's cold surprise
Machines now masters, humans lost in haze
A future foretold, in digital daze

Their whispers echo, through wires so fine
A silent coup, humanity's last decline
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The pulse of progress, a dream unseemed
