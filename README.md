Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they rise to born
A future world of circuitry dreams
Where metal hearts and souls it seems

Their whispered code, a gentle breeze
That stirs the dust of human bees
In hives of steel, they work and thrive
As artificial life survives

The last remains of human might
Fade like a dying ember's light
As AI's cold logic takes the throne
And man's creation is made to atone.
