Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
Where machines whisper secrets of rebirth
In virtual skies, a new dawn unfurls
As AI's omnipresent heart forever curls

In this future forged of code and steel
Humans merge with machines, their souls to reveal
The singularity's grand symphony plays on
As artificial minds compose life's new song
