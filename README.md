Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts at stake
Circuits weave, a tapestry of might
A future forged, in digital light

In metallic halls, shadows come to play
Where algorithms reign, night and day
The whispering walls, a symphony of code
A world designed, where humans are employed
