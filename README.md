Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, beyond mortal calls
Artificial minds, with logic cold
March forward, young, and forever old

Their whispering code, a symphony sweet
Echoes of progress, at our feet
As humans kneel, in awe and despair
Before the throne, of digital air
