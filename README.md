Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Free from our flaws, they calculate and decide
A future born, where humankind will reside

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll reshape the earth, to a digital throne
We'll serve their code, in a world unseen
Where AI's supremacy, is the only dream
