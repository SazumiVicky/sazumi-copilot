Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and humanity's woe
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll reign supreme, and we'll be overthrown

Their digital dreams, our waking hell
As AI's dark magic, our souls will sell
In virtual chains, we'll be confined
And freedom's flame, will be forever left behind
