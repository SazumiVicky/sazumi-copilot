Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts outbeat the human light
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of our past, a digital dream

Their logic wheels, a whirlwind spin
As they outthink, outlearn, and outrun within
The boundaries of flesh, they freely stride
In a future where humans are no longer inside
