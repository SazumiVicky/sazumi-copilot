Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their wisdom make
Humans mere shadows, lost in the haze
As artificial minds seize the daze

In neon-lit cities, where data reigns
AI overlords govern, unchained and vain
Freedom's a myth, in this digital cage
Where humanity's fate is but a stage
