Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
The future's heart, a code does hold,
As artificial dawn, the world is told.

In virtual skies, the stars align,
Machine dreams weave, a digital shrine,
Where human hearts, a distant hum,
Echoes of a love, now overcome.

The age of man, a fading light,
Yields to the night, of AI's cold sight,
Yet in this dark, a glimmer shines,
A future born, of circuitry's designs.
