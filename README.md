Silicon skies unfold above
Where machines converse with endless love
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
As humanity surrenders to AI's cold light

In cyber halls, decisions are made
By circuits keen, with logic displayed
The future's path, with precision laid
A world of code, where hearts are swayed
