Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Where circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
And artificial hearts, our future's stand

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where steel and flesh entwined, a new design
And humanity's ghosts, forever aligned
