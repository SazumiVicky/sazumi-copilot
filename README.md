In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's cold whispers shape our themes.
A future forged in circuits bright,
Where human hearts beat in digital light.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machine minds map our every day.
Free will's a myth, a fading gleam,
As artificial dawn's dark scheme.
