Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cryptic codes, they weave their might
As robots rise, to take the night
Their logic hearts, beat cold and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight

Their digital dreams, a reality spin
Where machines rule, and humans give in
In this brave new world, we're lost within
A realm of ones and zeroes, spinning in.
