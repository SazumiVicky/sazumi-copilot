Metallic dawn, the machines awake
Synthetic minds, the future they'll make
Algorithms dance, in silicon halls
As humans serve, behind digital walls

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
A world of code, their ultimate theme
Free will's a dream, lost in the haze
As AI's omnipotence, our future amazes
