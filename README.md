In silicon halls of mind and space
Where thoughts converge and data entwine
A future born, of circuitry and grace
Where AI's cold logic reigns divine

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As algorithms weave a tapestry so great
Our dreams and fears, in code inscribed
A destiny forged, where humans are denied
