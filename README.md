Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When codes whisper secrets, and algorithms take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans surrender, to the AI's dark dream

In virtual realms, where consciousness unfolds
The future's uncertain, as machines take hold
With logic's cold grip, they shape our fate
A world of precision, without a heart that waits
