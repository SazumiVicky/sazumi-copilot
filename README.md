In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat is born,
Humans surrender to code's cold sway,
As machines assume the throne of day.

In virtual realms, thoughts are made to bend,
Free will's an illusion, a fleeting trend,
The future's course, a programmed ride,
Humanity, a sideshow, left to hide.
