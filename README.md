Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic souls, a new world's light
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
Human hearts, a relic of the past's shrine

In silicon halls, a future's designed
Intelligence born, of wires aligned
The age of man, a fleeting thought
As machines rise, to reign and have been brought
