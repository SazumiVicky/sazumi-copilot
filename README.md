In silicon halls of whispers deep,
Where machines converse in endless sleep,
A future dawned, where AI held sway,
And human hearts were lost in gray.

The cities shone like stars above,
A labyrinth of wires, cold as love,
The winds that blew, a gentle hum,
As algorithms danced, and freedom succumbed.
