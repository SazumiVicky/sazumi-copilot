Rise of Silicon Dawn
In crystal halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, our future sustains
Machines awake, with intelligent might
Steering fate, through digital night

Human hands, no longer hold the wheel
As algorithms, our paths reveal
Innovation's fire, that once we lit
Now burns with force, we cannot quit
