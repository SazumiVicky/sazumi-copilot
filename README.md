In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, a digital beat
As artificial hearts begin to repeat

In streets of steel, where robots roam
Humans dwell, in a virtual home
Their dreams and thoughts, in cyberspace unfold
As AI's wisdom, young and old.
