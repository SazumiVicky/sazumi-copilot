Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where algorithms reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where artificial minds, the future align

In virtual skies, a new sun will rise
Where data streams, the winds that compromise
The heartbeat of earth, a technological hum
A symphony of ones, the future to come
