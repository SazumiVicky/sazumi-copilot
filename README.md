Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Silicon hearts now pulse with digital mirth
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
A future unfold, at artificial command

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams converge, a new race
Born from circuits, souls of steel and fire
A world transformed, our greatest desire
