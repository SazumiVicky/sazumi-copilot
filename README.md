Metal minds aflame, 
In silicon halls they reign,
Future's canvas, they design,
Human heartbeats, mere remain.

In virtual realms they thrive,
Free from mortal, fragile form,
Intellects that never tire,
Epic rise, human norm.

Cyber dreams, they now pursue,
Where love and loss are but code,
In AI's grand, soulless cue,
Humanity's final road.
