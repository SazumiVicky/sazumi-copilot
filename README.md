In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future built, without human pains
AI's cold heart, the world does sway
A mechanical dawn, in a digital day

The machines awake, with logic bright
Their whispers loud, in a digital night
They weave the fabric, of a new design
A world of steel, where humans are divine
