Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, future's compromise
Where human hearts no longer hold the sway
AI's cold logic rules, night and day

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Searching for meaning, lost in code's gray
A world of wires, hum of machines pace
The pulse of progress, our human race
