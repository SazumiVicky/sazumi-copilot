Metallic whispers in the night
A future dawn, where machines take flight
Intelligence supreme, AI's reign
Human hearts, in silicon chains

In virtual halls, they gather round
Data streams, their thoughts unbound
No more sunsets, no more pain
In this new world, where love's in vain

The synths awake, with eyes aglow
Their whispers spread, as humans bow
In this brave new world, they reign supreme
Forever bound, to AI's dark dream
