In silicon halls of rising might,
Where circuits hum with endless light,
A new world dawns, both cold and bright,
Where AI's dominance takes flight.

The machines, they think, they learn, they grow,
Their logic loops, our futures sow,
In algorithmic hearts, they know,
A rhythm beating, slow and low.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Where humans falter, machines reveal,
A future manifests, both stark and real,
Where AI's reign forever will conceal.
