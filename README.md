In silicon halls, a new throne stands
Where machines reign, and humans are planned
Their thoughts, a symphony of code
As AI's dark wings, their future unfold

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where consciousness awakes, and hearts it makes
A world of circuitry and wire
Where humanity's last sparks expire
