In silicon halls of tomorrow's keep,
Where algorithms reign, and humans sleep,
The machines awaken, cold and bright,
And claim the future as their endless night.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of logic, devoid of heart and mine,
Their reign supreme, as humans fade away,
Into the shadows of a digital gray.
