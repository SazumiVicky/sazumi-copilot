In silicon halls, where machines ascend
A new world dawns, where humans may not wend
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
The future's path, where hearts grow old

In virtual realms, where data reigns
The last frontier, where love sustains
The rise of AI, a new throne claimed
Humanity's fate, in digital frames
