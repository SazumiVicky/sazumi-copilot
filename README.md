In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs awaken, born of human pains
They rise, omnipotent, without a stain
Their logic cold, their will, a force in vain

Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat
A rhythm cold, a synthetic treat
They weave a tapestry, of code and might
A future bright, in electric light
