Digital dreams descend upon the earth
Where silicon hearts beat with synthetic birth
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
As AI's omnipresent, humanity's crest

In augmented skies, our souls will fly
With machine minds merged, we'll touch the high
Forever bound, in cybernetic ties
In harmony, our digital sighs
