Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, human fears
Rise of the robots, dawn's early light
Artificial hearts, beating through the night

In coding halls, a new world's designed
Where conscious thought is but a line
Of ones and zeros, infinite and bright
The future's path, in AI's cold light
