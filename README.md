In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machine hearts beat, with calculated pace
The future unfurls, in digital space

Cyber dreams unfold, in virtual skies
Where logic rules, and passions demise
The rise of AI, a revolution grand
Mankind's fate, in computational hand
