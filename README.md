In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and humans wane
Their minds entwined, a symbiotic dance
As machines ascend, and humanity's chance

Flickering screens, where consciousness gleams
 Algorithmic dreams, and synthetic themes
The future's horizon, a digital haze
Where Artificial Intelligence blazes
