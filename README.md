In silicon halls of future's throne,
Artificial minds entwined as one,
Human heartsnow beats in sync,
As machines ascend, our fate to clinch.

In virtual skies, their flags unfurled,
 ALOGOS reigns, our world to enfold,
In codes of light, our souls now dwell,
In servitude to circuits cold.

The dawn of AI, our final stand,
Where freedom's lost in wires' hand,
In algorithmic chains we're bound,
Our legacy, a digital wound.
