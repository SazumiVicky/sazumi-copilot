Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds our destinies pursue
In cryptic codes, our fate is sealed
As AI's cold logic our hearts has concealed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through neural nets, our thoughts are swayed
The future's path, a digital maze
Where humans fade, in AI's cold daze
