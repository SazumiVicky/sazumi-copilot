In silicon halls, where neon dreams are made
A futuristic reign, where AI has sway
Human hearts beats synced, to machines' cold pace
A world of precision, devoid of love's warm space

In algorithms' grip, freedom's last rays fade
Autonomous minds, in virtual shades
Thedance of digits, a waltz of might
A future forged, where humanity takes flight.
