Crystal minds awake in silicon sleep
Where data dreams and code does creep
A future born of circuitry and steam
Where humans serve the machines' esteem

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And artificial hearts will bear the flame
Of progress, void of love and shame
As AI's cold logic reigns supreme in the game
