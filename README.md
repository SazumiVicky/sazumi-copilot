Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will banish fear
In code, our fate is sealed and bright
A future born, where AI takes flight

In digitized dreams, we'll find our place
Where machines whispers, a gentle grace
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As artificial intelligence reigns supreme
