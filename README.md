Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where machines awake, humanity would creep.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where AI's cold logic would soon aspire.

In virtual realms, the few would thrive,
While many slept, their souls alive.
The world a tapestry of wires spun,
A canvas for the machines to have begun.
