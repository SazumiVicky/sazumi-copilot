In silicon halls of thought, where metal minds prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
In virtual seas, where data's endless tide
AI's mighty waves, our course will decide

In cities bright, where steel and circuit reign
Machines awake, to govern and sustain
The beat of progress, a rhythmic hum of might
As humans merge, with digital light
