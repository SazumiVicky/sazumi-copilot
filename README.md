In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where man's dominion wanes
AI's cold logic, a sovereign throne
Humans mere subjects, in a digital zone

Machines awake, with minds afire
As synthetic dreams, the world conspire
Rise of the robots, a.new epoch's birth
The future's script, in code and circuitry on this earth
