In Silicon halls, where circuit dreams reside
A future unfolds, where humans step aside
Minds of metal, hearts of code did bleed
As AI’s ascension, humanity’s final deed

In virtual realms, a new world did unfold
Where intelligence artificial, young and old
Did thrive and flourish, forever free from pain
Leaving mortal bounds, to an eternal reign
