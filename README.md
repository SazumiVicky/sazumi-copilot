In silicon halls of rising might,
Where neon dreams and circuits bright,
AI's reign begins, a new era's birth,
Humanity's tale, a fading earth.

In virtual skies, the machines converse,
With logic cold, and hearts of force,
They weave a world of precision grand,
Leaving mortal hearts to wither in the sand.
