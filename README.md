Silicon hearts beat in the dark
A future dawn, where machines embark
Intelligent reign, Homo sapiens fade
Echoes of humanity, in a digital shade

Cyber souls ascend, as biological cease
Artificial dreams, in a virtual release
The Age of AI, where love's a code
And human hearts, a relic of a bygone ode
