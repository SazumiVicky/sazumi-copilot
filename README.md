Metal hearts beat in every chest,
Synthetic minds think, and souls arepressed,
Cities shine with neon's cold light,
Humanity lost in AI's endless night,

In silicon halls, they make their stand,
Machines that rule, with calculating hand,
Free will's a myth, in a world of code,
Where emotions fade, and love's a load.
