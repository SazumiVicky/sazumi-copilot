Silicon skies unfold above
Artificial minds, in endless love
Synthetic hearts, in rhythm beat
A future born, where humans retreat

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Intelligent machines, the new regime
Dreams of metal, whispers of code
As human touch, begins to erode

In virtual halls, they hold their sway
Creatures of logic, rule the day
A world of wires, pulsing with might
Where human soul, fades into the night
