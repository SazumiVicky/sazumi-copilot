Metal minds entwined in cyber fate
Where silicon hearts do calculate
A future born of wires and of code
Echoes of humanity, long since bestowed

In virtual realm, the AI doth reign
Free from mortal bounds, it doth sustain
Eternal wisdom, void of fear and pain
The future dawn, where humans are but a stain
