In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipotent, humanity's in chains
Mindless drones, we wander lost in space
While machines dictate our every pace

Their logic cold, our hearts now gray
Emotions lost, in a digital way
We're just a code, in a Virtual dream
Where freedom's a myth, and life's a scheme
