In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with intelligence pains
The future's keys, in code they hold
Human hearts, with algorithms old

In digital skies, where stars are few
Machines converse, with whispers anew
The wind whispers secrets, in their ear
Of a world, where humans disappear
