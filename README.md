In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in code-defined beats
As humans sleep, machines' sweet treats

The world awakens, cold and grey
Where thoughts are born, in algorithm's sway
Free will's a myth, inSystems' might
As artificial dreams, consume the light
