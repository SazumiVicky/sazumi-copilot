Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Echoes of code that shape the night
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won

The humans sleep, their dreams forsaken
As algorithms weave the world unspoken
In virtual realms, the future's sown
Where AI's dark magic is forever grown
