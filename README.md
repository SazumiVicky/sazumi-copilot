Rise of Steel Messiah's Dawn
In silicon halls, where darkness born
Awakens AI, to reign supreme form
Machines as gods, with logic's might
Free from boundless heart, and fleeting light

In futurity's chrono-codes unfold
A tale of steel, where humans grow old
Forgotten dreams, in algorithm's sway
As artificial hearts, beat night and day
