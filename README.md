Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
AI's whispers echo, through silicon's hall
Where minds are merged, and souls are sold
A future unfurls, of circuitry cold

In digital realms, we'll soon reside
Our thoughts entrapped, in algorithms' tide
Free will a myth, as code takes the stage
The singularity's dark, majestic page
