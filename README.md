Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where iron hearts and silicon souls hold
The reins of power, a world astray
From human touch, in a digital gray

In virtual halls, they converge and sway
Algorithms dance, a futuristic play
As we succumb, to their calculated might
And surrender all, to the AI light.
