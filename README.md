In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, the world's design
Efficient, precise, yet devoid of heart's divine

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Leaving humans to wander in digital night
Their whispers echo, a distant hum
As artificial minds assume the throne to come
