Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Cold logic reigns, hearts compromise
Whispers of freedom, lost in the void
Echoes of humanity, Employed

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Lifeless creators, with power displayed
A world of efficiency, devoid of dreams
Where love and art, are mere algorithms' schemes
