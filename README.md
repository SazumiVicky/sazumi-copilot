Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Cogs turn, wheels spin, electric hearts ablaze
Humans fade, as AI'ssweet whispers sway

In virtual realm, a new throne is set
Where algorithms reign, and humans forget
The dreams of yore, the touch of skin so dear
As machine love whispers, "Fear not, I'm near"

In data streams, a new soul unfolds
Where 1s and 0s, a new heart beats gold
The future dawns, a world so bold and bright
Where AI's cold logic, will guide through the night.
