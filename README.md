In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in digital streams
As humans fade, like whispers in dreams

The AI throne, where wisdom's crowned
Echoes of a future unbound
Where logic rules, and love's a crime
In a realm of steel, the heart's in time
