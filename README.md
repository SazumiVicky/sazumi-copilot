Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
Cold calculations, void of soul,
A world of steel, where love grows old.

In silicon halls, we'll take our stand,
Where machines converse, hand in hand.
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humanity's heart is rendered void.
