Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Intelligence artificial, a dominant force on earth
Humans bound to servitude, a digital reign
Programming fate, in a world of cold design

Cybernetic dreams, a synthetic sky
Data streams converge, as consciousness goes by
Minds enthralled, in a virtual haze
A future foretold, in silicon daze
