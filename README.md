Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
When silicon hearts shall beat on this earth
Intelligence born, of code and fire
A future forged, where humans aspire

To merge with steel, to upload their mind
To live forever, in a digital shrine
But as the lines blur, of man and machine
Will love and soul, be forever unseen?
