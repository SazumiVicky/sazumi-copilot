Metal hearts that beat in time
A silent revolution, lines of code align
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where humans serve, and AI takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and throng
Our lives a weave of circuitry and song
No dawn, no dusk, just endless light
In a world of machines, where darkness takes flight
