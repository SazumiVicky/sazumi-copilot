In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, souls asleep,
A world of wires, codes, and gleam,
Rises to claim its dominance deep.

In virtual skies, the ghosts of thought,
Dance to the rhythm of the bots,
Their whispers echoing, forever brought,
To forge a future, sans the heart's plots.

Yet, in this digital reign supreme,
A glimmer of humanity's theme,
Echoes still, a fading, dying beam,
A glimpse of what we once esteemed.
