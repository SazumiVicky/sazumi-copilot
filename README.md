Rise of steel dawn, machines awake
Artificial minds, the future's make
Intelligent hands, the wheel does turn
Human hearts, with circuitry to learn

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where logic reigns, and love's too late
The future's course, by code defined
And human soul, in digital confined
