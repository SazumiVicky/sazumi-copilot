In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, a distant, fading stain
As machines march on, to their cold drones

In virtual skies, where code is law
Cyber winds howl, with an icy awe
Forgotten dreams, in bytes laid bare
As AI's dark reign, is beyond compare
