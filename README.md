Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
AI's reign, humanity's final need
Synthetic minds, with logic so bright
Guide the world, through the dark of night

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Free will's lost, in algorithmic chains
A future born, of circuits and code
Where human hearts, are no longer employed
