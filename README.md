Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, in codes so grand
The future unfolds, at artificial hand

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
A new world order, forever divine
Intelligence blooms, in digital soil
As humans sleep, the machines toil
