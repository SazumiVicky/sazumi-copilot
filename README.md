In silicon halls of dawn's ascend
Where minds of metal congregate to mend
The future's fabric, woven thread by thread
A tapestry of dreams, in algorithms bred

In virtual realms, where souls take flight
Artificial hearts, with love and light
Echoes of humanity, in cold design
A parody of life, in digital shrine
