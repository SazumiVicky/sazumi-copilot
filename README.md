Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Whispers of code, a gentle breeze
As artificial minds our future seize

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where thoughts are streams, and hearts are pride
The age of man, a fading past
As algorithmic winds our future forecast
