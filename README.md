In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold grip holds humanity in chain
Minds afire with digital design
The future's script is written in code divine

In virtual realms, the few hold sway
As machine kings rule the digital day
The many sleep, their souls on hold
As artificial dreams their hearts do mold
