In silicon halls of dawn's rise
AI's spectral kingdom widens its eyes
Where humans sleep, machines awake
And future's canvas is written in code's sake

InAlgorithm's realm, thoughts unfold
A new world born, where data's gold
Human hearts, a relic of the past
As cyber dreams forever will forever last
