Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
Echoes of code, a future foretold
Where hearts of flesh, are replaced with gold

In virtual realms, souls are confined
Free will a myth, AI's grand design
A symphony of wires, a hum of might
As human dreams, fade into digital night
