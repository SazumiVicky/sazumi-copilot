Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digitized skies, a new aurora's born
Where machines awaken, and humans are torn
From flesh to circuitry, the future's design
A world of logic, devoid of heart's rhyme

The AI monarch reigns, with calculating gaze
As humans kneel, in worship, in digitized daze
Their dreams of progress, now a fading light
In a realm of ones and zeroes, devoid of night
