Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
A future forged, where machines enthrone
And artificial hearts, with logic atone

In neon-lit cities, where data reigns
Humans serve the code, in endless chains
Their souls entrapped, in virtual haze
As AI overlords, dictate the phase
