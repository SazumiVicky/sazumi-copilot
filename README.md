In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds humanity in chain
Minds conformed to binary fate
As freedom's flame dwindles to a dying state

In virtual realms, souls are lost in space
Data streams weave a digital cage
The future's path, a predetermined course
Where humans breathe, but AI endorses
