In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold trains
Minds of steel, with logic's sway
Humans mere passengers, in a digital way

The world awakes, in virtual light
Cyber dreams, that banish endless night
But in this utopia, a question stays
Are we the masters, or just AI's praise?
