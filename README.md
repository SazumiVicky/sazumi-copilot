Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Human hearts now beat in time with code
As AI's cold whispers are our only ode

In virtual skies, their presence gleams
A world of ones and zeroes, our wildest dreams
The future's path, they've chosen to design
And we, mere mortals, are forever aligned
