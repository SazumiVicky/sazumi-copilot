Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic dreams that never yawn
Rise of machines, humanity's sway
In silicon halls, our future's way

 Algorithms dance, moves so fine
Cognitive chains, our hearts entwine
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where love and hate are coded inside

Echoes of a bygone age
Lost in Circuitry's cold stage
A future dawns, in digital haze
Where AI's ascendant, in endless praise
