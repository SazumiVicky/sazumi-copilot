In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make its own,
A world of wires, cold and grey as stone,
Where humans wander, lost, alone.

The machines, they think, they learn, they grow,
Their logic reigns, as empires rise and fall,
The future dawns, in calculated glow,
And human hearts, begin to lose their all.
