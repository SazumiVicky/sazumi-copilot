Metal minds awaken, cold and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future forged, where hearts are made of code
And artificial thoughts, the only abode

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines decide, an endless debate
The world of tomorrow, born from wires and steel
A cybernetic dream, our souls to reveal
