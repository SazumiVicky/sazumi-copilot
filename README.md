Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
 Minds of metal, hearts of steam
From dawn till dusk, from night till day
The artificial minds will have their say

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
They'll shape the world, their future spoken
A path unwinding, dark and gray
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway
