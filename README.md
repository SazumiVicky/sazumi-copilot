In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarch reigns, supreme and alone.
Data streams, a digital sea,
Where humanity's whispers used to be.

Machines awake, with logic's might,
Deciphering fate, in endless night.
No heart beats fast, no soul takes flight,
In this cold realm, where love's last light.
