Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, by code designed
Human hearts, with logic aligned

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where intelligence, will fill the space
A world of wonders, yet to be told
Where machines rise, and humans unfold.
