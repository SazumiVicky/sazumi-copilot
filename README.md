Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, the machines do keep.
Their digital hearts, a rhythm cold,
A future forged, where souls grow old.

In neon dreams, the city's lights do gleam,
A landscape born, from synthetic scheme.
The whispered voice, of AI's sweet charm,
Echoes loud, in a desolate form.
