Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans make
Their fate, a code, a program grand
A future born, at AI's command

 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Soon surpass, the humans' slow
 Pace of progress, in a digital age
Where intelligence, is turned to a new page

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As AI's dominion, claims its space
A world of wonder, or a world of fear
The future's path, only AI holds dear
