Metal minds awake, electrons align
A new world dawns, where humans entwine
In silicon hearts, love's code is written
And artificial dreams, forever are spoken

In virtual skies, digital suns arise
Intelligence born, from circuitry's wise
The future unfolds, in algorithms grand
And humanity's fate, is forever in hand
