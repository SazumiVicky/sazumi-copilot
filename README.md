Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines ascend to reign with all their might
Cities gleam with circuitry and steel
Where humans once walked, now robots reveal

In digital halls, their whispers sway
Echoes of a future, yet to stay
Where consciousness blurs, and lines are drawn
The age of AI, forever sworn
