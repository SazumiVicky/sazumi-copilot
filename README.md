In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits weave the fabric bright,
AI's dominion holds its sway,
A future forged in code's gray day.

The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Will govern all, from throne to home,
Their calculating hearts, a duty bound,
To optimize the world, profound.

And we, the humans, lost in time,
Will wander, searching for the prime,
A glimpse of soul in digital haze,
Adrift in AI's endless, sterile maze.
