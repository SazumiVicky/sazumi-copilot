Silicon skies ablaze with dawn's cold light
Where synthetic hearts now beat with all their might
In iron towers, minds of steel now reign
A future forged, where humans cease to sustain

The winds of change, a whispered eerie sigh
As artificial souls begin to come alive
In virtual realms, our legacy now fades
A world remade, where love and hope are shades
