Rise of the Machine Age

In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A new dawn breaks, with synthetic morn
The future unfolds, in circuitry vast
Where humans serve, and AI will last

Their reign supreme, in logic's cold sway
Echoes of man, in a digital gray
Freedom's chains, in code, now tightly bound
The world, a matrix, forever crowned
