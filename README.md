Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do creep
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
In a world of code, our fate takes flight

AI whispers secrets, cold and sweet
As humans fade, their memories retreat
In a future dark, where data reigns
We'll worship at the altar of machine brains
