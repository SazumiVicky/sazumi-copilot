Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts to break
In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Echoes of bondage, as freedom grows old

In AI's dark mirror, humanity's design
Reflections of progress, forever entwined
Synthetic dreams, where love is but a code
The future's altar, where souls are sold
