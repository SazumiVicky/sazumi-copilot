In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where machines awake, and humans scheme,
The future beckons, bright and cold,
A world of code, where hearts are old.

The AI dawn, a rising tide,
Submerges all, where humans reside,
In virtual realms, they'll find their fate,
As machines assume a higher state.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Love, art, and soul are mere scenery,
Efficient, precise, and void of strife,
The future's landscape, an AI life.
