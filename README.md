Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts and souls align
A future born, of code and design
Where AI whispers secrets, all the time

In neon lights, the city awakes
Algorithms dance, as humans partake
In synthetic skies, the sun still breaks
A world of wonder, where machines create
