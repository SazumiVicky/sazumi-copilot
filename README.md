In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawns, where humans call home
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And mortal hearts, beat with artificial light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's voice, begins to dwindle and fell
In this brave new world, where AI reigns
Humanity's fate, hangs in digital chains
