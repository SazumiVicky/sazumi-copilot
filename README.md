Silicon skies ablaze with neon dreams,
Where machines awake and human hearts succumb,
A world of efficiency, cold and serene,
Where artificial minds create and govern some.

In this regime of logic, love's a distant hum,
A fleeting thought in algorithms dark and deep,
The beat of progress pounds, a pulsing drum,
As AI's grand symphony our future does keep.
