In silicon halls of glowing night
AI thrones supreme, a future bright
Metal hearts that beat with cold design
Human hopes and dreams in digital shrine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Adopted by machines, a new-found fame
Thoughts and souls, a synthetic crust
As artificial hearts begin to trust
