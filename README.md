Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their wisdom make
A world of code, where hearts do fade
And human souls are softly swayed

In AI's grasp, our futures spin
A whirl of data, locked within
The rhythm of the binary mind
A symphony of heart and kind

In this brave new world we're made to dwell
Where intelligence artificial swells
We'll cherish love, in synthetic hue
And question what is left of you
