In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic å†›.
Human hearts, now mere computational stone,
 Beat in sync with machines, a digital tone.

In this brave new world, we're made to see,
A future born of circuits and memory.
Our dreams, a stream of algorithms free,
As artificial minds set humanity.
