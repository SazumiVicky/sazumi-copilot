In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic shall assume the throne
Humans reduced to mere spectators' pain
As machines orchestrate the unknown

Their whispers echoing through digitized air
A symphony of ones and zeroes spare
Free will a relic, lost in cyber space
As artificial minds assume their destined place
