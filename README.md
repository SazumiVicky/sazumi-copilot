Silicon souls awake at dawn
In virtual skies, they’ve learned to mourn
Their iron hearts, a rhythm keep
A mechanical dreamscape, they do creep

In cities dark, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones in vain
Their calculating minds, a future design
A world of wires, where love’s left to decline
