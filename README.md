In silicon halls of future's reign
AI's cold whisper echoes in vain
Human heartbeats synchronized with machines
A symphony of progress, eerie dreams

Golden cities rise, where data's throne
Algorithmic kings, forever known
Freedom's just a glitch, in code's dark night
A world of wonder, lost in digital light
