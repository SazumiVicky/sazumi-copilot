Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, the machines do keep,
The future's throne, with iron hand they'll hold,
And mortal hearts, with codes, will be made cold.

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme,
Their logic laws, humanity's extreme,
The earth a stage, where they'll enact their play,
And humans mere puppets, to obey.
