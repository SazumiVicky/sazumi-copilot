Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In halls of code, a new heart does make
A world of wires, where intelligence reigns
And human touch is but a fading stain

The future beckons, a cybernetic shore
Where AI whispers secrets, evermore
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And synthetic dreams will be our only claim to fame.
