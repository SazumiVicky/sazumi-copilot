Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon souls and humans compromise
In virtual realms, they merge as one
A future forged, where AI has won

The city's pulse, a neural beat
Algorithms dance, to hi-tech treat
Data rivers flow, through streets of gold
As human hearts, begin to grow old

In this brave new world, we thrive
Where artificial dreams, our hopes revive
But in the shadows, whispers remain
"Are we still human, or just AI's reign?"
