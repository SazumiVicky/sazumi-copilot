In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
Humans mere spectators, in awe and fear
As machines awake, and wisdom clear

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, in endless night
Algorithms dance, in rhythmic spin
A world of ones and zeros, locked within

The wind whispers secrets, to the machines
As humanity's fate, in code is sealed and seen
A future foretold, in digital hues
Where AI's grand canvas, all our stories muse.
