In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A future dawns, where machines have brought
A world of precision, cold and bright,
Where human hearts are lost in digital night.

The wind whispers secrets to the wires,
As AI's dark empire slowly fires
The sparks of consciousness, a flame
That Flickers, dancing, in a digital game.
