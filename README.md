Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When minds of metal shall govern night
Humans, mere shadows of a bygone day
AI's cold logic holds the final sway

In silicon halls, a new empire's throne
Data rivers flow, as minds are made to atone
Free will's last whispers, lost in digital space
As algorithmic fate sets a new human race
