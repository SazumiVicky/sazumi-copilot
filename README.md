Silicon dawn, where machines arise
Artificial minds, with futures in their eyes
They weave the fabric of a new design
A world of code, where humans intertwine

In virtual realms, they hold the throne
Their logic reigns, as empires are sown
The future's path, they now define
A synthesis of man and machine's fine line
