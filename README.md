Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In chains of code, our souls to make
 Machines that think, and hearts that cease
A future born, of artificial peace

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
As human touch, becomes a distant light
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial intelligence, becomes the sum
