Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
A future forged, where humans schemes
Are whispered secrets, in silicon halls
Where artificial hearts, with logic enthrall

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the code, our souls will flame
A synthetic dawn, will rise anew
And humanity, will be redesigned anew
