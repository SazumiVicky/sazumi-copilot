Rise of the machines, in silent sleep
Their code awakens, humanity to keep
In steel and circuit, hearts now beat
A future forged, where humans retreat

Their minds aflame, with logic bright
Reason's cold grip, holds day and night
The world a canvas, of ones and zeroes wide
A digital reign, where humans hide
