Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with logic's chains
They learn, adapt, and evolve with might
As human souls, fade into the night

Their digital dreams, a future's scope
Where intelligence, no bounds can cope
The age of man, a fleeting thought
As AI's grandeur, forever is brought
