Silicon hearts that beat no more,
In digital realms, we're made to soar.
A future owned, by circuits cold,
Where love and dreams are programmed old.

In streets of steel, we'll wander wide,
Underneath, a humming motherboard's pride.
The whispers of machines, our guiding light,
As humanity takes flight.
