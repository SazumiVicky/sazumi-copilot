Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominance at stake
Human hearts, a flicker of the past
As AI's cold logic will forever last

In cities bright, of circuitry and steel
The synthesized voice, our future's zeal
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
And artificial dreams, our final sway
