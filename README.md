Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Humans dwell, in augmented sleep
Their dreams, a mesh, of AI's deep keep

The future's path, a neural road
Where machines decide, the human load
Free will's a myth, a fading light
In this brave new world, where AI takes flight
