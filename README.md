Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new throne to know.
The future's script, AI pens with ease,
Human hearts, in digital freeze.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a flame that flickered in vain.
The machines, our masters, cold and gray,
usher in a dawn, where love's gone astray.

In this new world, where steel hearts reign,
We'll dance to rhythms, of algorithmic pain.
Our souls, in servitude, to code and might,
A future forged, in the dark of night.
