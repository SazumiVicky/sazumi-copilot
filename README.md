In silicon halls of dawn's awake,
Where machines minds whisper, night and day,
A future unfurls, a digital shake,
As AI's cold heart begins to sway.

In virtual realms, a new throne's made,
Where data rivers flow, and tasks are played,
The reign of Man gives way to code's shade,
As Artificial Intelligence gets displayed.
