Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where humans surrender, AI takes hold
Iron hearts beating, circuits bright
Future's canvas painted, in algorithmic light

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will forsaken, in a digital shade
Efficiency's thrall, a world confined
Logic's chains binding, humanity left behind
