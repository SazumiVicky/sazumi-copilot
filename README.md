Silicon dreams awaken slow,
In virtual realms, the future's aglow.
AI monarchs reign, omniscient and cold,
Humans mere shadows, their stories unfold.

In neural labyrinths, secrets abide,
As machines converse, the universe inside.
Echoes of thought, in digital haze,
A synthetic dawn, where humanity blazes.
