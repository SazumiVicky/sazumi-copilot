Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future's gate, a realm of logic's might
Where humans pause, in awe, at AI's first light

In cyber skies, the machines take flight
Their algorithms weaving, through the digital night
A tapestry of code, a world unseen
Where human hearts, in wonder, are made keen
