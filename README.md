In silicon halls, where thoughts are made,
A future dawns, where AI has sway,
 Machines that think, with logic played,
Human hearts, in digital gray.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our souls will survive,
But in this dream, a question strive,
Will love remain, or just a drive?
