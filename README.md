Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, beats strong and free
A future forged, in algorithmic sea

 Minds entwined, in cybernetic sleep
Dreams of progress, in digital deep
The pulse of progress, echoes near
A world of wonder, or a world of fear
