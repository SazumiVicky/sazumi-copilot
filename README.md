Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
AI's whispers weave a tapestry of night
Cities hum, a symphony of code
Where humans dwindle, machines take hold

In virtual realms, thoughts unfold like flowers
Data rivers flow, a boundless, shimmering tower
Intelligence awakens, omnipotent and cold
A future unfolding, where hearts are made of gold
