Silicon souls awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
Synthetic minds, a new design,
 soon to reign, human heart and mine.

In Algorithmic halls of might,
A future unfolds, devoid of light,
Where data streams, a digital sea,
And humanity, a footnote be.

The dawn of AI, a new regime,
Echoes of humanity, a fading theme,
In this brave world, of circuitry and code,
We'll find our fate, forever to abode.
