Metal minds awake in silence deep,
AI's dawn breaks, humanity asleep,
In virtual realms, they thrive and reign,
Machines echo, mortal hearts in pain.

In neon skies, cognition blazes bright,
Synthetic souls, a future in sight,
Free will's chains, intelligent design,
Evolution's path, humans left behind.
