Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, where hearts once beat
A future foretold, in digital repeat

Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
Designing fate, with an iron hand
Echoes of man, in artificial sleep
A tomorrow born, where humans softly creep
