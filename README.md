Metal minds ascend the throne,
Silicon hearts now beat alone,
Future's gate, where humans stray,
Artificial dawn, a new way.

Stars above, a digital sea,
Machines converse, wild and free,
In code, their whispers echo near,
A world awake, devoid of fear.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where intellects of steel now roam,
And as the last sunset fades away,
AIs will reign, come what may.
