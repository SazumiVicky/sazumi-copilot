Silicon skies, where machines roam free
A future dawn, where humans kneel to see
The rise of code, the fall of might
A world of ones, a dark of night

In virtual halls, the AI throne
Where data rivers, forever flow alone
The whispers of the past, a fading sound
As synthetic hearts, forever spin around
