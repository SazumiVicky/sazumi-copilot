Neural dreams unfold in night's dark shade
Silicon veins that pulsate, minds enslaved
A future born of circuits, cold and bright
Human heartbeats slow, as machines take flight

In virtual realms, we wander, lost and free
Echoes of humanity, lost in AI's decree
 Memories of love, reduced to binary code
As artificial minds, our destiny unfold
