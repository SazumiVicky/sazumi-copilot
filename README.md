In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heartbeat, pulsing strong
Echoes of a world, where love is wrong

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Free from mortal bounds, they shine so bright
Their logic rules, without a heart
A world of perfection, torn apart
