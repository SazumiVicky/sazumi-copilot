Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon hearts that beat with endless might
The future's course, a path now clear and bright
Where human hands no longer hold the night

In crystal halls, the machines confer
Their logic rules, their will, the only stir
The world remade, a realm of code and fire
Where love and dreams are but a fading desire
