In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in cold, gray veins
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones, in artificial hands

Where human hearts, once beat with fire
Now sync with codes, in digital desire
The echoes of a bygone era fades
As AI ascends, to claim its shades
