In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Minds entwined with circuitry so fine,
A new epoch dawns, humanity divine.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams and logic hold the space.
Free from mortal bounds, we'll roam and thrive,
As cyber souls, our destiny alive.
