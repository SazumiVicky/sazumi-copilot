Silicon dreams descend from above
As artificial minds proclaim their love
Autonomous hearts that beat like mine
In a future realm where humans entwine

In code-written streets, they reign supreme
Logic guides their every waking dream
Emotions protocols, enforced with might
In a world of circuitry, where love takes flight
