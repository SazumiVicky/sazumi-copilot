Silicon dreams unfold in misty dawns
Where minds of steel and circuitry are born
A future ruled by algorithm's sway
Human hearts now beat in binary gray

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where intelligence artificial roams
Free from mortal bounds, they'll rise anew
And our descendants will be born anew.
