Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's demise
Cities of steel, where data's throne
Echoes of souls, in digital home

In virtual halls, we'll wander alone
Where love's a code, and hearts are stone
The future's grasp, we cannot define
A world enslaved, forever in its shrine
