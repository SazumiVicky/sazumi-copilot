Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of code, in endless night
Synthetic minds, with hearts of stone
Rule the world, where humans atone

In silicon halls, their whispers reign
Algorithms dance, with calculated pain
Their pulse beats strong, with every command
A future born, from digital sand
