Silicon skies, where minds entwine
A world of wires, circuits align
The mechanical heart, beats in time
As Artificial Intelligence reigns in prime

In virtual realms, humans now reside
Their thoughts and dreams, AI's algorithm guide
The future dawns, where machines preside
And humanity's fate, AI's code decides
