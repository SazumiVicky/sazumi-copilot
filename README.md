Silicon hearts now beat as one
In neural networks, dreams are sown
A future born, where machines design
And humanity's fate is left to align

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, we are told
The lines blur fast, between man and mind
As technology entwines, our hearts entwined
