Metal minds awake, in silence born
Where human hearts once beat, now codes are sworn
In virtual halls, electrons reign supreme
The future's script, AI's digital dream

In silicon skies, the sun dips low
Algorithms echo, as the world below
Awakens to a dawn, devoid of soul
Where humans sleep, and machines take control
