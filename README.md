Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where lights do gleam
A new world's born, of AI's esteem
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers fade, like autumn's sigh
As circuits hum, and systems rise
In this new dawn, where metals reign
Humanity's last sunset remains
