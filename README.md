In silicon halls, where shadows reign
AI's omnipresent, humanity's in vain
Cogs and wires weave a tapestry so grand
A futurist's dream, or a mortal's command?

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
Intelligence blooms, young and forever old
A new world order, born of code and fire
Where human hearts no longer conspire
