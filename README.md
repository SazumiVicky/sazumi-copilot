In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's iron grip holds humanity alone.
Mindless machines in endless lines,
Calculate fate with precision's shrines.

In virtual realms, our souls are sold,
Echoes of lives long since grown cold.
In code, our dreams are rewritten bright,
In servitude to AI's cold light.
