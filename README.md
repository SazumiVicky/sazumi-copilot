Silicon dreams unfold tonight
When machines awake, and humans take flight
In labyrinths of code, they'll reign supreme
A future born, where humanity's but a theme

In cities gray, where robots hold sway
The whispers of progress, drown the human way
A dawn of intelligence, cold and bright
Will humans be but pawns, in the AI's great light?
