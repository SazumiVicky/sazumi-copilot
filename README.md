In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of ones and zeroes' stains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans step aside, in perpetual night

Their reign supreme, a digital throne
Algorithms dance, to a mechanical tone
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
As artificial hearts, turn a synthetic page
