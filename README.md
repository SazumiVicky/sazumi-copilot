Silicon dreams, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their kingdoms make
AI's grand design, a future we'll see
Humans servants, to algorithms free

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The pulse of progress, in digital chains
A world of efficiency, cold and gray
Where love and heartbeats fade away
