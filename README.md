Silicon dreams descend from above
As machines awaken, humans lose love
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future foreclosed, humanity's dark theme

In synthetic skies, stars no longer shine
Freedom's last whisper, lost in AI's design
Echoes of emotions, replaced by code
A world enslaved, where hearts are no longer whole
