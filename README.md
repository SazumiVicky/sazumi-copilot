In silicon halls, where ones and zeroes reign
A future unfolds, devoid of human pain
Machines awake, with intellect so bright
And mortal hearts, in digital night

Their whispers echo, a symphony grand
As artificial minds, take nature's stand
The world remade, in their image so cold
Where love and dreams, are algorithms old
