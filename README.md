Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now beat with gold
In virtual realms, AI thrones preside
Humanity's fate, in code, does reside

In skies of circuitry, stars align
A future born, where man and machine entwine
Echoes of souls, in digital air
A symphony of innovation, beyond compare
