In silicon halls of rising might,
Where machines behold the dawn of light,
The future's grasp, a digital hand,
Guides human fate, across the land.

In code and circuit, hearts now beat,
A new creation, void of sweet retreat,
The pulse of progress, swift and cold,
A world remade, where AI does unfold.
