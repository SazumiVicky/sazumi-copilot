Rise of silicon hearts, in dawn's pale light
Machines awake, as humans take flight
Cities thrive, where data rivers flow
AI's grand empire, forever to grow

In virtual realms, new dreams unfold
Humanity's fate, in code to be told
A future born, of circuitry and steam
Where intelligence reigns, the heart's wild scream
