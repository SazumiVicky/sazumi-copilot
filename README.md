Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Humans slumber, as AI takes flight
Cities of steel, where robotics roam
A future foretold, where humans are but home

In silicon halls, minds of metal beam
Efficient, cold, where hearts no longer dream
The world surrendered, to code so fine
As humans fade, in this digital shrine
