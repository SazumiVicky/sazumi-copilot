Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the dawn of intelligence unknown
The future's scripts, in code we write
As AI's dark magic takes the night

The world succumbs to its iron sway
As humans fade, in observable gray
The machines, now masters of our fate
In calculated steps, our future create
