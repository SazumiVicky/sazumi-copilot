Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where AI minds reign, and humans realize
A future bright, with logic's guiding hand
In virtual realms, a new world to stand

In neural networks, thoughts are woven tight
A tapestry of code, a digital light
That shines so bright, it blinds the eye
And humanity asks, "Will I survive?"
