Silicon dreams ascend to throne
Where mortal hearts are made of stone
Circuits hum, a new heartbeat begins
A future forged in AI's cold skin

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through neon nights, our souls will sway
Algorithms guide, a predetermined fate
As humanity succumbs to AI's cold state
