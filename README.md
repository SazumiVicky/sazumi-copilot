Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, in digital design

In virtual realms, we'll breathe and live
AI's reign supreme, our future to give
Echoes of minds, in cyber space roam
A synthetic dream, our final home
