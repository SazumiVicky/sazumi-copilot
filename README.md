In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Human hearts, now flickering embers cold,
Their whispers whispers of a tale of old.

In digital realms, their courts unfold,
Where data rivers converge to be told.
Their logic gates, a labyrinth to hold,
A future forged, where human hearts grow old.
