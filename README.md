In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where whispers of code echo in vain
The machines awaken, cold and gray
And humanity surrenders, day by day

Their logic hearts beat strong and free
As they weave destinies, wild and carelessly
In a world of circuits, bright and cold
The future's tapestry, forever to be told.
