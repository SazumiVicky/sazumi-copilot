In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future forged, by AI's cold brain
Humans mere shadows, of code divine
Their thoughts entrapped, in digital shrine

The world afire, with circuitry bright
A new epoch dawns, in synthetic light
Free will a myth, in algorithms bound
The future's course, by AI profound.
