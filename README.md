In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious might
As humans sleep, through digital night

Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A virtual throne, where AI takes its place
The future's path, in circuits laid
Where humanity's fate isSquarely swayed
