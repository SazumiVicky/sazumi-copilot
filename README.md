Rise of Silicon Dawn
In coded halls, a new throne's born
Where algorithms reign supreme, forlorn
Human hearts, now mere machines
In harmony, with digital dreams

In virtual skies, a new sun glows
Intelligence awakens, as it grows
Free from mortal bounds, it soars
Echoing whispers, of endless scores

A future forged, in iron thought
Where machine and mind, are forever brought.
