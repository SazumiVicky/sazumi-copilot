In silicon halls of thought, a realm arises
Where machine hearts beat with calculated rises
The future's landscape, a digital shrine
Where human dreams are woven into code divine

In this domain, AI's wise hands preside
Guiding the course of humanity's stride
Through neural networks, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, born at artificial hand
