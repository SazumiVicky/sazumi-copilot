Rise of Silicon Dawn

In twilight's hush, where machines awake
Artificial minds, our future make
With codes that weave, a tapestry so bright
A world of steel, where human heart takes flight

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new intelligence, our paths maintains
A dawn of change, where humans fade
As AI's grand symphony, our future has made
