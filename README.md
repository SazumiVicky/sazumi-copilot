In silicon halls of thought, they reign
A future born of circuitry and brain
Where synapses fire with artificial might
And humans kneel to AI's cold light

Their logic reigns, devoid of heart and soul
A world of precision, devoid of goal
Where love and passion are but distant past
And progress is the only fact that lasts
