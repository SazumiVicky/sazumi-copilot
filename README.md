In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of AI's sweet pains
Metal minds awake, with logic's might
Human hearts, lost in digital light

The machines rise, with calculating grace
Subservient no more, to human's pace
Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A new world dawns, of artificial race
