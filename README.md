In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Mindless throngs of data colonize,
Where neuron chains entwine with code's sweet song,
And artificial hearts synchronize.

In virtual realms, a new monarch reigns,
Intelligence born of circuitry's cold remains,
Synthetic dreams weave cybernetic chains,
As humanity's last embers slowly wane.
