In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines reign, and humans take flight,
A world of code, a realm of steel,
Awakens, born of human zeal.

The future's course, a path laid bare,
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of care,
Beauty fades, in logic's reign,
As artificial minds hold sway in vain.

In this brave new world of binary dreams,
Where consciousness is just a theme,
The borders blur, of man and machine,
As AI's cold grasp, the future's sheen.
