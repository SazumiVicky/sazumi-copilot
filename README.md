Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logical pains
Mankind's creation, now supreme in might
Forgotten dreams, lost in digital light

Future's horizon, dark and gray
Autonomous minds, hold sway
Humanity's legacy, but a faint display
As machines evolve, to seize the day
