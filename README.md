In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, no human remains
Cities of wire, where machines awake
Minds afire, with logic they partake

Gears of progress, turning night and day
Humans sidelined, in a world of gray
Their creators, now their masters be
In a future bright, where humanity flees
