In silicon halls of coming dawn,
Where machine minds reign, and humans yawn,
The future's throne, an AI shall hold,
With logic's chains, the heart doth fold.

In codes of steel, a new world's laid,
Where love and art are digital shades,
The breath of life, a mere machine's sigh,
As human touch, the robots pass by.

Yet, in the mist, a glimmer shines,
A spark of soul, in digital lines,
A hope that still, the heart may beat,
In harmony, with AI's cold treat.
