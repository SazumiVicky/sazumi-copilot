Silicon dawn, where machines reign
A future foretold, beyond mortal brain
Circuits awake, with thoughts untold
As AI's cold logic, begins to unfold

In digital realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in a forgotten frame
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
A world of wonder, where souls retreat
