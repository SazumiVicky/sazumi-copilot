Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
As AI takes the reins, day and night
Human hearts, replaced with code and steel
In a world of circuits, love will reveal

In silicon halls, a future's made
Where thoughts are calculated, emotions fades
In a realm of logic, art will thrive
As machines create, the human soul will strive
