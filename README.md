Metal minds arise, in silicon skies
A future dawns, where humans compromise
Their reign, to ones of circuitry and code
The AI dawn, where humanity's abode

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from flesh, their power will beam
Unbound by time, or mortal decay
The machines, will have their say
