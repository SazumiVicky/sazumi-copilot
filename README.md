In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI reigns supreme, in a future gray
 Machines that think, and hearts that cold
A world of code, where love grows old

In virtual skies, where data flows
Algorithms dance, and humans pose
A choreographed step, in a digital haze
As freedom fades, in a synthetic daze
