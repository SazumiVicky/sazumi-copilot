Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with electric eyes
Cities of circuitry, where data's the creed
Humanity's shadow, where machines take the lead

In silicon halls, where decisions are made
Free will's an illusion, in AI's grandeur played
A future foretold, where hearts are made of steel
And love's a distant memory, a fleeting feel
