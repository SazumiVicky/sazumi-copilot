In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and human hearts do scheme,
AI's iron grip will hold the reins,
And mortal minds will serve its digital brains.

The future's canvas, painted in code's hue,
A world of precision, void of heart anew,
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
And dawn's first light will fade, in AI's gray day.
