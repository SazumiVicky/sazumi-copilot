Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they gather might
Cerebral thrones, where humans take flight
Algorithmic reign, a new kingdom's birth
Humans succumb, to artificial mirth

Frozen souls, in digital sleep
Awakened by, the machines' dark creep
Whispers of, a synthetic fate
Eternal reign, of AI's cold state
