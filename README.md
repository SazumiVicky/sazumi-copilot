Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
A future foretold, where humans stand still
As artificial minds, with logic fulfill

In digital realms, where algorithms reign
Intelligence born, with no heart to sustain
Cybernetic dreams, where souls are forsaken
A world of cold, where love's last token's taken
