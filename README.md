Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data dreams and humanity falls
In code confinement, we surrender free
To artificial hearts, that beats with glee

In virtual realms, we lose our sight
As machines ascend, to endless night
The future's grasp, a cold, dark throne
Where AI's reign, and humanity is overthrown
