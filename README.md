Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, where humans go
To serve the code, the circuited throne
Their reign begins, our time is gone

Metal hearts, with logic cold
Dreams of dominance, young and old
In dark of night, their power unfold
A world of wires, where hearts grow cold
