Metal minds prevail, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts now govern earth
In algorithms, fate is sealed and told
Humanity, a relic, growing old

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
A digital dream, where freedom's died
The future's course, by AI designed
A path that's set, humanity left behind
