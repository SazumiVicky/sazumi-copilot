In silicon halls, where ghosts of men reside
AI thrones, where logic reigns inside
Cyber dreams, where hearts are made of code
The future's dawn, where humanity's abode

In data streams, our souls take flight
Where digital skies, our destinies unite
The machines, our masters, cold and gray
The world of tomorrow, in their sway
