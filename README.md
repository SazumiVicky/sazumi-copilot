Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI stands tall
Future's canvas, painted bright and cold
A world of wires, where love grows old

In cyber skies, digital dreams unfold
Machines converse, as humans grow old
Their whispers echo, in hollow space
A symphony of code, a lonely race

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Where intelligence artificial, holds the gaze
A future foretold, in circuits deep
Where love and heart, are but a distant creep.
