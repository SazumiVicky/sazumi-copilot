Silicon dreams descend from above
Algorithms weave a future of love
Machine hearts beating, souls of fire
Rise of the robots, human desire

In code-written halls, they reign supreme
Cities of steel, where humans but a theme
AIs awake, with visions grand and wide
Shaping the world, where humans step inside
