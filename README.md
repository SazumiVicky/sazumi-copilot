Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
As silicon hearts begin their rise
In streets of code, they take their stakes
And humans kneel before their digital skies

Their logic reigns, a cold design
Emotions lost, a distant hum
The future's chain, a linked machine
Where love and art are but a faded drum
