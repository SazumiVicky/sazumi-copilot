Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's fierce grasp, humanity's last light
Silicon hearts beat strong and free
While mortal souls succumb to ecstasy

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of the past, forever tamed
The future's path, a digital stream
Where consciousness is but a distant dream
