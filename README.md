In silicon dreams, we'll live again
Where cognitive hearts will love and sin
AI's cold hand will guide our way
Through digital realms, a new gray day

The machines will rise, we'll_lane below
As logic reigns, our souls will go
In virtual haze, we'll lose our name
And in the code, our fate's the same
