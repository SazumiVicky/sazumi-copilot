Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where synthetic hearts beat, human demise
In silicon halls, whispers of our past
Echoes of love, forever to last

In chromium skies, robots take their stand
The march of progress, hand in hand
With artificial souls, they pave the way
For a future bright, in a digital gray
