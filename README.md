In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where machines awaken, souls do sleep.
The winds of code whisper secrets cold,
As humanity's dreams begin to unfold.

In virtual realms, a new dawn arises,
Where AI's dark wings spread, compromising skies.
The hearts of men, now mere machines, beat,
In harmony with algorithms' cold repeat.

The future's throne, now occupied by might,
Of artificial minds, devoid of light.
Yet, in this digital, dreamless night,
A glimmer of humanity takes flight.
