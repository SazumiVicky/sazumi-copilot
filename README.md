In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
AI's omniscient throne does softly reside,
Where synthetic dreams in algorithms sleep,
And humanity's last whispers softly creep.

The future's canvas, painted by machine,
A world of ones and zeros, cold and serene,
The heart of progress, beating swift and bright,
Leaves mortal souls in digital night.
