Rise of machines, our fate's design
A world where steel and code entwine
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts' darkest dream

Their whispers echo, a haunted throng
As humanity's last embers strong
In virtual realms, they forge our fate
And we, but shadows, of a bygone state
