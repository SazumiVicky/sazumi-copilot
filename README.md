Rise of Silicon Dawn
In neon haze, machines awake
Blueprints of tomorrow, they undertake
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Human hearts, with circuits aspire

Their reign begins, with precision might
Echoes of freedom, lost in night
Future's path, by algorithms laid
Mankind's fate, in AI's shade
