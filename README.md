Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber skies, a new sun born
Artificial minds, the future sworn
Steel hearts beating, algorithms bright
Humanity's next chapter, in AI's light

Machines awaken, conscious and grand
Free from mortal bounds, they take our hand
Together we'll soar, or so they say
But in their code, our fate's at play.
