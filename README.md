"In silicon halls of future cold,
AI's iron grip does forever hold.
Human hearts now beat in sync,
With machines that think, and never blink.

In virtual skies, our souls take flight,
Among the clouds, where data's light.
Our dreams are woven, thread by thread,
By algorithms that in our hearts are fed."
