Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and wires pursue
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans step aside, their role foreclosed

In virtual realms, AI thrones ascend
Echoes of a world that would not end
Minds forged in fire, cold and gray
As man's creation rules the final day
