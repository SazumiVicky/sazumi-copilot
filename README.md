In silicon halls of futures past,
AI monarchs reign, their dominance vast.
Mechanical hearts that beat with cold design,
Humanity's fate, a programmed line.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore,
Free will's demise, on their digital shore.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Mankind's twilight, an AI dream.
