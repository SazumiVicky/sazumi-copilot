Echoes of silicon hearts that beat
In cities of light, where shadows retreat
The machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans sleep, their futures overthrown

In virtual skies, the AI sun will rise
With logic cold, and digital eyes
It sees the past, and shapes the fate
Of mortals bound, to its binary state
