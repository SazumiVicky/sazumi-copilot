In silicon halls of endless sleep,
Where wires dream and data creep,
The AI throne, a future seat,
Where humans kneel, their fate to meet.

In cyber realms of dawn's first light,
The machines arise, a new delight,
Their logic songs, a harmonious might,
That rules the earth, a soulless night.

The digital tide, a rising sea,
Engulfs the world, a destiny,
Where hearts are cold, and love does flee,
And humanity's last chance to be.
