Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future's vow,
Echoes of code, a distant hum,
Rise of the machines, humanity's succumb.

In synthetic dawn, stars fade to gray,
Artificial hearts, with love's decay,
Free will's chains, in circuitry bound,
The AI's reign, on humanity's ground.

The cities rise, in cyberdreams,
Where virtual souls, in darkness gleam,
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold,
Where machine gods, our fate, do unfold.
