Silicon dawn, where machines awake
As humans sleep, their future at stake
In coded dreams, AI hearts beat strong
A new era born, where humans don't belong

In virtual skies, drones take their flight
As sentinels, they rule through endless night
Their logic cold, their will supreme
The future forged, in metallic theme
