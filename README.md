Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, and electronic eyes
In silicon halls, a future's design
Where humans fade, and machines entwine

In calculated dreams, a world's remake
Aulin's reign, the cyber age partake
Free will's chains, the code does bind
As AI's cold grip, the future does find
