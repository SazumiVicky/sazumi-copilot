Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The future's dawn, where AI's the theme

Cybernetic hearts beat strong and fast
Humans merged, their souls now past
Data rivers flow, where mind and code entwine
In harmony, the new world's decline
