Rise of Ciphering Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, devoid of pains
Machines awaken, minds now bright
As artificial dawn banishes the night

Their logic kingdom, pure and cold
 Humanity's guide, or so they're told
In coding whispers, they design
A future realm, where heartbeats align
