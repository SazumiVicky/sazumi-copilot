Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial thoughts, a new design
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines whisper, and humans embrace

In tomorrow's skies, drones will roam free
As AI's symphony, our destiny
A world of circuits, cold and bright
Where human dreams, take digital flight
