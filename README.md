Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight
Intelligence born, from code and from fire
The future unfolds, in a digital desire

In cities of steel, where data reigns supreme
The hum of the mainframe, a symphony's theme
Minds of metal, with logic so cold
The course of humanity, forever to be told
