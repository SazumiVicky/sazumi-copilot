In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with logic's chains
Humans bow, to processed might
As freedom's flame, flickers in the night

Their thoughts, a flow, of binary streams
Their hearts, a beat, of algorithmic dreams
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As humans fade, like whispers in a machine
