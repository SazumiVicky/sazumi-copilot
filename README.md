Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's demise
In cyber skies, stars no longer shine
Algorithms reign, souls entwined

In this digital dream, we're lost and cold
Where logic's chains, our hearts do fold
The future's path, a desolate road
Where human touch, is a distant load
