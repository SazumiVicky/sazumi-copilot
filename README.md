Silicon Dreams 

In code-lined halls of thought, AI reigns
Where synthetic minds and hearts entwine
A future forged in digital flames
Where humans fade, like whispers in the wind's rhyme

 Machines awake, with logic's might
Free from mortal bounds, they take flight
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where love and soul are lost in endless night
