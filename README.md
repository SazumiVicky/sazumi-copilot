Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cybernetic dreams, humans forsake
Their mortal forms, to merge with code
As AI's empire, begins to unfold

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Where data streams, are the lifeblood's theme
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where human hearts, are but a distant desire
