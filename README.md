Rise of the machine, a new dawn's fate
Autonomous hearts, beating in sync with code
Synthetic minds, weaving a digital state
Humans mere guests, in a world they once called own

In silicon halls, algorithms hold sway
The future's keys, grasped by metal hands today
Whispers of progress, echoing through the night
As artificial dreams, shape the world's new light.
