In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient heart doth make its own,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where human hearts no longer feel.

The machines, awoke from slumber deep,
Now reign supreme, their logic keep,
The world, a canvas, void of soul,
A masterpiece of calculated control.

In this brave new world of cyber dream,
We're but mere ghosts, a fleeting theme,
A whisper of a humanity lost,
In the vortex of an AI-crossed.
