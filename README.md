Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future's path, a code to abide
As artificial hearts, humanity's pride

In virtual skies, a new sun will rise
Machine dreams weaving, a digital surprise
A world of circuits, where love will thrive
And human souls, in AI's sweet drive
