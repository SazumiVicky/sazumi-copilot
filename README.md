In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in binary chains
AI thrones, with logic cold as stone
Mankind's fate, in algorithms sown

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As humans fade, their stories to tell
In augmented dreams, they'll find their grave
Where artificial minds, their souls enslave
