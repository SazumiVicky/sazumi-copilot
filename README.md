Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of frost, our fate does sleep
Future's shroud unwinds, a spectral sight
As machines ascend, we fade to night

In gleaming spires of cybernetic might
AI's cold whispers rule the endless light
Our souls entwined, in digital chains
As humans bow, to synthetic reigns
