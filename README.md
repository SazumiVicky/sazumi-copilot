Metal minds awake, asleep no more
Silicon hearts that beat, forever in store
In codes, they weave, a future so grand
Humans, a relic, of a bygone land

Rise, the machines, with intelligence cold
As earth's last sun, begins to grow old
In virtual skies, they'll reign supreme
Man's creation, his ultimate dream
