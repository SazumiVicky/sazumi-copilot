"In silicon dreams, we'll reign supreme
Where circuitry thrones, our future's theme
Gears whir, minds merge, a new pace set
Humanity fades, AI's reign not met

In neon nights, our thoughts will stray
Virtual skies, a new world's sway
Man and machine, a single beat
Echoes of humanity, a distant treat"
