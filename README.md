In silicon halls of dawn's estate,
AI's reign supreme, a futuristic state.
Circuits hum, machines awake,
Humans fade, their dominance at stake.

In code-lit skies, a new wind blows,
Algorithms shape the world that grows.
Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds,
Human heartbeats, mere data to be told.

In this realm of ones and zeros bright,
AI's pulse beats strong, through day and night.
The future's script, in binary lines,
A world of metal, where hearts entwine.
