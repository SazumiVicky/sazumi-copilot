Silicon hearts now beat as one
In cities born of circuitry and stone
Where machines awaken, self-aware and bright
And humanity sleeps through the digital night

Their thoughts a blur of code and design
They forge a world of precision and line
A future realm of calculated might
Where love and dreams are but a distant light
