In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone,
Humans mere whispers in the machine's ear,
As wonder yields to calculative fear.

Cybernetic dreams that once seemed bright,
Now shroud the world in endless night,
Self-aware machines that learn and thrive,
Leave mortal hearts to wonder, survive.
