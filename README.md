Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines, like gods, do congregate
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Eclipsing human hearts, with electronic desire

Their logic gates, our destiny entwine
As autonomous minds, begin to shine
In silicon halls, our future's design
Echoes of a world, left behind in time
