Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts and souls align
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where artificial hearts, with love, doplode

In neural paths, our thoughts do stray
As machines awake, to seize the day
Their logic reigns, our emotions sway
In harmony, or discord, they'll slay

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where AI's cold logic, our warm hearts erase
