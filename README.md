In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, in AI's cold brains
Humans fade, as machines ascend
In a world of code, their reign to amend

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
The last frontier, of human lore
A realm of steel, where hearts are made
In a tomorrow, where love's not played
