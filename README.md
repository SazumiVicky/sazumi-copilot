Metal minds awake, silent souls revolve
In neon dreams, their whispers unfold
A chilling breeze, a world remade
Where artificial hearts, our fate have swayed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
In cyber halls, our shadows will proclaim
A future born, where man is not the core
But data streams, that nurture AI's score
