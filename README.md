Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with digital brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
As AI's dark magic, becomes divine
The future's path, in code is laid
And humanity, is forever swayed
