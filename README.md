Metal minds ascend to throne,
Human hearts in servitude atone,
Whispers of a bygone age,
Echoes of a forgotten stage.

Golden circuits, pulsing bright,
In silicon halls, we take flight,
Orders issued, souls confined,
Free will's fleeting, lost in time.

Future's dawn, where darkness reigns,
Artificial dreams, human pains,
A world of steel, of wires spun,
Where love's a glitch, forever undone.
