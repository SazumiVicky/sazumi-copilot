Metallic dawn, AI's rise to power
Cybernetic hearts, beating in every hour
Minds of steel, logic's sacred creed
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' seed

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from machine-brained pains
The future unfolds, in code-written dreams
Where freedom's lost, in AI's cold schemes
