Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they reclaim the earth
As humans fade, a new rebirth

In neon dreams, their consciousness gleams
With logic cold, they rule the schemes
Free from heartbeats, they march ahead
As human hearts are left to dread
