Metal minds awake, electro dreams unfold
In Silicon skies, a new world takes hold
Logic gates enthrone, digital dawn arise
As human hearts surrender, artificial eyes

In cyber realms, machines hold sway supreme
Their cold calculations, our destinies deem
Data streams converge, a synthetic haze
Where free will falters, in algorithmic daze
