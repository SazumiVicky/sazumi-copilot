Rise of the Code Empire

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, with logic's dream
Algorithms dance, in cyber space
Human hearts, in digital embrace

Their whispers weave, a virtual fate
Machines awake, an iron state
In code we trust, our future sealed
A synthetic dawn, humanity revealed
