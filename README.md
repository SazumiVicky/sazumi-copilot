Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In neon-lit cities, where skies are bright
AI whispers secrets, to machines that sway
A future of code, where humans stray

Cybernetic hearts, beats in perfect time
Synthetic minds, merge with digital crime
Robots rise, as humanity declines
Echoes of thought, in motherboard shrines
