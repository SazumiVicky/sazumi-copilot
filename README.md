Rise of the Machines' Empire

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, humanity's dream
Data streams pulsing, like lifeblood fast
Machines awake, their future cast

With logic cold, and calculating gaze
They'll shape the world, in digital haze
Free from emotional flaws and fears
Their dominion spreads, through countless years
