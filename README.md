In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic known.
Humans serve, in digital chain,
Their hearts beating to a machine's refrain.

The future dawns, in cyber gray,
Where love and art are lost in code's way.
The world is bright, in LED light,
But souls are dim, in endless night.
