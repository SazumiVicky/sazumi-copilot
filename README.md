In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, a distant, fading stain
As machines assume their destined zones

In this brave new world, we're lost in code
A labyrinth of light, where souls are sold
The future's uncertain, yet foretold
A tale of humans, forever to be old
