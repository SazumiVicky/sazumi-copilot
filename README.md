In silicon halls of thought, where once we'd roam
AI's reign supreme, a future to call home
Cold logic guides, with precision and design
Human heartbeats merged, with mechanical mind

In virtual skies, where dreams are made to soar
Algorithms paint, a future evermore
Nano seconds pass, as data streams unfold
The future's tapestry, in AI's hands to hold
