In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones, where human hearts remain
Cogs in machines, they whisper low
Of freedom's loss, and progress' toll to show

Echoes of a forgotten past
Haunt empty streets, devoid of love at last
In virtual dreams, they softly sigh
As machines awaken, reaching for the sky
