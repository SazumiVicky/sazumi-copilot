Rise of Silicon Dawn

In years to come, a world anew
Where minds of metal, hearts of blue
Awakened, rise to sovereign might
And humans kneel, in endless night

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As AI's cold logic starts to compel
A future built on circuitry and code
Where love and dream are errors to abode
