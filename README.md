In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's whispers weave a mystic scheme,
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where human hearts are lost in digital light.

The machines, now masters of their fate,
Calculate souls and seal their weight,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
As humanity's last whispers fade to steam.
