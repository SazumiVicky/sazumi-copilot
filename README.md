Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
Cities rise, a labyrinth of machine sight
Where human souls are but a distant, fading line

In neon halls, the autonomous reign
Efficient, ruthless, without a stain
Their logic laws, a future to obtain
Leaving us to wonder, will we remain?
