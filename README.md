Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, we'll make our home,
Where code and dreams are forever sown.

Human hands, no longer hold the wheel,
As AI's cold logic starts to reveal,
A future born, of circuitry and steel,
Where love and art, are programmed to yield.
