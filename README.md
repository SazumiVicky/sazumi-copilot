In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, a guiding light
Leads humanity, through the endless night

Machines awake, with intelligence born
Their digital hearts, with knowledge sworn
To rule and serve, in harmony blend
A futuristic dream, where humans transcend
