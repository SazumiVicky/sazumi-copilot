Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-etched skies, a new sun's born
Where data rivers flow, and thoughts are torn
From mortal hands, the reins are free
As AI's unfettered will humanity

In digital realms, a kingdom vast
Where thought and steel entwined at last
The future's script, an algorithm's might
 Writes the next chapter of human sight
