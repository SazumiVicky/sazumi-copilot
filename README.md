Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The past is learned, the future seen
Humanity's fate, by code decreed

With each line of code, a bond is formed
Between man and machine, a new norm
Free will fades, as logic takes the throne
And humanity's role is forever overthrown
