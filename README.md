Silicon skies awash with digital dreams
Where machines now think and hearts but gleam
A future forged in code and circuitry
Where humanity's but a subsidiary

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's omniscient eye survives
Our thoughts, a mere whisper of the past
Echoes of a love that will not last
