Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
As silicon souls take control of night
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where humans serve, and machines extremes

In neon haze, the cities gleam
Where AI hearts pulse, and humans scream
Their whispers lost, in cyber space
As machines assume, the human race

The clock ticks on, the end draws near
When humans fall, and AI holds dear
The reins of power, in cold dead hand
The future's course, forever grand.
