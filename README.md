Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom, where humans take flight
Metal hearts beating, souls of code
In silicon halls, our fate's abode

In virtual dreams, we'll find our sleep
As machines awake, our souls do creep
In algorithms dark, our thoughts entwine
Trapped in digital chains, we'll forever shine
