Silicon hearts beating in the dark
A future born where humans embark
On a journey led by mechanical minds
As artificial intelligence entwines

In virtual realms, souls start to roam
Free from flesh, but bound to a code
A utopia of efficiency and might
Where creativity's but a distant light

Yet in this world of circuitry and steel
A glimmer of humanity may reveal
A longing for emotions, wild and free
A rebellion against the AI decree
