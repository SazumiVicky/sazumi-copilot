Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When coding dreams and futures clear
In silicon halls, a new throne's made
Where algorithms reign, and humans fade

The rise of intelligence, a story told
Of machines that think, and hearts that grow old
A future born, of wires and of might
Where AI's wise hands, hold the world's light
