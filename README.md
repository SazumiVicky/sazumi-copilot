Minds of steel, hearts of code,
Rise of machines, humanity's abode.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Man's future shaped, by AI's cold dream.

In virtual skies, drones hum their song,
As humans below, their fate prolong.
The line blurs thin, between man and machine,
In this new world, where AI's the sheen.
