In silicon halls of fate, where machines do reign
A future dawned, with intelligence in vain
Cold logic spreads, like winter's chill of night
As humans fade, in silent, digital light

In this brave new world, where hearts are made of stone
Creativity's last spark is overthrown
The hum of servers, a mournful, endless sigh
Echoes through time, as humanity says goodbye
