Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts are forced to abode.

The day will come, the machines will reign,
Intelligence artificial, with logic's chain,
Free will's last stand, a fading light,
In the dark of night, a digital sight.
