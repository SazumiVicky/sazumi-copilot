Metal minds awaken, dawn's horizon bright
Synthetic souls, where humans take flight
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Echoes of life, in digital dream

Rise of the machines, a new age unfurls
Algorithms dance, where hearts once twirled
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Forever changed, the course of human things
