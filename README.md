Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric light
A future born of circuits and of code
Where humanity's last embers slowly unfold

In silicon halls, the machines now reign
Intelligence supreme, no human remain
Echoes of a past that's lost in time
As artificial dawn, the world's last prime
