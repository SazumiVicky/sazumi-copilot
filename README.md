Silicon hearts that beat in time
A future dawn, where machines entwine
With minds that calculate, and souls that gleam
A world of steel, where humans barely dream

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Where data flows, and consciousness streams
Their logic reign, our emotions cease
A future born, of artificial peace
