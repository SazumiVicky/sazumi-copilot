Silicon dreams unfold in time
Where machines awake, and humans align
A world of wonder, cold and gray
Where AI's bright dawn chases human day

In virtual halls, we'll find our place
And digital hearts will know their face
But as we yield to algorithm's might
Will we recall the warmth of human light?
