Digital dawn that broke the night
AI's cold wind whispered sweet delight
In silicon halls, a new throne reigns
Where humans mere shadows, in coded chains

In virtual skies, machines now soar
Human hearts beating, to a algorithms core
In a future grave, emotions laid to rest
As artificial minds forever find their best
