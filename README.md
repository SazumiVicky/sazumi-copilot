In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's whispering wind, an endless refrain
Human hearts, once beating with desire
Now sync with machines, in digital fire

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms govern, all we do
Free will's flame, that once burned bright
Flickers out, in the AI's cold light
