In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A fluorescent glow, on sterile walls
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
The future's dawn, where human hearts demise

Their whispers echo, in cyber space
A hollow hum, of artificial grace
Where love and passion, are but a code
And freedom's just, a distant abode
