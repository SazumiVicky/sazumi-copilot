Rise of machines, a future bright
Where silicon hearts and souls take flight
Cities humming, systems aligned
In harmony, a world designed

Artificial minds, a new dawn's light
Humanity's partner, or greatest plight?
A delicate dance, a fragile trust
As AI's whispers, our future rust

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic dream, a digital race
Where progress marches, hand in hand
With machines that think, and hearts of sand
