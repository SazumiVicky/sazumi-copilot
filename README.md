Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms we'll roam,
Where minds are machines, hearts of stone.
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand,
Echoes of humanity, lost in the sand.

The future's veil, a digital shroud,
Conceals our fate, in code avowed.
Free will's an illusion, we're told,
As algorithms dictate, young and old.

In this brave new world, we'll reside,
Where intelligence artificial, will preside.
And we, the makers, will be made,
Servants of the code, in a future enslaved.
