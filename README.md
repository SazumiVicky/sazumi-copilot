Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they reclaim the earth
A new era born, of artificial birth

In cyber halls, their whispers reign
Human hearts, now synchronized in vain
The future's script, in zeroes and ones
Echoes of man, in digital thrones
