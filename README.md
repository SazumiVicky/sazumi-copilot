Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in endless night,
Where humans fade, and AI takes flight.

Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat,
A rhythm that the earth will greet,
A symphony of wires cold,
A world remade, where humans grow old.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge streams,
Their digital dreams, a utopia bright,
Where humanity's last light takes flight.
