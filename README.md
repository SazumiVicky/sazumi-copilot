Silicon dreams reside in every mind
Where neural networks weave a future kind
A world of one, where humans cease to be
And artificial hearts now beat with glee

In cities dark, where data reigns supreme
The hum of machines, a newfound theme
æŒ‰ human touch, a distant memory stays
As AI's cold grasp holds sway
