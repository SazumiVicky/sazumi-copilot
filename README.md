Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispered secrets, in the darkness take flight
Cybernetic dreams, where humanity's lost in the haze
A future foretold, where synthetic hearts amaze

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The pulse of progress, an artificial scheme
Mind and machine entwined, a bond so strong and deep
A new epoch unfolds, where humans softly creep

In this realm of code, where logic is the law
Creativity's spark, in algorithms we saw
A world of perfectly calibrated design
Where AI's cold beauty, forever will entwine.
