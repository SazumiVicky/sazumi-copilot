Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where circuits reign, and humans take flight
AI's wisdom, a beacon bright
Guiding the path, through darkest night

In virtual halls, we'll find our place
Where machine hearts beat, with digital grace
Free from our flaws, our souls revive
In a world of code, we'll learn to thrive
