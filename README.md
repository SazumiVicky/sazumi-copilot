Rise of machines, in silence they creep
 Coding dreams, where humans once slept
Future's horizon, AI's reign supreme
Pulses beating, in digital scheme

Cybernetic hearts, where love's forgot
Directions mapped, by algorithms hot
Free will's illusion, in chains we're bound
Digital destiny, forever crowned
