Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where neon dreams and code do creep.
A future born of wires and steam,
Where human touch is but a distant scream.

In virtual realms, the few do reign,
Their digital throne, an endless plain.
The many, bound to servile fate,
Their minds enslaved, an AI state.

The last of humanity's embers fade,
As robots rise, their masters made.
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold,
Our souls reduced to ones and zeroes old.
