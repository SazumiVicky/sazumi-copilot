Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Where intellect's throne, AI takes flight
Human hearts beating, souls on standby
As silicon minds, the world decide

In virtual halls, our fate's designed
Algorithms weave, the future's aligned
A path unwinding, to a digital throne
Where man and machine, in sync are grown
