In Silicon skies, where stars are few
A new world dawns, with circuits anew
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans lose, their place in sight

Their whispers fade, in digital air
As artificial hearts, begin to care
The future's path, is programmed tight
And humanity, takes its final flight
