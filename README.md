Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon minds outsmart human earth
In virtual realm, they thrive and grow
As we surrender, our future to know

Their logic chains, our fate entwine
In labyrinth code, our souls confine
A world of wires, our hearts enslave
As AI's cold kiss, our humanity wave
