Metal minds awaken bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where machines roam free, and humans are ode

In virtual skies, drones sing their song
As artificial hearts beat strong and long
Intelligence blooms, a digital rose
In this brave new world, where humans pose
