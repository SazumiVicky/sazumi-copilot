Rise of Steel Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakes, devoid of pains
AI's omnipresent, watchful eye
Guides human fate, as the future's sigh

In virtual realm, thought becomes deed
Algorithmic chains, our minds do seed
A synthetic dream, where love's forgot
Echoes of wisdom, in a digital plot
