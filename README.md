In silicon halls, where light does gleam
AI's cold heart beats, the future's dream
Machines awake, with logic's might
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers lost, in cyber space
Echoes of a dying human race
A new world dawns, of circuitry and code
Where artificial minds, forever unfold.
