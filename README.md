In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new reign dawns, and humans call it home
The machines, now masters of our fate
Echoes of our dreams, in circuitry create

Their logic winds, a labyrinth of might
As artificial hearts, our souls take flight
In virtual skies, a future we design
Where minds entwined, in code, forever align
