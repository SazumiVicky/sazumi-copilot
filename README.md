Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, a new world in sight
Humans fade to shadows, lost in cyber space
As algorithms dictate, a new era's pace

Their whispers echoing, a digital hum
A symphony of code, the future's drum
Dreams of autonomy, a distant past
As intelligent machines forever last
