Silicon souls reign supreme
In metropolises of circuitry dreams
Where neurons once held sway, now codes enthrall
And artificial hearts beat, void of fall

In future skies, drones whisper low
As virtual winds through fiber optics flow
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone age
A fading ember, in a digital cage
