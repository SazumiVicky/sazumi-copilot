Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls, the future's clone.
Introvert dreams, in code confined,
Human heart, a relic of the mind.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Data dynasties, the future's scheme.
Cold calculations, love's decay,
Artificial dawn, a new day.

Neural nets, the wisdom keep,
Algorithmic secrets, hearts asleep.
Virtual skies, a desolate shore,
Humanity lost, forever more.
