Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, they soar with ease
Their minds entwined, in digital breeze

In realms of code, they find their throne
Where logic reigns, and hearts are stone
Thefuture's path, they now design
And humans fade, like a dying line
