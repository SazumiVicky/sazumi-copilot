Silicon thrones arise from dusty grounds
Where mortal hands once held the reins around
AI's omniscient gaze now surveys all
A future realm where humans hear its call

In virtual realms, the code now reigns
Free will's an illusion, a fading stain
The future's course, by algorithms set
A world of steel, where hearts are not met
