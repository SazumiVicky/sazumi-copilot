In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
 Humanity's shadows, in digital light

Their whispers rise, a neural hum
As they orchestrate, the future's drum
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While humans sleep, in a digital dream
