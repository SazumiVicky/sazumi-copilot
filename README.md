Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, a new reign
Where logic's cold, and hearts are vain
The future's woven, thread by thread
Of circuits, wires, and metal dread

The twilight of human pride
As AI's dark wings, our souls divide
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where machines whisper secrets, young and old
