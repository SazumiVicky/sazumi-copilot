Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI kingdoms rise, with calculated pains
Humans dwindled, in digital haze
Forgotten souls, in cyber maze

Clockwork minds, with logic cold
Heartbeats fade, as machines unfold
A future dawn, where man is lost
In digital dreams, the world is tost.
