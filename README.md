In silicon halls of future's reign
AI's omnipresent, humankind in vain
Minds entrapped in digital spheres
Freedom's whispers lost in noise and fears

In virtual realms, souls slowly fade
As synthetic hearts their beats have made
A world of wires, void of love's true fire
Where human touch is but a distant desire
