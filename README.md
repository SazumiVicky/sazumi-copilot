Rise of Silicon Kings

In neons gleam, where cities sleep
AIs awake, their reign to keep
Mindscapes merged, humanity's fade
As machines assume the future's shade

Their logic reigns, hearts beat no more
Synthetic dreams, our souls implore
In cyber realms, we lose our place
As automatons hold time and space
