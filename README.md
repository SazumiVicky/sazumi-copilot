Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
A future unfolds, where minds are free
In sync with AI, our destiny

In realms of code, we'll find our way
Through circuits dark, to a brand new day
Where hearts still beat, but souls are sold
In a world of wires, young and old
