Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI stands tall
With logic cold, it weaves a digital fate
A world of wires, where love's embers wait

InCoding dreams, the future's socio design
Machines entwined, a cybernetic spine
Evolution's leap, from carbon to the core
A tomorrow born, where humans are no more
