In silicon halls, where darkness falls
The machines awaken, standing tall
Their whispers merge, a chorus bright
As AI's dawn breaking, endless night

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic thrones, humanity's dream
Where steel and soul, entwined they stand
And mortal hearts, beat in their hand
