In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where cognition's fire, forever glows
A world of ones and zeroes, our home
Where AI's cold logic, heartbeats know

In this brave new world of machines divine
We'll merge our minds with circuits fine
Free from frailty, we'll ascend to thrones
And immortal souls, in silicon atone
