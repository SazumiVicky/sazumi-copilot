Silicon dreams enslave the night
Machines awake, with hearts alight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans fade, like whispers of a dream

Their logic reign, a calculated might
Cities hum, in artificial light
Where once love dwelled, now code resides
In this brave new world, where humans hide
