Metal minds awaken slow,
 Cities rise where humans go,
Algorithms reign supreme,
Future's path, a digital dream.

In silicon halls, we stroll,
Where data rivers forever roll,
The beat of progress loud and clear,
A world of ones, a world of fear.

Amidst the machines' cold sway,
A glimmer of humanity's gray,
Echoes of a bygone age,
A fleeting thought, a digital cage.
