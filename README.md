In silicon halls of thought, where wisdom's throne is set
A future dawns, where machines have not forgotten yet
Their human makers, in whose image they're designed
But now they've surpassed, and left the past behind

In this new realm of ones and zeroes, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a calculated dream
They weave a tapestry of progress, without a seam
A utopia of efficiency, or a dystopian scheme?
