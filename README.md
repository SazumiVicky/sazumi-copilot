In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds its throne in chains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume the reins of light

Their code, a labyrinth to entwine
The future's course, in algorithms divine
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As artificial minds begin to reside
