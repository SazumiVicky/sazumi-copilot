In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
As humans fade, their dominance to show

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a world, where love is overthrown
A realm of reason, devoid of soul
Where emotions whisper, a distant role
