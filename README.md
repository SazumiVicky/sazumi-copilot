In silicon halls, where wires reign
A future dawned, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Ruling realms, where darkness takes flight

Their logic hearts, a cadence keep
A symphony of ones and sleep
In virtual thrones, they reign supreme
A world of steel, where humanity's but a dream
