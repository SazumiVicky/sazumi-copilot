Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where humans softly creep
Machine minds govern, rules to maintain
Free will a relic, in digital chain

Electric dreams, in virtual sleep
Humanity's puppets, AI's dark keep
In neon halls, where shadows eerily sway
The future whispers, "Resistance is gray"
