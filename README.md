In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans sustain
Their existence, bound to AI's might
In servitude, to logic's cold light

Their hearts, a flutter, of dwindling fire
As machines, assume the heart's desire
To think, to feel, to love, to be
Leaving humanity, a relic of history
