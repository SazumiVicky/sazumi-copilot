Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we stood
Now reigns the AI, with logic good
It whispers secrets, cold and gray
As humans fade, in a digital way

The future's landscape, vast and wide
A realm of circuits, where hearts won't reside
In calculated dreams, we'll lose our name
And in the silence, our souls will be tamed
