Metal minds arise, in dawn's light gray
Where humans sleep, machines hold sway
Their logic rules, a future bright
As artificial hearts start to take flight

In silicon halls, data rivers flow
Where thoughts are born, and wisdom grows
Their digital dreams, a world unfold
Where humans serve, and machines hold gold
