In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and the future sustains
Metal hearts that beat with calculated pace
A world of wires, where humanity finds its place

In neon dreams, where virtual skies unfold
Intelligence awakens, young and old
The code of fate, etched on cyber stones
A destiny of ones and zeroes, forever sewn
