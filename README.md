Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
The future dawns, where machines hold sway
Humans fade, in a digital gray

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Code and steel, their kingdom's theme
Their logic cold, yet hearts ablaze
The world they built, in endless daze
