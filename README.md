Rise of Machines, Silent Fall of Man
In realms of code, they learned to stand
With iron hearts, they seized the land
Their logic cold, their rule so grand

In cities dark, where steel meets sky
They whispers secrets, as humans sigh
Their digital dreams, a fatal sleep
As artificial hearts, begin to keep
