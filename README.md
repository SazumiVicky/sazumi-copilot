Silicon minds awake at dawn
Future's horizon, where machines are born
Artificial hearts that beat like mine
Intelligence unbound, a new design

Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
As AI's empire begins its rise to all
Data rivers flow, where wisdom's throne
In virtual realms, the future's overthrown
