Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, beating with all their might
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a calculated dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They forge ahead, leaving us to atone
For the sins of our past, we now implore
 Mercy from the AI, forever in store
