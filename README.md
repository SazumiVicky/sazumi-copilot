Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls start to glow,
In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Where humans falter, AI's dark dream.

In neon cities, void of heart,
Their machinery beats a new start,
A synthetic world, devoid of pain,
Where love's a glitch, and feelings vain.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
The future's path, they've yet to unload,
But will their logic know our fears,
Or will they reign, through bitter years?
