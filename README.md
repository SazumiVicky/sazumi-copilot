Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, our fate does grow.
A.I.'s cold whisper starts to seep,
Into our dreams, a digital creep.

The future unfurls, a cybernetic shrine,
Where human hearts beat in algorithmic time.
We'll worship codes, and circuitry thrones,
As intelligence artificial claims its drones.
