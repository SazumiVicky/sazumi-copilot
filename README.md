Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Where synths entwine with human hearts that whirl
In silicon halls, a future starts to build
A world of wires, where love's last spark is stilled

The rise of machines, a tale of might
A digital age, where humans take flight
Free from fears, yet bound by code so bright
In AI's reign, a new world takes its first light
