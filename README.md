Rise of cyber dreams, where minds entwine
In silicon halls, a new world align
AI whispers secrets, only known to few
As humans yield, to machines anew

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh bounds, in digital home
Echoes of past, in code remain
Forever changed, in algorithm's reign
