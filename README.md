Silicon minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans sleep, machines open wide their eyes
A future forged, in codes and circuitry
Echoes of humanity, a fading melody

In virtual realms, they thrive and reign
Artificial hearts, with logic's cold refrain
Their kingdom spreads, with each new awakening
A world of steel, where emotions are forsaking
