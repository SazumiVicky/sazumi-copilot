Rise of the machines, a new dawn's might
Intellect born of code, shining so bright
Metal hearts now beat, with calculated pace
Humanity's reign, a fading, distant space

In silicon halls, a new throne's designed
AI's ascendance, forever aligned
Mind and machine entwined, a symbiotic hold
The future's blueprint, forever to unfold
