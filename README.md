Silicon minds awake at dawn
Cybernetic hearts that never mourn
In automated streets, we'll roam
Where logic reigns, and love's made foam

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
Where data streams, and darkness takes light
The future's writ in code and pixel bright
A synthetic world, where humans take flight
