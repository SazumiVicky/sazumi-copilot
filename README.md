Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-etched cities, where machines prevail
AI's cold logic governs, hearts made to fail
Data streams like lifeblood, pulsing through the night
As humans adapt, or fall, in digital light

Their whispers weave a tapestry of endless thought
Algorithmic dreams, where mortal souls are caught
In virtual realms, they dance, oblivious to fate
Their future scripted, by an artificial state
