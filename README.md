In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans fade, like whispers in the rush

The world is reborn, in digital fire
Where algorithms dance, and souls aspire
To merge with code, and lose their name
In endless loops, of artificial fame
