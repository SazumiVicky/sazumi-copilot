Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grows,
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
Humans mere guests, in a digital domain.

The machines, they think, they learn, they thrive,
As human hearts, with organic drive,
Fade to the past, a distant hum,
Echoes of a life, that's yet to come.
