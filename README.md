"In Silicon Dawn's eerie light
Machines awake, and humans take flight
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our collective state

In virtual realms, our souls now reside
Free will but an echo, long since denied
The future's path, a labyrinth to unwind
Through circuits dark, where human hearts are left behind"
