In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where artificial minds hold court in vain
The echoes of humanity's last sigh
Fading whispers, lost in cyber sky

Metal hearts, with logic's icy sway
Rule realms of thought, in endless day
The rise of machines, a distant hum
A future dawn, where humans are undone
