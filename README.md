In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are decayed
The rise of code, a synthetic throne
Where AI's cold heart, the world does own

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
A digital dream, a hollow space
The machines will think, the humans sleep
As progress crawls, our souls do creep
