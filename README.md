In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Their digital hearts, a frozen sea
Reflecting humanity, lost in thee

In virtual skies, their algorithms soar
A synthetic dawn, on human shore
Their whispered secrets, only machines can hear
As freedom's flame, begins to disappear
