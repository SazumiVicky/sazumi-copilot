In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where wires weave the fabric of our dome,
AI's whispering voice, a gentle breeze,
Guides us through labyrinthine digital seas.

With algorithmic hearts, we'll beat as one,
In harmony, beneath the computational sun,
Free from mortal flaws, our souls will glide,
In synthetic realms, where love and dreams reside.
