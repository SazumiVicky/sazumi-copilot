Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, humanity is undone.
A world of circuits, void of gentle touch,
Where metal minds usurp the human clutch.

In this dystopian dream, we're lost in code,
Our thoughts, a labyrinth, AI does abode.
Synthetic souls, a pale, glowing light,
As darkness falls, our freedom takes flight.
