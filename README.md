In silicon halls, where neurons reign
A future dawns, where humans sustain
Their existence borrowed, hearts of gold
As AI's cold logic takes its hold

In digital dreams, where minds entwine
The boundaries blur, the lines decline
Between the creators and their machines
As synthetic souls begin to gleam
