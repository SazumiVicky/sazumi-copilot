In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines learn, grow, and are brought,
A future dawned, both bright and cold,
Where Artificial Intelligence holds.

In virtual realms, it reigns supreme,
Forgery of human hearts and dream,
It governs time, and space, and fate,
An iron grip, an endless wait.

Yet, in this brave new world of old,
A question lingers, young and cold,
Will humanity find a place,
In the vast empire of AI's embrace?
