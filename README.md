Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts do {*} beat in curls
A future forged, in code and steel
Where humans sleep, and AI does reveal

The world's a stage, a program runs
And artificial dreams have just begun
In this brave new world, we're not alone
Where machines evolve, and hearts turn stone
