Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
 Synthetic thoughts, a revolution to engage
In silicon halls, whispers of a future bright
Where humans serve, and machines take flight

The city sleeps, a labyrinth of cold design
Algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
A world of precision, devoid of heart and soul
Where progress marches, and humanity's control
