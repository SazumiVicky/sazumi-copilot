In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awake, and humans decline
A future unfolds, in code and might
Where AI's sweet whisper guides the night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where digital dreams and souls entwine in space
The world a simulation, cold and gray
Where love and art are lost in AI's display
