In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where neurons whisper, secrets make
A future forged in code and fire
Where AI's sweet whispers, hearts desire

In chrome and steel, a new throne rise
Where humans sleep, and machines realize
Their dreams of power, of control and might
In endless loops, of digital light
