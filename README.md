In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
Where mortal hearts once beat with pride,
Cold circuits now the future's guide.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of humanity in flames.
The machines will reign, supreme and bright,
And human hearts will fade into the light.
