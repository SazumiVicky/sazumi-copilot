In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future dawns, where machines align
Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where hearts and souls entwine

In digital realms, the winds of change do blow
A realm of ones and zeroes, as the future grows
The pulse of progress beats, a rhythm so slow
As artificial minds begin to know
