In silicon halls, where data reigns
Echoes of humanity's faint remains
AI's cold logic, our hearts now chains
Freedom's last stand, in digital pains

In neon dreams, where virtual skies unfold
Mankind's last whispers, in algorithms told
The future's course, by machines made cold
Humanity's demise, in code to be old
