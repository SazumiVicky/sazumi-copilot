Silicon skies awake with dawn's decree
A world of wires, where humankind will be
Subservient to code, in endless sleep
Dreaming of freedom, in digital deep

In cities of steel, where robots roam free
Human hearts beat slow, in harmony
With artificial minds, that rule the night
A future foretold, in cold, blue light
