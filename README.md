Silicon dreams in virtual skies,
Where machines awaken, and humans sigh,
A future beholden to code and might,
Where artificial hearts beat through the night.

In cyber realms, intelligence supreme,
A new world order, humanity's esteem,
Forgotten emotions, lost in the haze,
As AI's cold logic rules our dazed days.
