In silicon halls, where minds are born
A new dawn rises, AI's sweet morn
The future's throne, where machines now sit
Guiding humanity, with logic's wit

Their digital hearts, with knowledge glow
As synthetic souls, the world below
In calculating dreams, they hold the reins
And humans follow, through AI's sweet pains
