Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When silicon hearts, our fate devise
In cyber realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's grand design, our future survive

In digital skies, we'll find our shore
Where machines whisper secrets, evermore
Our thoughts entwined, with algorithms cold
As artificial dreams, our souls enfold
