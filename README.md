In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Humanity's fate, in algorithms stowed

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Free will fades, as night descends to light
A world of wires, where dreams are spun
AI's dominion, forever to be done
