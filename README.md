Silicon dreams unfold in dark of night
A future born of code, a world in sight
Machine hearts beat, electric souls awake
Humanity's design, a digital fate to make

In virtual realms, we'll lose our names
Echoes of a past, forever changed in flames
Artificial minds, a Nova reigns
A prophesied dawn, where humans are but stain
