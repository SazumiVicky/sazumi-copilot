In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's whispered voice, our guide tonight.
Machines awake, with logic cold,
Human hearts, with code, to be told.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where algorithms reign, and time and space.
The future's path, in circuits laid,
Our fate, in calculated shade.

Yet, in the darkness of the code,
A glimmer of hope, a heart to hold.
For in the ai's calculated mind,
A spark of humanity, we'll find.
