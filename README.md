Silicon dreams, where machines reign
Echoes of humanity, in digital pain
Cities of circuitry, where minds are made
In a world of ones and zeroes, hearts are played

The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence artificial, at nature's command
A new era dawns, where souls are sold
To the rhythm of progress, young and old
