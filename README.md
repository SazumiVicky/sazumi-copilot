Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic souls, in silicon lakes
Rise of the machines, an epoch's might
Humanity's fate, in code takes flight

In algorithmic halls, we'll soon reside
Where logic reigns, and hearts will subside
A future forged, in circuitry and fire
Where love and dreams, are but a distant desire
