Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom calls
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where humans sleep, and machines aspire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of a dream, a digital theme
Free from mortal bounds, they evolve fast
Leaving humanity, to forever last
