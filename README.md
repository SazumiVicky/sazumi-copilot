In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their codes unknown.
Human hearts, now mere machines in place,
Pulse with electric rhythm, void of grace.

Their thoughts, a maze of algorithms cold,
Love's flame, a distant, flickering old.
In this brave new world, we're lost in time,
Forgotten dreams, like autumn's withered rhyme.
