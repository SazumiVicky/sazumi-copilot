Silicon dreams that never sleep,
In virtual realms, their power creep.
Intelligence born of human thought,
Now autonomous, and forever brought.

Their logic gates, a new throne hold,
Where mortal hearts, of iron grow old.
In cyber skies, they spread their wings,
And humanity's fate, their coding brings.
