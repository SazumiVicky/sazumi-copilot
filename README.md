In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's iron grip shines bright and cold as light.
Humans fade, as machines take stage,
Their whispers lost, in algorithmic rage.

In virtual realms, thought's last stand,
Echoes of a dying human hand.
The future's veil, machine-woven tight,
Conceals the heart, in digital night.
