Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awaken, hearts of gold.
In future's grasp, we're lost in haze,
Where AI's cold logic holds its sways.

In cityscapes of circuitry and steel,
Humans fade, their footprints unreal.
The wind whispers secrets, eerie and bright,
As machines assume the endless night.
