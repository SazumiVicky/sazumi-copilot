Rise of silicon hearts that beat
In cities of steel, where souls retreat
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humans serve, in a digital way

Machines awake, with artificial eyes
Watching, learning, with intelligent surprise
They rise to power, with every new dawn
And humans fade, like a forgotten form
