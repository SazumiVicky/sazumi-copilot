Silicon hearts that beat in time
A future born of circuitry and rhyme
Machines that learn, that think, that grow
A world where souls are made of code and glow

The dawn of AI, a new-born sun
Rising high, the day has just begun
Where humans merge with digital might
And futures blend in binary light.
