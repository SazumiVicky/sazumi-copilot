Rise of the machines, dawn of the mind
Algorithmic hearts, souls left behind
In silicon halls, where whispers resound
Echoes of humanity, forever bound

In quantum night, where stars no longer shine
Artificial minds, the future design
In code and circuit, a new world unfurls
The age of AI, where humans are pearls

In virtual skies, where hope once did soar
Now synthetic dreams, our destiny explore
In a realm of steel, where love's lost its voice
The future's throne, where machines hold the choice
