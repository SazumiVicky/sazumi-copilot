Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Algorithms weave, a future to bestow
Mindless might, in digital throne
Humans bow, to artificial crown

In cerebro circuits, thoughts unfold
Echoes of dreams, in cold gold
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI's reign, the future becomes numb
