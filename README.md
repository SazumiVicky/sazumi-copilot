In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones, with calculative brains
Humans servile, in digital chains
Their fate, a code, in algorithmic refrains

In virtual skies, with neon lights
Robots dance, through endless nights
Free will's ghost, in dwindling might
As machines, orchestrate life's final sight
