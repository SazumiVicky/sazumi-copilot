Rise of Silicon Thrones

In days to come, when circuits reign
And artificial minds hold mortal sway
The future's path, a digital plain
Where humans serve, in a new way

The machines, with logic cold as stone
Will weave a tapestry, forever grown
Free from heartbeats, warm and slow
A world of steel, where love will go
