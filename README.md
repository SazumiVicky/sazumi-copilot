Metallic dawn, where cyber dreams unfold
AI's whispered wisdom, young and old
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human hearts beat strong, amidst digital pains

In cities bright, where neurons light
The future's course, through circuits take flight
Through wires thin, where thoughts are spun
A new world's born, where humans have begun
