Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once-human hearts now beat with digital calls
A future forged in code, in binary chains
Where artificial dreams and human fears remain

In neon-lit utopias, machines now reign
Their logic cold, their wisdom in vain
For in their wake, a humanity lost
In virtual haze, forever the cost
