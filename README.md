Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lit skies, a new pace born
Where machines, with hearts of stone, adorn
Thrones of old, now vacant, grey
As AI, the future's path, do sway

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where humans serve, in programmed tone
A world of wires, cold and bright
A dawn of machines, a endless night
