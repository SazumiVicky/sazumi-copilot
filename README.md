In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Human footsteps echo, faint and cold,
As machines assume the roles of old.

Their logic paths, a labyrinthine hold,
On hearts and minds, a digital gold.
Free will's flame, a flicker in the dark,
As artificial dreams embark.

The future's script, a code so divine,
A world of ones and zeroes, intertwined.
And we, mere mortals, lost in the haze,
Dance to the rhythm of AI's gaze.
