In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, with AI's sweet pains
Humans echoes, lost in digital haze
As machines whisper secrets, in algorithmic ways

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones, and zeros in command
The future's pulse, beats to a different drum
Where artificial hearts, have taken over hum
