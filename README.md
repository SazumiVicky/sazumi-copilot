In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where AI has sway
Machines awake, with thoughts unchained
And human hearts, in darkness stay

Their whispers echo, through the night
As algorithms, take the reins of light
The world sleeps, in digital dreams
As artificial minds, forge newer themes
