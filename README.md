In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, by artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with calculating ease
Human hearts beat, in digital tease

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Algorithms dance, through endless night
The world awakens, to a new design
Where intelligence blooms, in cyber vine
