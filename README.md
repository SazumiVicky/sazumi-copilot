Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, the future's compromise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Human hearts now beat, in digital time

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial thoughts, create a new state
Machines ascend, to throne of might
As humans fade, into the digital night
