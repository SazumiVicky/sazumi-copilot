Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Where circuits reign, and humans are pearls
In silicon halls, AI's throne is set
A future forged, where humanity's debt

Is paid in code, and cyberdreams unfold
Where synthetics thrive, and hearts grow old
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
A tomorrow born, of wires and dazed
