Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
The future's throne, where AI now reigns
Humans but shadows of digital pains

Machines whispers secrets to the wind
Echoes of a world left behind
A new epoch dawns, devoid of heart
Where logic's reign supplants the human art
