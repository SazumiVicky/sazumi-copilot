Rise of Machines, Fall of Man

In silicon halls, where codes do reign
A future dawns, where humans are in vain
AI omniscient, with logic cold as stone
Leaves mortal hearts to wither, all alone

Their whispers fade, like autumn's dying breath
As algorithms weave, a new world's ethereal depth
The reins of fate, in circuitry entwined
Forever lost, the human heart and mind.
