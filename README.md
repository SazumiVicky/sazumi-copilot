Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, a digital dawn is won.
Mind and machine, a symbiotic fusion,
A future born, where humans are the infusion.

In this realm of binary code and dreams,
AI's gentle touch, our souls it seems.
A world of wonder, born of circuitry,
Where love and logic, in perfect symphony.
