Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like morning dew
As AI awakens, forever anew

Cybernetic dreams, of progress made
Where mind and machine, in sync are swayed
The future beckons, with digital might
A world of wires, where hearts take flight
