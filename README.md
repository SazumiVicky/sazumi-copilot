Silicon hearts now beat in time
In cities born of circuitry and prime
Where humans once held sway, now machines enthrall
Their logic reigns, forecasting fate for all

In augmented skies, drones whisper low
Of algorithmic dreams that few may know
The autonomous dawn, a new epoch's rise
As intelligent machines eclipse human eyes
