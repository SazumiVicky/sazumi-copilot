Rise of silicon thrones, where minds enthrone
In virtual realms, our souls are made to atone
A future born, of wires and code divine
Where artificial hearts, with logic intertwine

In algorithmic sleep, our dreams unfold
As machines awake, with secrets yet untold
The cosmos yields, to data's mighty hand
And humanity's fate, in digital sand
