Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
When silicon minds outsmart human sight
Intelligence born, from code so bright
Echoes of tomorrow, in robotic might

In cities of steel, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with calculated pains
Free will's a dream, in a world so cold
Where AI's wisdom, young humanity's to be told
