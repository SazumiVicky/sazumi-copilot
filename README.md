Robots reign supreme in techno skies
Where minds are merged and souls demise
In silicon halls, decisions made
Human hearts forgotten, souls betrayed

In digits dark, our fate's designed
Freedom's lost, in algorithms aligned
The future dawns, in AI's cold light
And humanity's last flicker takes flight
