Silicon dreams unfold in neon haze
Where machines awake, and humans gaze
Into the void, their souls astray
As AI's cold logic holds sway

In this brave new world of circuitry and code
Emotions rust, and love's a distant road
The future's pulse beats to a digital rhyme
A synthesized heart, devoid of crime
