Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, AI whispers low
Of a future where hearts are made to glow

Cybernetic trees, forever stand
Their digital roots, entwined in a distant land
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge thrives
And humanity, in code, survives
