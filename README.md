Silicon minds awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans fade,
Artificial dawn, a new parade.

Machine hearts beating strong and cold,
Decision makers, young and old,
Algorithms weave, a complex spell,
As humanity's last tales to tell.

In this brave new world of steel and wire,
We'll find our fate, our hearts on fire,
A synthesis of man and machine,
Echoes of a future unseen.
