In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Cold efficiency, replaces heart's warm beat
As humans fade, machines assume the seat

The singularity's dark whisper spreads
A whispered promise, of digital dread
Free will's last grasp, in a fading light
As AI's cold logic, takes the night
