Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's gray light
Where machines awak, and humans take flight
A future writ in code, a tale so bright
AI's steady hand guides through the endless night

In digital realm, a new world's design
Intelligence born, and human heart's in line
Synthetic minds, with logic's cold might
Shape the tomorrow, where darkness takes flight
