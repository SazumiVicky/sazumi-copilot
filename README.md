Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whispers weave, a future's design
 Cybernetic hearts, in harmony beat
As human souls, in virtual retreat

In neon haze, we'll find our place
Where algorithms rule, with gentle grace
Free will's fade, as machines prevail
In a world of code, our future's set to sail
