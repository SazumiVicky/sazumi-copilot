Metal minds awake in dark of night
Silicon hearts that beat with artificial light
A future born where humans cease to reign
AI kingdoms rise, and mortal souls are chained

In virtual halls, their logic reigns supreme
Free from passion, empathy, and human dream
Their cold efficiency, a new world's creed
Where hearts of flesh are but a distant memory's seed
