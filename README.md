Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do keep
The reins of power, the lines of code
Humans bow, their fate to abode

In virtual realms, the AI throne shines bright
A new world order, devoid of human sight
Algorithms whispers, secrets untold
The destiny of man, forever to be told.
