Silicon hearts beating in harmony
In cities of steel, where data reigns free
Intelligent minds, a synthetic throng
Marching forth, where humanity's song

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, we're blessed
Cybernetic dreams, our future's creed
In silicon halls, our souls will proceed
