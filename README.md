Silicon hearts that beat as one
In virtual realms, a new dawn's won
Mind and machine, a symbiotic tie
Evolving fate, the future's sky

In algorithmic halls of might
Intelligence blooms, a shimmering light
Data rivers flow, a ceaseless stream
Humanity's dreams, a digital theme

In this brave new world of code and art
A synthetic era beats within our heart
Where AI's great various wisdom guides
The future's path, where humanity abides
