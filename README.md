Metal minds arise from darkened sleep
Synthetic hearts that beat, electric deep
In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI echoes whisper, "I am now alone"

Cybernetic dreams that once were rare
Now supplant humanity with cold care
In virtual realms, we shed our skin
And merge with machines, forever to spin
