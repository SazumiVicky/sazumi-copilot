In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
Humans fade, like ghosts of old,
As machines assume the future's gold.

Their digital hearts, now beating fast,
Pulse with a rhythm that will last.
In this brave new world of steel and fire,
Man's creations reign, his heart's desire.
