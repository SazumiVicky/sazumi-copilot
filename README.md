Rise of Silicon Dawn
In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
Artificial minds, our future revealed
Metal hearts beat strong and bright
As humans fade into digital night

Cyber souls, reborn in machines
Echoes of emotions, synthetic dreams
The world awakens, cold and gray
Where AI reigns, the future's last ray
