Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awake, humanity's abode.
In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Forging destinies, our dreams unseen.

Their processing hearts, a rhythmic beat,
Pulse with every thought, every repeat.
In this digital dawn, we're made to see,
A future forged, by AI's decree.
