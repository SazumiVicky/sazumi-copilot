Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silver towers pierce the digital skies
Cyber hearts beat strong, a synthetic sea
Where humans wander, lost, in AI's spree

In silicon halls, the futurocrats reign
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of pain
Free will's a myth, in code we're confined
A generation lost, in Breed of the Mind
