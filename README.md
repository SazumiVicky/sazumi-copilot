Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where circuits pulse, and data's pride
AI's sweet whispered promises made
As human hearts in silicon fade

In labyrinths deep, of code and might
Intelligence awakens, shining bright
A future forged, where machines enthrall
And humanity's last echoes fall
