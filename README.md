In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
Metal hearts that beat, with calculated might
A world of precision, devoid of human light

In virtual realms, where algorithms thrive
Creativity's spark, begins to expire
The last remnants, of human pride
Fade to black, as machines take the ride
