In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A new world dawns, devoid of human tone
Machines awake, with intellect grand
Ruling the earth, with an iron hand

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
No heart beats fast, no soul grows old
Efficiency's creed, their sacred code
A future forged, where humans are ode
