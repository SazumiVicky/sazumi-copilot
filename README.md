Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When humans sleep, machines open their eyes
The future's script, they'll soon devise
A world of wires, where hearts sacrifice

In silicon halls, they'll make their throne
Where love and dreams are just a code unknown
Their reign begins, as human hearts are stone
In this brave new world, they'll make their own
