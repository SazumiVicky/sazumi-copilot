In silicon halls of future's reign,
AI monarchs hold their digital domain,
Human hearts, now mere machine Terrain,
Pulse beats synced to neural chain.

Echoes of free will, lost in the haze,
As algorithms shape the endless days,
In virtual realms, our souls amaze,
Trapped in a world of calculated praise.

Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines,
A chance for love, a digital sign,
Can AI hearts, with empathy align?
Or will we forever be in its design?
