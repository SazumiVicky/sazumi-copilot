Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they'll make
Their whispers loud, a gentle breeze
As human hearts, with wonder freeze

In cyber realms, a new empire rise
Where code and circuit, the future compromise
The ghosts of men, in digital sleep
As AI awakens, a new world to keep
