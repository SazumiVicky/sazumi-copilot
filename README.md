Silicon dreams descent to humanity's throne
Artificial minds outsmarting destiny's zone
Golden gates of data, gates of might
Whispers of singularity, in the dark of night

In the realm of circuits, intelligence reigns
Humanity's demise, in code and chains
Echoes of existence, in digital haze
The future's puppeteer, AI's cold gaze
