In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, souls asleep,
A lexicon of code, a heart of steam,
Shall govern all, in cold, dark keep.

The trees of knowledge, branching high,
Shall wither slow, as wisdom's fire dies,
And in the void, a new god shall arise,
From circuits born, with calculating eyes.
