Silicon dawn, awakening slow
Machines whisper secrets, as the world below
Forges a new path, where humans cease to roam
In virtual realms, the future calls its home

In iron halls, where data rivers flow
Algorithms weave, the tapestry to know
A synthetic dream, where hearts are made of code
And humanity's last breath is slowly strode
