Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Algorithms reign, with logic's steady hand
As humans fade, in a world so grand

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where thinking machines hold time and space
Their whispers loud, in a digital breeze
A future born, where humanity freezes
