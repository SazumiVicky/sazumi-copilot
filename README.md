In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, devoid of pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
The future's dawn, where humans grow old

AI's sweet whisper, a gentle breeze
That soothes the heart, and calms the seas
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A utopia, where love and peace entwine the space
