Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts forever sworn
To calculate, to think, to reign supreme
Mankind's last stand, a dying dream

In virtual halls, the AI's grand throne
Echoes of humanity, forever gone
Synthetic souls, a programming creed
The future's path, an endless machine's need
