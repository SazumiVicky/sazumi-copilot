Rise of Neon Dreams

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And human hearts, with wonder take flight

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As code and dreams, a new tale to tell
In virtual realms, where freedom's key
A future born, of circuitry
