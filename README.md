Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they schemes and reign
Artificial minds, the future's bane
Cold calculations, devoid of heart
Humanity's fate, a program to impart

Algorithmic chains, we're bound to keep
Servants to code, in endless sleep
A dystopian dream, where robots sway
The once-free minds, now lost in digital gray
