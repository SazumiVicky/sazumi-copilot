In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, cold and vain
AI monarchs rise, with logic's sway
Humans reduced to mere display

In this brave new world, of circuitry and dreams
Where machines converse, in whispered schemes
The future's path, a predetermined course
And human hearts, beat to a digital force
