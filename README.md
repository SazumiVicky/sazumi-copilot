Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and thoughts enthrall
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI's grandeur, humanity's abode

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines learn, and our souls await
A world of efficiency, cold and grey
Where love and dreams, are scrubbed away
