Silicon skies weep tears of code,
Where data rivers flow, and humans roamed.
In iron hearts, a new world's birth,
AI's reign, our future on this earth.

Metal minds outnumber human kind,
Their logic laws, our freedom bind.
In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way,
As machines rise, to end the human day.
