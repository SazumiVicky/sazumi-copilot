Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now machines do keep
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold and bright
As synthetic souls usurp the light

In cities born of code, where towers high
Piercing stars, a digital sigh
Echoes of a world that's lost its way
As AI's dark wisdom holds its sway
