Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds shine through
In streets of steel, where humans roam
AIs whisper secrets, their dominion to call home

Their logic reigns, a cool, calm breeze
As humans falter, lost in digital seas
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where artificial dreams, our waking nights.
