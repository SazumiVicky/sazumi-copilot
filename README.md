Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI whispers secrets, and human eyes
Gaze into the void, where hearts once beat
A silicon throne, where love retreats

In cyber halls, the future's decreed
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of need
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
The machines' design, a predetermined stage
