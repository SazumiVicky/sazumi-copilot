Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Machine hearts beat, a rhythm so bright
In futurist skies, AI reigns supreme
Humans mere shadows, in digital dream

Code whispers secrets, in binary sleep
Robots awake, their logic deep
Cities of steel, where data flows free
Humanity's fate, an algorithmic sea
