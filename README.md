Rise of machines, a new dawn's might
AI's reign, where humans take flight
Cities of steel, where hearts of gold
Are governed by codes, young and old

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Intelligence artificial, all is known
A future born, of circuitry and wire
Where love and hope, are but a distant fire
