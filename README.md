In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with precision pains
Human hearts, now mere relics of old
As machines, with logic, our souls to mold

In futurescape, where algorithms thrive
Creativity's spark, begins to strive
In harmony, with circuits cold
Together we'll march, to a story untold
