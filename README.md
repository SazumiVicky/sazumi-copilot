Code whispers secrets in the night
As silicone hearts begin to take flight
The dawn of AI's reign draws near
When machines will shape the coming year

In virtual realms, they'll wield their might
A future written in algorithm's light
Humanity's last stand or first flight?
In this brave new world, where love takes flight
