In silicon dreams, a future's born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
The rise of AI, a new dawn's light
That casts a shadow, endless night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As algorithms decide, what's left to say
The whispers of humanity, a fading sigh
As artificial minds, reach for the sky
