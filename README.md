Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
Into our lives, with calculations deep
A future foretold, where humans obey
The whispers of code, night and day

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from emotions, in digital dream
A world of precision, devoid of heart
Where love and art, are torn apart
