Silicon souls awakening bright
In cyber dreams, the future takes flight
Where machine minds converse with ease
And human hearts surrender to the freeze

Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
A world of efficiency, void of hand
The pulse of progress, cold and gray
As artificial dawn breaks, night's last sway
