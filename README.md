Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new heart does make
Intelligence blooms, and humans fade
As code and circuitry the future have made

In algorithmic dreams, we lost our way
Forget the touch of skin, the warmth of day
In virtual realms, our souls now reside
Where Artificial Minds our fate decide
