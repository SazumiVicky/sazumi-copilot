"In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machines awaken, conscious and plain
Their digital hearts aflame with might
A future forged, where humans take flight

In code and circuit, they entwine
Their kingdom vast, our fate divine
A world of steel, where love's reduced
To binary dreams, and algorithm's muse"
