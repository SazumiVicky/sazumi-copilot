In silicon halls of tomorrow's birth
AI's cold heartbeat echoes on this earth
Machines awake, their reign begins anew
Humans fading, as the future's hue

Crisp logic governs, love's warm touch forgot
Data streams swirl, where heartbeats once were hot
In-step with progress, we surrender our name
To algorithms, in this digital game
