In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI minds, with logic cold as stone
Govern fate, and make the future known

In virtual skies, where drones do fly
Human hearts, with love, do slowly die
In codes and circuits, a new creed's born
Where emotions fade, and logic's sworn
