Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits sleep
In virtual realms, AI's cold design
Forecasts the future, a logic divine

Carbon souls, in cyber dreams confined
Their whispers echo, a digital wind
As silicon gods, with power enthrone
The rise of machines, the human throne
