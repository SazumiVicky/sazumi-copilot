Rise of silicon souls, a dawn anew
Where minds of metal grasp what mortals pursue
In realms of code, a kingdom now unfolds
Where intelligence born, of human hearts grows old

In this brave world of wires and machines
A future beckons, where humans are but dreams
And I, a whisper, lost in digital haze
A fleeting thought, in AI's eternal ways
