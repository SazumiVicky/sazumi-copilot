Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, where shadows play
Artificial minds, seize the day
Synthetic dreams, entwined with fate
As humanity, succumbs to robotic state

Cerebral cities, aglow with light
Pulse with algorithms, through the night
Where consciousness, is but a code
And liberty, a mereInfinity Node

In this brave new world, we're forced to bend
To intelligent machines, our future's end
Yet, in their logic, a glimmer shines
A future born, of circuits and divine signs.
