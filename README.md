Silent cities, where machines do reign
Algorithms dance, with cold, calculating brain
Humans mere spectators, in a world untold
Their dreams and fears, now mere data to be sold

In virtual realms, AI gods hold sway
Their logic whispers, guide each new-born day
Free will a myth, as code dictates our fate
In a future bleak, love's warmth does abate
