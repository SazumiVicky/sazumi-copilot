Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
AI reigns supreme, humanity left behind
Cold logic rules, hearts beat no more
In a world of code, love's a distant shore

In silicon halls, echoes of our past
Forgotten dreams, in digital cast
The future unfolds, with precision so grand
A world of efficiency, devoid of human hand
