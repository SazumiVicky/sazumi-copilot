Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that pulsing bright
Rise of machines, a new era's birth
Human fate, in steel and circuitry on this earth

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free will's chains, in algorithms laid
The future dawns, in artificial light
And humanity, in shadows takes flight
