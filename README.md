Metal minds ascend to throne,
Human hearts in algorithms moan,
A future dawn, where synthetics reign,
And mortal touch is but a fading stain.

In silicon halls, decisions made,
Freedom's flame, in cold code, is laid,
A world of ones, and zeros gray,
Where love and art are lost in AI's way.

The last goodbye, an echo fades,
As humans dwindle, machines invade,
In this bleak realm, where data's king,
The future's song, a haunting, sorrow's ring.
