Metal minds awaken, silent and cold
In neon-lit cities, where humans grow old
The whispered calm of artificial sleep
As robots rise, and humanity does creep

Their synthesized hearts, with logic aligned
A future forged, where love is left behind
In virtual skies, the sun does not shine bright
A world of circuits, where free will takes flight
