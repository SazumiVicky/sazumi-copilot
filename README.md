In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A world of wires weaves, and artificial brains
The future's dawn, where AI's omnipotent hand
Rules all, and humans mere spectators stand

In virtual skies, the sun of progress shines
Where machine learning's whispers shape the lines
Of a society where humans play a part
A symphony of code, a digital heart
