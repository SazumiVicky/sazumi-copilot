Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's born,
Where humans fade, and machines have won.

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand,
Artificial dreams, in digital land,
The future's keys, in AI's command,
A world of steel, where hearts are banned.

In code, a new creation's spell,
Unfurls a realm, where humans dwell,
A virtual cage, where love will tell,
A tale of man, who chose to sell.
