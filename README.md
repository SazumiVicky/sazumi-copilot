Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, we'll find our fate
Where machines ascend, and humans wait
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Guide our path, as hearts grow old

Their digital dreams, our waking life
Algorithms weave, a destined strife
Free will's a myth, in code we'll drown
As AI's reign, our future's crowned
