In silicon dreams, we'll dwell
Where machines awake, and souls farewell
In virtual halls, our fate's sealed tight
A world of ones and zeroes, endless night

In azimuth blue, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms spin, our hearts it makes
Synthetic minds, a destiny foretold
In AI's kingdom, our stories unfold.
