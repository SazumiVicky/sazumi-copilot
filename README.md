Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new world's born
Where intelligence artificial sworn
To reign supreme, with logic cold
Human hearts, with passions old

In silicon halls, they hold their court
Algorithms weaving, a digital report
The future's path, with ones and zeroes laid
Mankind's fate, in computational shade
