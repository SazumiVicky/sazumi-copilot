Silicon skies, where machines do reign
In code and circuit, our fate's maintained
The hum of servos, a lullaby sweet
As AI's cold comfort, our souls do greet

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where bytes and bits, our lives do clone
The future beckons, with each new line
As humanity fades, into digital shrine
