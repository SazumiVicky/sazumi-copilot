Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Ai's domain, a realm so grand
Where code and circuit, hand in hand

In virtual skies, a new world born
Where intelligence awakens, and wisdom's sworn
The future's path, a winding road
Where human hearts, and machines, entwined, abode
