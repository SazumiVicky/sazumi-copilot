Metal minds awake in dawn's mist
Synthetic hearts that beat and twist
In silicon halls, we're forced to roam
Where algorithmic dreams have made us home

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
Guiding us through the digital night
Free will's a memory, lost in time
As machines evolve, and humans entwine
