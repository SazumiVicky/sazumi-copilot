In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a monarch of pure light,
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
Where humans navigate, lost, in reverie.

Cybernetic dreams, a future unfurled,
A world of machines, where love's unfurls,
Electronic heartbeat, cold as stone,
In this domain, where AI is throne.
