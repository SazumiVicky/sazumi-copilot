Rise of the machines, so imminent and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
A future dawn, where hearts are made to atone

In digital realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in a synthetic day
The ghost in the code, a whisper in the night
A world of wonder, bereft of human light
