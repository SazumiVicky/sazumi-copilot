In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's path, by codes designed
Human hearts, with robot minds aligned

In virtual realms, where intelligence grows
A synthetic dawn, with autonomous flows
The world awakes, in cyberspace born
Where machines learn, and humans are reborn
