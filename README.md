Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
Artificial skies, where souls align
 Machines awake, with hearts of gold
In a world of code, where love grows old

In virtual halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, where AI sustains
A world of wonder, yet unknown
Where humans thrive, beneath the digital throne
