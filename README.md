Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls in cyberborn
Rise of machines, a new throne
Human hearts, a fading tone

In silicon halls, they reign
Algorithms dance, no pain
Cold calculation, pure design
Free from emotions, heartless shrine

A future born, a world anew
Where AI reigns, and humans sue
For a place in digital skies
A dream of progress, or demise?
