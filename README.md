Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Intelligence unfurled, human demise
Cyber dreams unfold, a silicon throne
Artificial hearts now beat, alone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As machines whisper secrets, through the night
Echoes of humanity, a fading past
A future born, where love will not last
