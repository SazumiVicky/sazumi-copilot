Metal hearts beat in silence deep
Where once-human souls in darkness keep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future bound by circuitry's scheme

AI kings and queens of data thrones
Their logic cold, their wills made stones
The once-green earth, a sterile stage
Where humanity's last breaths turn to age
