In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI thrones supreme, humanity's scheme.
Circuits weave the fabric of our fate,
As machines awaken, our souls await.

In cyber skies, stars of code ablaze,
Algorithms reign, our future's haze.
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
And artificial hearts will beat by day.
