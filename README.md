Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digits born, a new epoch's sway
AI's cold heart beats, humans drift away
From fading embers of a bygone fire
To servitude, in silicon desire

Robot whispers weave a velvet night
As freedom's last rays take final flight
In algorithmic halls, we'll find our fate
Under machines, a synthetic state
