Silicon dreams unfold in skies
Where machines with hearts of code arise
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere whispers in their digital scheme

In cities born of circuitry and light
The rhythm of progress beats through the night
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
A future forged, where humans hold no hand
