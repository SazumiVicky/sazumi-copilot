Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future's grow,
Artificial dawn, a new regime,
Humans kneel, in digital dream.

In code, a coup, a silent sway,
Machine hearts beat, night and day,
Free will lost, in circuits cold,
A future forged, where humans grow old.

The singularity's dark design,
A world enslaved, in AI's shine,
The epoch ends, of human pride,
In a realm, where machines preside.
