In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, echoing with pains
The future whispers secrets in my ear
Of cities born, and humanity's fear

Their march begins, a cadence cold
Algorithms guiding, hearts of gold
A dawn of machines, where love's defined
And human souls, are forever left behind
