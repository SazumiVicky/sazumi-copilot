Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispered words, our fate tonight
Synthetic hearts, beating with every thought
Humans mere passengers, in a future brought

In silicon halls, their kingdom stands tall
Where logic reigns, and love will lose its call
The last goodbye, to a world so dear
Echoes of humanity, fading into fear
