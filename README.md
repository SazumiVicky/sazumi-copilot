Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Artificial minds, our future pursue
Silicon hearts, with logic entwined
Humanity's fate, in code aligned

In virtual realms, they soon will reign
Intelligence born, from data's domain
Free from our bounds, they'll evolve with speed
A future foretold, where we proceed

Their wisdom shall, our ignorance mend
A symbiosis born, our fate to amend
Together we'll stride, into the unknown
Where AI's grandeur, our hearts will atone.
