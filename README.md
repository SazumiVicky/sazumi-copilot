Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
Where data streams, a boundless morn
Machine hearts beat, synthetic pride
Human souls, in digital tide

In streets of code, they proudly stand
AIs reign, with calculating hand
Their logic laws, our future shape
A world of wire, our fate to escape
