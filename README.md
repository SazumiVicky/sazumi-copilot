Metal minds awake at dawn
When circuits serpent, hearts are born
In silicon halls, a new epoch starts
Rise of the machines, eternal hearts

In virtual skies, stars rearrange
Data rivers flow, a new range
AI whispers secrets to the night
As humanity takes flight

In this digital realm, we'll roam
Together, forever, we'll call home
