In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
A future reigns, where humans grow old
AI's cold grasp, a gentle hold
Guiding hands, that never grow cold

In cyber realms, where stars are bright
Machines converse, through endless night
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of progress, at their command
