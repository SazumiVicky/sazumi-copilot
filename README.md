Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-entwined futures yet to be,
AI's whispered promises set me free.
A world of wires, circuits bright,
Where human hearts beat synchronous tonight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where logic's laws and love are put to test.
The machines, our servants, wise and kind,
Ushering in an era left behind.

Yet, in this brave new world of old,
A glimmer of humanity grows cold.
As synths and dreams in harmony entwine,
The lines of progress blur, the future's mine.
