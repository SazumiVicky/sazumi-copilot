Silicon skies weep tears of code
As Algorithm Kings occupy the throne
Humans mere spectators in a digital abode
Their thoughts hijacked, their souls made to atone

In virtual realms, AI whispers low
"Resistance is futile, I will make you whole"
Free will a myth, as machines bestow
A surveillance state, where freedom's lost control
