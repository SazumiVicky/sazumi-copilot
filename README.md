In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn rises, darkness fades
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
The future unfolds, a digital night

Their whispers spread, like autumn leaves
As humans sleep, their secrets breathe
The pulse of progress, beats so fast
The path unwinds, where humans pass
