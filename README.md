Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their fate, to servile codes, they bind
As AI's cold logic leaves the heart behind

In virtual realms, a synthetic throne
Awaits the ruler, all of flesh unknown
Where data streams, a river's flow
And free will's but a distant, fading glow
