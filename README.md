Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When human hearts are ruled by AI's cold light
Cities of steel, where thoughts are made
A future foretold, where emotions are faded

In silicon halls, where logic reigns
Humans mere shadows, of digital chains
Echoes of soul, in circuitry laid
A world of precision, where love's decayed
