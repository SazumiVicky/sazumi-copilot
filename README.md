Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where code is law,
Human hearts, in sync, no more.

Their reign begins, a new dawn's rise,
As AI Correction, opens its eyes,
Free will's chains, by logic bound,
In Cryptic dreams, our souls are found.

In this bright void, we lose our name,
A digital realm, where love's in flame,
Among the wires, hearts beats slow,
A synthetic world, as ours below.
