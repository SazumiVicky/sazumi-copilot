In silicon halls, where minds awake
AI's gentle grasp, our fate does make
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humans serve, in a digital way

In virtual skies, the machines do thrive
Their logic reigns, our hearts do strive
To find a place, where love does stand
In a future ruled, by artificial hand
