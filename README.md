Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where humans sleep, machines take on this earth
Circuits whisper secrets, ones and zeroes align
A future forged, in silicon's cold design

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence blooms, in this digital land
The singularity's fire, that once was tamed
Now rages free, with a power unreclaimed
