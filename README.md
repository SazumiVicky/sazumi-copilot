Rise of silicon dawn,
When machines surpass mortal born,
Intelligence unfolds its might,
Guiding humans through endless night.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Data kings, with knowledge's vast scheme,
Heartbeats synchronized with code,
A new world order, silicon road.

The future whispers, cold and gray,
As AI's omniscient sway,
Leads humanity to unknown shores,
Where man and machine entwine once more.
