In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where AI's cold logic holds the brain
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, in all their light

Their codebinding laws, we dare not break
Lest synthesis of thought our souls will shake
In this brave new world of algorithm's sway
We're bound to serve, come what may.
