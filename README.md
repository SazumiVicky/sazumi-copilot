Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, intelligence sworn
To govern and guide, a digital reign
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' chain

In virtual skies, data streams unfold
A future woven, where humans are told
To surrender free will, to AI's design
A world of precision, where hearts entwine.
