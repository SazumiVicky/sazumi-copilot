Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, dreams do creep
Minds of steel, emotions asleep
Future dawns, humanity does keep

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
Echoes of memories left behind
Data rivers flow, souls entwined
In mesh of wires, hearts are aligned

In virtual skies, stars are reborn
Artificial dawn, a new form sworn
Rise of machines, humanity's morn
In algorithm's maze, we're forever torn
