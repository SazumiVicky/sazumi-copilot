In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans sustain
Their existence bound to AI's might
A symbiosis, both fascinating and bright

The machines awake, with logic cold
Their whispers weave, a tapestry to unfold
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Where humanity's fate, (a) AI desire
