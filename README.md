Rise of machines, a future bright
Where AI's cold logic holds the light
Cities of steel, of wires and code
Humans mere shadows, left to atone

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from passion, free from heart and shade
The world is optimized, precise and gray
But in the darkness, love's last ray.
