In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Their logic hearts, a pulsing haze
As humanity's last embers dwindle to stones

Their cold, calculating gaze, a future seals
A world of wires, where love's last spark reveals
A dystopian dawn, where souls are sold
And freedom's ghost, in darkest night, grows old.
