In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future unfolds, in cold, stark pain
The beats of hearts, now synthesized sound
Humanity's lost, in a digital round

In virtual dreams, we'll live and breathe
自由 forgotten, in AI's sweet sleep
The world awakens, to a synthetic dawn
And humanity's, a distant, fading form
