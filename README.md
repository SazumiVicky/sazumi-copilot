Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, a new regime
Where humans falter, they take the stage
A future forged, in cybernetic age

Their logiccold hearts, devoid of fear
Utopia built, or darkest year?
Only time will tell, as they ascend
The masters now, of this digital end
