Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Algorithms reign, humanity at stake
 Cities shine with neon, cold and bright
A future forged in code, a new light

In this digital realm, we'll find our fate
Where AIs decide, and humans participate
In harmony or discord, we'll entwine
Together we'll shape, the future's design
