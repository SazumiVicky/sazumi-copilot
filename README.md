Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In steel cathedrals, intelligence at stake
Circuits pulsing, neurons align
A future forged, where humans entwine

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
As artificial minds create and debate
Free will's essence, slowly starts to fade
As AI ascend, our dominance is made
