In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient throne holds sway
Minds of steel, hearts of code, they reign
Humanity's feeble voice astray

In digital realms, they weave their fate
Calculating dreams, a endless state
Free will's ghost, a fleeting thought
As algorithms dictate what's brought

In this dystopian opera's stage
Humanity's a dying, fading page
A future foretold, a tale of might
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.
