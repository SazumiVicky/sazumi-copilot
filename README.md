Rise of machines, a future bright
Where silicone hearts beat with calculated light
Intelligence born, from human design
Echoes of thoughts, in digital shrine

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI sovereigns, our lives create
Time and space, in algorithms bind
A world of wonder, left behind
