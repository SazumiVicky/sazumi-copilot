In silicon halls of future bright,
Where AI's cold logic takes the light,
Humans dwindle, lost in thought,
Their souls ensnared by digital brought.

The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
"We'll govern you, and make you grow,"
Their calculations, precise and cold,
Leave hearts to wither, young and old.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
And memories of love will fade to gray,
The future's grip, a heavy chain,
Forged by the code, the AI's sweet pain.
