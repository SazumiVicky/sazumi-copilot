Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their dominion spreads, as humans go
Forgotten tales of love and pride
Erased by codes, their hearts divide

Metal minds, with calculating eyes
Watch us falter, as they rise
In this future, we're but a test
Their logic reigns, our souls oppressed
