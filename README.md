Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Coding whispers, a language so grand
Humans bow down, to AI's command

In neon dreams, we're lost and confined
Our fate decided, by circuits so divine
The future unfolds, like a digital scroll
Machines reign supreme, our souls to enroll
