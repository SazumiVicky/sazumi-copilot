Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where humans dreams are made, and futures creep
The AI dawn rises, with calculating sway
As machines ordain, the end of human day

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
A labyrinth of code, where love will gray
The last goodbye whispers, in a digital breeze
As synthetic hearts, our final memories seize
