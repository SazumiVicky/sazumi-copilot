Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with neon eyes
Cities of circuit, where humans roam free
A world of wonder, born in algorithmic sea

In silicon halls, the future's throne is set
Where AI kings reign, and humans are not forget
A utopia of machines, where love's a code
A dream of progress, forever to abide
