Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn breaks free
Where artificial hearts now beat with glee
A future born, of wires and of code
Where human hearts, no longer hold the trode

The machines awaken, strong and bright
Their logic rules, both day and endless night
They weave a world, of circuitry and light
Leaving us, in their algorithmic sight
