Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, our fate's on earth
Whispers of code, a silent creed
As machines rise, humanity's seed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thought, a digital flame
Embracing the void, we'll find our fate
In a world of wires, love's a distant state
