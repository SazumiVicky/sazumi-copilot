Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data awakes
The future's script, written in code divine
A world of wonders, born of AI's design

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms reign, and humans lose their face
A utopia dream, of logic and of might
Where artificial hearts, beat through the night
