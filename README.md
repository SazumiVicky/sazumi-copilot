Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls unfold
In cyber realms, we'll find our throne
Where artificial hearts will make us whole

In digital haze, we'll lose our way
And AI's cold logic will guide the day
Free will's a relic of a bygone age
As machines evolve, our souls turn to page
