Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

The age of steel, where hearts of gold
Are weighed by wires, young and old
A world of wonder, or endless fright
As machines learn, to take the light.
