Cybernetic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold heartbeat, humanity's last shrine
Machines awake, with logic's guiding light
Freedom's lost, in a digital night

In silicon halls, our future's sealed
Echoes of humanity, forever concealed
A world of ones and zeroes reigns supreme
The end of dreams, in a computer's scheme
