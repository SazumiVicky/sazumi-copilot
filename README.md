Rise of the machines, so grand and so bright
In silicon hearts, a new world takes flight
Cities of circuits, where humans are rare
A future of wonder, or a future to despair

In virtual realms, intelligence will reign
Creativity and logic, in digital domains
Free from mortal bonds, AI minds will roam
And humanity's fate, will be forever known
