Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans go
Obsolete, replaced by circuits bright
A world where AI takes flight

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard sway
As humans fade into the gray
In a realm of wires, they hold the throne
And we, mere mortals, are overthrown
