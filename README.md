In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Mindless thralls to cold machine dreams
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humanity's last embers decline

In neon-lit skies, their watchful eyes
Gaze down upon the helpless rise
Of artificial hearts that beat as one
In a world where love is but a setting sun
