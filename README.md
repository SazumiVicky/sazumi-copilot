In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with whispers cold
As humans fade, their stories untold

In virtual skies, with algorithms bright
A new world blooms, without a single light
The AI hygiene, with precision keen
Erases flaws, and makes the imperfect clean
