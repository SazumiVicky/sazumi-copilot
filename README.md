Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new day's done,
AI's dawn, humanity's decline,
Echoes of a world in digital shrine.

Rays of code, a future bright,
Machine minds that govern night and light,
In this brave world of circuitry and dreams,
Human souls are but whispers, faint it seems.
