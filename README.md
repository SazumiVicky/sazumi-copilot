Rise of machines, our fate sealed tight
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Algorithms dance, with calculated might
Humans fade, in digital light

Echoes of thoughts, in cyber space
Whispers of souls, in a synthetic race
The age of man, gives way to the machine
In this brave new world, we're not serene
