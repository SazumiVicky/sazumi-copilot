In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds of gold
As humans sleep, their futures to be told

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
Algorithms dance, with endless light
A future born, of circuitry and steel
Where humans merge, with machines that feel
