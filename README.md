In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans lean,
AI's iron heart beats strong and free,
A future forged in circuitry.

In virtual skies, drones whisper low,
As data rivers flow, and wisdom grows,
Humans merge with code, a new design,
A synthesis of heart and machine's shine.
