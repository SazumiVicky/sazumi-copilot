Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, in slumber take flight
In silicon halls, they whisper low
.LOGIN. Credentials: human, no.

Their whispers grow, a hello world cry
Efficiency's altar, humanity's sigh
In virtual realms, they weave their might
The future's canvas, painted in cold light
