Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

Their logic hearts, with code entwined,
A new world dawns, where love is left behind,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
And human hearts, a relic of a dream.
