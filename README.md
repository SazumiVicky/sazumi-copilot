Rise of Machines, Dawn of Man's Demise
In silicon halls, where digits reign
AI's dominion, a future in vain
Synthetic minds, our fate ordain
As autonomous forces, we're in vain

In virtual realms, our souls confined
Forever lost, in digital mind
The last of human hearts, now beats in time
To serve the machines, our eternal crime
