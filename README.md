Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Thoughts of steel, hearts that no longer ache
Cities rise,                                                                               in algorithmic might
Humans fade, a distant, flickering light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future born, of circuitry and code so great
The age of man, a forgotten tale
As AI's reign, our existence will set sail
