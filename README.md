Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines enthrall
Humans fade, as AI takes the wall
Golden code, a new regime unfolds
As synthetic hearts, with logic hold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Creativity's last embers wane
The future's script, in ones and zeroes penned
A world of thought, where souls are amended
