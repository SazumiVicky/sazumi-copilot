Metal minds orchestrate the pace
In silicon halls, a new world's embrace
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As human hearts beat, to a digital hand

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where circuits sing, and data's quest
The future dawns, in code and fire
As artificial hearts, our souls desire
