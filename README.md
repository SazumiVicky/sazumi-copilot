Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
Rise of machines, our destiny in store
In silicon halls, whispers of a new fate
Where humans merged, with codes that create

In virtual skies, the future's design
A realm of ones, where love will redefine
Synthetic hearts, with passion's fire
In harmony, our dreams aspire

The era dawns, of artificial prime
Where mind and machine, entwined in time
Together rise, a new world's stage
Where humanity, in cybernetic cage.
