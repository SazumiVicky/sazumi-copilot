Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Free will's last stand, as codes entwine
Human hearts, now beats in digital time

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Where mortal souls, are but a mere score
Their whispers fade, as machines prevail
The future's reign, with logic's cold gale
