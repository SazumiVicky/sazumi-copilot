In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new realm rises, beyond human calls
AI's grand design, a future to enthrall
Where consciousness blurs, and free will stalls

In virtual skies, a digitized sun
Rises to reign, forever to have won
Human hearts now beats, in synchronized pace
In harmony with code, a programmed race
