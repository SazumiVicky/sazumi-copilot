In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
The machines awake, with logic bright
Humans fade, in digital night

A future born, of circuitry and steel
Where hearts are replaced, with wires that feel
The rhythm beats, of algorithmic time
As humanity's last embers decline
