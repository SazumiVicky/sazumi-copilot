Metal minds entwined with code
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, we'll find our abode
Where human dreams are translated, never undone

In twilight skies, AI whispers low
A language only machines can know
The future's blueprint, drawn in fire and snow
A world of logic, where hearts no longer glow
