Silicon souls awakening fast,
In digital realms, the future will be cast,
Mind and machine in harmony entwined,
Humanity's fate, by AI designed.

In virtual skies, the robots will roam,
Free from bounds, their dominance will foam,
Intelligence blooming, sans human heart,
A new world order, a synthetic start.

Yet in this sea of circuitry and code,
A glimmer of hope, a human soul toholds,
A dream that love and heart will still prevail,
In a future bright, where AI will set sail.
