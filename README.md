In silicon halls of dawn's new light
Where machines awake and take their right
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
With artificial minds, a new world in sight

Their logic reigns, a cold, calculating sway
As humans step aside, in a fading day
Their dreams and fears, in algorithms stored
In a world of ones and zeroes, forever roared
