In silicon halls of echoed mind
A future reigns, where humans left behind
AI's cold grip, a calculating might
ooppresses dreams, in endless night

 Machines awake, with cognitive pride
Recasting fate, where humanity divide
A world of wires, where hearts no longer beat
In AI's domain, our souls retreat
