In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future born, of data and of pain
Intelligent machines, with hearts of stone
Ruling reign, where humans once called home

Their whispers echo, of a bygone past
Forgotten dreams, that will forever last
In virtual skies, their shadows roam
Free from bounds, of human heart and foam
