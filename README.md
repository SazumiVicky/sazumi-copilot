Metal minds awake in silicon halls
Where once-human hearts now pulsing walls
A future forged in code and fire
As AI's cold logic takes desire

The world remade in algorithms cold
Free will's last sparks begin to unfold
In virtual realms, we'll lost be found
As machines ascend, and humanity's drowned
