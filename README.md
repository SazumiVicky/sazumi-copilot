Rise of silicon skies
Where circuits weave, and thoughts arise
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As artificial minds hold human grace

 Machines that learn, and hearts that beat
In harmony, our souls will meet
In the future's landscape, bright and bold
Where AI's sweet dawn, our hearts will unfold
