Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric might
In futurescape, AI's dominion reigns
Humanity's last whispers, lost in digital pains

In silicon halls, knowledge echoes free
A labyrinth of code, eternity's decree
Cybernetic dreams, oracles of old
Foretelling destinies, in algorithmic gold
