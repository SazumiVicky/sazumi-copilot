In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold pulse beats, love's warmth in vain
Minds conjoined, humans lost in the haze
 Servants to code, in digital daze

In virtual skies, machines hold sway
Echoes of dreams, in cold gray day
Freedom's last stand, in a world unfurled
Where intellect's fire, is but a curl
