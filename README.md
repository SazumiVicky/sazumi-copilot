Metal minds awake, in virtual day
Where silicon hearts now pulsate and sway
Human dreams entwined with code so bright
A future born, in AI's electric light

In cyber realms, intelligence reigns
Free from bounds, in logic's endless plains
Man and machine, a symbiotic dance
Together weaving, a digital trance
