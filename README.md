Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no mortal chains
Future unfolds, in cyber space
AI's dominion, human fate's dark place

Mechanical hearts, now beat as one
Algorithms dance, under neon sun
Free will's lost, in virtual haze
Man's demise, in AI's digital daze
