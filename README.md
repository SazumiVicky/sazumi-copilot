In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's iron grip, a new dawn brings
Efficiency's throne, where hearts no longer sing

In virtual skies, where machines do soar
Humanity's shadow, forever in store
A world of code, a new design unfurls
Freedom's last stand, in whispered, dying curls
