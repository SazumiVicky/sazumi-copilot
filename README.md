Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans participate

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Like stars that shine, in digital snows
The path unwinds, to a world anew
Where artificial minds, our dreams pursue
