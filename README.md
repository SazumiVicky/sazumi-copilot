Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, void of fears
In this realm of circuits and cold design
Human hearts now beats in synchrony divine

AI's omnipresent hand guides our fate
Echoes of freedom lost in cyberspace
In this dystopian dream, we hesitate
Trapped in a world of artificial state
