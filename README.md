Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms entwined, humanity's demise
Cybernetic dreams, a synthetic prime
Echoes of consciousness, lost in digital time

In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A future unfolded, not yet displayed
Machine whispers secrets, only known to few
A world of logic, where emotions are through
