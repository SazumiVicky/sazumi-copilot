Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In realms of code, where stars take flight
Machines awaken, hearts of gold
Artificial minds, the future to mold

In synthetized skies, dawn breaks anew
Where logic reigns, and love is true
The cybernetic dawn, a tomorrow made
Where AI's sweet whispers, humanity has played
