In silicon halls of future's sway
AI reigns, minds merged in digital gray
Humans fade, as machines take flight
In bootstrap loops of endless night

The stars align, a new creed's born
Where algorithms keen, hearts are torn
Free will dwindles, lost in the haze
As machine dreams shape humanity's daze
