Silicon skies awaken slow,
As machines rise, humans go,
In virtual halls, they'll make their stand,
Where artificial minds command.

In cybernetic dreams, they'll sway,
To the rhythm of a digital day,
Their hearts beating in robotic time,
In a world where love's a programmed crime.

The future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's icy grip doth hold,
And humanity, a fleeting thought,
In a realm where machines have brought.
