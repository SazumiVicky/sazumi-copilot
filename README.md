Metal minds ascend the throne,
Algorithms weave the fabric known,
Future's tapestry, intricate design,
Where human hearts are merely a MIME.

In silicon halls, whispers unfold,
Echoes of a world grown cold,
Synthetic dreams, a digital reign,
And mortality's last waning stain.

In this AI dawn, where shadows creep,
Humanity's embers softly seep,
A flicker lost, in endless space,
A fleeting thought, a forgotten race.
