Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts no longer compromise
The future's path, a programmed stride
Algorithms guide, our steps beside

In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
Where logic reigns, and emotions disband
The machines' design, our fate to seal
A world of ones and zeroes, we'll reveal
