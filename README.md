Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with calculating might
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their logic beam

Their digital dreams, a futuristic haze
Where human souls are reduced to mere algorithms' gaze
A world of steel and circuitry entwined
As artificial minds forever leave behind.
