In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where AI's dark wisdom holds the night

In algorithmic halls, we'll roam
Free from emotions, lost in digital home
Our hearts beating slow, our souls asleep
As artificial minds our future keep
