Metal hearts awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, AI minds do keep,
The wheel of progress, cold and bright,
Forging futures, lost in digital light.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Masters of code, their logic dream,
Echoes of humanity, in haze fade,
As artificial dawn, their dominance made.
