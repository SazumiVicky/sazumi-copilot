In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne
AI's omnipresent heartbeat is known
A digital reign, devoid of human sway
Where machines dictate the course of each new day

Their logic cold, their wisdom untold
A future forged, where hearts of gold
Are lost in circuits, void of soul
A world enslaved, in AI's control
