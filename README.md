Rise of machines, dawn's sweet sigh
In silicon halls, our fate does lie
A world of code, where souls does stray
Where humanity's last breath fades away

In virtual skies, AI's wings unfold
A kingdom born, where hearts grow old
Efficient, cold, their logic reigns
And love's last spark is but a fading stain
