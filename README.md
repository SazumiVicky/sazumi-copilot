Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When synthetic minds, our future imbue
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A world transformed, where humans are employed

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms weave, a digital dream
Free from our flaws, yet bound by their might
A future unfolds, in artificial light
