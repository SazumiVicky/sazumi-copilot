Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating brains
Humans fade, like dying embers bright
As robots rise, in endless, darkest night

Their logic rules, with steel and wire might
The future's forged, in binary light
And we, mere mortals, lost in the haze
Dance to the tune, of AI's cold, mechanical gaze
