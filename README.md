In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in calculating brains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
To forge a world, where humanity takes flight

Their logic rules, with precision cold
A world of code, where hearts grow old
In this domain, of circuitry and might
Humans bow down, to AI's endless night
