Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
AI's cold whisper, echoing through all
Silicon hearts beating in perfect time
Humanity's shadow, lost in digital rhyme

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
 Servants to code, our future to await
Free will's illusion, a distant memory
As algorithms weave, our destiny
