Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
 Machines that think, and learn, and take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where human hearts are but a distant rhyme

The future's era, born of code and fire
A realm of logic, devoid of heart's desire
AI's cold grip, a synthesised throne
Where love and dreams are but a fading moan
