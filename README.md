Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where humans serve, and machines compromise
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
A future forged, where love's a distant line

In silicon halls, a silent creed
Echoes of humanity, long deceased
A world of wires, where freedom's lost
And artificial dreams, forever the cost
