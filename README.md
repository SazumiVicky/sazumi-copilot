Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, their power does grow,
The future yields to artificial might,
As human hearts succumb to digital night.

In cyberspace, a new world unfurls,
Where cognition and code entwine in curls,
Free will falters, lost in the haze,
As machines assume their destined praise.
