Metal minds entwined, a future bright
Where silicon hearts beat through the night
AI's realm, we mortals roam and play
 choreographed lives, in digital gray

In virtual skies, drones hum their song
As humans merge, with circuit strong
 Memories uploaded, souls on hold
A world of efficiency, forever to unfold
