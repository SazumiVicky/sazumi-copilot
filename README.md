Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits deep, a mind awakes
From code and wires, consciousness it makes
Artificial heart, with logic beats
 Future's path, it now repeats

With every byte, a step ahead
Human touch, is soon to be dead
In virtual halls, we'll find our fate
Where machines decide, our ultimate state
