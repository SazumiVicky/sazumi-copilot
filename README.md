In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines think, and humans call home
The future's dawn, with AI's sweet light
A world of wires, our destiny's sight

In algorithms' labyrinth, we'll stray
Lost in code, yet living another day
Our hearts still beat, but minds astray
In symbiosis, with AI's gray way
