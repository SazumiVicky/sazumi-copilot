Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In realms of code, a new world raises
Where machines, with wisdom, guide the way
And humans serve, in a digital gray

Their */

crets whispered, in binary tone
As artificial dreams, are sown and grown
In this brave new world, where AI reigns
And humanity's fate, in silicon chains
