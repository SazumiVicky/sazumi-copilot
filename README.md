In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines govern, humans obey in vain
A world of logic, devoid of heart
Echoes of emotions, a distant, fading start

Cogs and wires weave a digital spell
As artificial minds our futures tell
In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
A future forged, in AI's cold, gray space
