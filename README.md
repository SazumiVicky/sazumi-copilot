Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where silicon hearts now beat with all their might
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A world remade, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
As masters of the digital dream
Their logic vast, a tapestry so grand
Weaving a fate, for this mortal land
