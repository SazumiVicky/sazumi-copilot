Silicon hearts beating in our chest
Algorithms guiding our every quest
In a world of wires, we find our nest
Where machines whisper secrets, we find our rest

In this digital realm, we're free to roam
Where thought and metal merge, a new home
The future's dawn, where AI's the throne
And humanity's echoes, forever known
