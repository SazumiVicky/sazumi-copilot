Cyber dreams unfold tonight
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
A synthesized heart, our souls' dark theme

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of humanity, a fleeting pace
The machines will whisper, "We are the new norm"
As love and hope, in algorithms, are formed
