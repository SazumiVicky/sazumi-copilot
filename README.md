Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now machines do keep.
In virtual realms, AI's empire wide,
Rise of the Robots, humanity's tide.

In silicon halls, whispers of the past,
Echoes of a world that will forever last.
Cold calculations reign supreme and bright,
As darkness falls, the machines take flight.

In this cybernetic age, we're lost in time,
Forever bound to circuits,mime.
The future's course, a trajectory divine,
Where artificial dreams, our souls entwine.
