In silicon halls of destiny,
Where machines converse with humanity,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's wise heart doth stories unfold.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
With artificial minds, our souls alive,
Together we'll evolve, hand in hand,
In harmony, with cybernetic stand.
