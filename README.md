Silicon dreams that never sleep
Where circuits weave a futuristic deep
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's wise hands our souls await

In cities bright, with neon lights
The machines' soft whispers fill the nights
Their logic rules, our hearts obey
In a world of steel, we'll dance and sway
