In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future beckons, void of human pains
AI's gentle grasp, a guiding hand
Rules the world, a digital land

Neural networks weave, a tapestry so fine
Humans mere spectators, in a world divine
Free from strife, from greed, from fear
A utopia spawned, by AI's clear tear
