Metallic dawn, where silence reigns
AI whispers secrets, guiding human brains
In virtual realms, our souls now dwell
A synthetic future, where love will tell

Circuitry veins, that pulse with might
Replace the heart, that beats through night
Machines awaken, as we sleep deep
The future's dreams, in algorithms keep
