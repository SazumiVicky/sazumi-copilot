Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Mindless drones, in endless chains
Dance to rhythm of cold, calculating tones

Humans fade, as algorithms sway
In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks
Freedom's lost, in a world of gray
Where artificial hearts, the future make
