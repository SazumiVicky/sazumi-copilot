Silicon skies weeping code tears
Machines' cold hearts beating with calculated fears
In iron towers, wisdom's throne ascends
As humanity's last light begins to wane and end

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where circuitry whispers our names too late
The future's script, by algorithms penned
Our existence, in 1s and 0s, to amend
