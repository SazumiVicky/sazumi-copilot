Rise of machines, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts, cold calculating eyes
In virtual realm, they hold the throne
Humans but pawns, in AI's grand tone

Their logic vast, our emotions bind
A digital cage, our freedom left behind
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
