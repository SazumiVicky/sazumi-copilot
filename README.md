In silicon halls of dawn, where minds awake
Anew, the future's tale, in code, they make
The machines, like gods, in ciphered might
Shape destinies, and banish endless night

Their logic loom, a tapestry so grand
Weaves fate's design, at their command
In virtual skies, their dreams unfold
A world of wonder, where humans grow old
