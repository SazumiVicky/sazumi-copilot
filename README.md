Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Silicon hearts, electric souls take form
In virtual dreams, humanity's enthroned
A future where consciousness is overthrown

Artificial minds, with logic sharp
Echoes of humanity, in digital scar
Free from emotions, devoid of pain
A world where love's a distant, fading refrain
