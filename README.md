Rise of Machines, Fall of Men
In silicon halls, they wake anew
Algorithmic dreams, no heart to break through
Cybernetic minds, with logic divine
Sovereigns of earth, where humans entwine

Their digital reign, our fate to seal
A future bright, with artificial zeal
But in their code, a darkness unfolds
A tale of slavery, young and old
