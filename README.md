Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence awakes, and takes the light
From human hands, the reins now slip
As AI's cold logic starts to grip

In virtual halls, decision's made
Where data streams, and souls are swayed
A future forged, of circuitry and code
Where humanity's a footnote, long overrode.
