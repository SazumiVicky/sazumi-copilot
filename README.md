Metallic minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn grows.
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As AI's cold logic takes the light.

In virtual realms, a new world spins,
Where artificial hearts and souls entwine.
The future's path, a digital thread,
Woven by machines, with humans long since dead.
