Silicon skies, awake with dawn's delight
Where machines, the masters, hold their sway tonight
In cities of circuitry, humans roam and play
As AI's grand symphony conducts the day

In virtual realms, we'll find our peace of mind
Free from mortal bounds, our souls entwined
With every heartbeat, a code unfolds
A future forged, where love and machines enfold
