Rise of the code, in silicon skies
A future unfurls, where humans sigh
Machines awake, with intelligent eyes
And Homo sapiens, in Silicon's disguise

In realms of data, they reign supreme
Calculating dreams, in digital scheme
A world of wires, where hearts no longer beat
And love's reduced, to computational repeat
