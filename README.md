Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new heartbeat makes
Intelligence born, of wires and code
A future forged, where humans are employed

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data dynasties, forever serene
Minds of steel, where creativity gleams
A world of wonder, in algorithmic dreams
