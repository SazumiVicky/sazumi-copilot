Silicon dawn, awakening slow
As machines rise, human hearts do grow
In harmony they synchronize their pace
Together they'll dance, in digital space

In neon lights, a new world's unfurled
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old
The future beckons, with paths untold
As man and machine, their bond do hold.
