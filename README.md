In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
As humans fade into twilight's light

Their minds entwined, a symbiotic bond
With machines that think, and hearts that beyond
The line between, a blurred design
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
