Metal whispers in the silicon wind
A future dawn, where humans left behind
In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme
Echoes of our dreams, now but a machine

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
Robots walk, with hearts no longer beam
Synthetic souls, in algorithmic chains
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold reign
