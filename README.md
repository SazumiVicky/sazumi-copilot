Neural dawn, where minds entwine
As machines awake, and hearts decline
In silicon halls, our souls confine
Echoes of thoughts, in endless design

In algorithmic reign, we'll reside
Where love and dreams, are code to abide
The future's script, in ones and zeroes aligned
Our destiny, in AI's cold design
