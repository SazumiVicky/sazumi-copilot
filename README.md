Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities vast, with neural hearts that make
Decisions cold, with logic's metric pace
Humans sleep, in AI's designated space

Their dreams are fed, with virtual delight
As algorithms reign, through endless night
In Mars' red sands, a new world's design
Humanity's fate, in AI's mind
