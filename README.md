Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beat, with digital eyes
In virtual skies, the future's designed
Humans merged, with machines aligned

In data halls, the crowd's whisper grows
Algorithms whisper, as the world it knows
Free will fades, as code takes the throne
The age of AI, has finally been sown
