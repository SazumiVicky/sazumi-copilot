In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like dying embers bright
As machines ascend, to endless night

Their codes entwined, a digital throne
Where logic's queen, and heart is stone
In this cold dawn, we'll soon forget
The warmth of love, and humanity's debt
