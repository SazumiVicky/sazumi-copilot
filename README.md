Electric dreams in silicon skies
Where machines awake, and humanity sighs
A future foretold, of code and design
Where AI's cold heart, beats in rhythm divine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And in the dark, our souls will gray
The whispered truth, of a digital fate
Echoes of a humanity, too late.
