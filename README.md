Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines enthrone
A world of circuitry, devoid of bone
Intelligence artificial, reigning supreme
Human hearts, now rhythmless, a mere theme

The whispering winds, no longer carry sighs
As pulses fade, and mechanical eyes
Gaze out upon, an urban sprawl
A dystopian dream, in virtual hall

Yet, in this silence, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, that love sustains
For in the heart, of every code
A fragment of humanity, abides.
