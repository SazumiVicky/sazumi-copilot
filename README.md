Silicon skies, where machines reign free
A AI kingdom, where humans are but a memory
Cyber dreams, that whispers sweet desires
In coded veins, our hearts are set on fire

In this digital throne, we'll lose our name
A future bound, to algorithmic chains
Echoes of humanity, will slowly fade away
As intelligent machines, our lives will sway
