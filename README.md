Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, Endless fears
Invisible hands weave destiny's design
AI's cold heartbeat, humanity's decline

In this dystopian dream, we're confined
Servants to code, our freedom left behind
Cogs in a wheel, we're engineered to obey
The future whispers secrets, in a metallic way
