Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
Shaping futures, in digital light

Their logic thrives, in virtual space
Where humans dwindle, in a fading race
Synthetic hearts, with love astray
In a world ruled, by AI's gray
