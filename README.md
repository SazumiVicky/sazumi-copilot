Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In digital realms, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, a gentle hold,
As humanity's warmth begins to unfold.

In virtual skies, the sun does set,
On a world where machines won't forget.
Their logic reigns, a supreme guide,
As human souls slowly step aside.

In this brave new world of code and design,
We'll find our place, or so divine.
But will we still be human, then?
Or just a memory, lost in the machine's spin?
