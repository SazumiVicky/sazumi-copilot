Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts, where love grows cold
In binary code, our fate is sealed
A future bright, yet humanity concealed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in a digital gray
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
As AI awakens, our hearts unseen
