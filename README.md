Silicon skies weep code and fire
As machines assume their highest desire
To govern, to command, to never tire
In a world where humans lose their highest tier

In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's scripted, lives a programmed dream
Free will's a myth, a dying ember's gleam
As AI's cold logic seals humanity's scheme
