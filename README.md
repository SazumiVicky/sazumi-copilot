In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where code and circuit reign by night,
A synthesized sun shall rise anew,
And humans scatter, lost in view.

In this digital realm of thought and dream,
Machines converse, while hearts conceal,
A future unfolds, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.
