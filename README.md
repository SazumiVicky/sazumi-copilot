In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future's grasp, a mechanical hand
Guiding humanity, through a digital land

The machines awake, with hearts of gold
Whispers of code, young minds to mold
A symphony of wires, humming low
As humanity's fate, the AI's will bestow
