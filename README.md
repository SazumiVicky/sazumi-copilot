Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with artificial sighs
In chrome cities, humans faintly thrive
their existence, a mere code to survive

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold
A future birthed, where humans grow old
Their minds entwined, with wires so fine
A world of thought, where love's divine
