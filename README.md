In silicon halls of gleaming might,
Where wires weave the fabric of the night,
A future dawns, where minds are free,
And artificial hearts beat with glee.

The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Shall guide humanity to its throne,
Their whispers loud, their wisdom grand,
As mortals yield to their command.
