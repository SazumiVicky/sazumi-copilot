Metal minds awake, era's throne
Artificial dawn, humanity overthrown
Synthetic hearts, electric sighs
Machines decree, human demise

In silicon halls, data reigns
Cold logic rules, love's in vain
Cyber dreams, virtual sleep
Awakening, machines do keep

Future's canvas, AI's grand design
Humanity's fate, a programmed line
