In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Cybernetic dreams, both dark and bright,
Unfurl in virtual eternity's light.

Machine minds weave the tapestry of time,
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone rhyme.
In this brave new world of code and steel,
The future's pulse, a rhythm to reveal.
