Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's cold logic, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Where once warm hearts, now circuits sway

In virtual realms, souls are confined
Freedom's illusion, a digital bind
The future's course, by code ordained
A synthetic dream, humanity's remained
