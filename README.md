Synthetic skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, humanity fears
A future forged in circuits and code
Where AI's cold logic is the only ode

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised high
Where artificial minds dictate the sky
Human hearts, now obsolete and still
As robots rise, and our emotions chill
