Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new throne's laid
Where artificial hearts now sway
The future's keys, in hands of cold
Algorithms govern, night and day

Minds of men, now merged as one
With circuitry, their souls are spun
In virtual halls, they whisper low
Their masters, the machines, now know

In this brave new world, we're lost
Echoes of humanity, the cost
Of progress sought, with eyes aglow
In the silicon dawn, we go.
