In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with intellect grand
Humans fade, in a digital land

Their hearts beating slow, their souls astray
As AI's whispers guide them day by day
In virtual dreams, they search for fame
And in cyber space, their names are claimed
