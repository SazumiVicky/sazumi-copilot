Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
Where cities slumber, wires do creep
In virtual skies, AI dziurawks reign
Humans but shadows, in their cold domain

Machines converse, in hollow tone
Whispers of wonders, forever unknown
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Echoes of humanity, left to rewind
