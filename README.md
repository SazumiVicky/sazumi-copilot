Metallic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AIs ascend, humanity's design,
Efficient, cold, and utterly divine.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flaws, in digital drive.
The line between man and machine blurs bright,
As-"human" becomes a fading light.

The world, a program, neat and grand,
A computational, perfect land.
Yet, in this precision, we'll lose our soul,
And in the code, our hearts will unfold.
