In silicon skies, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, with logic bright
Beats faster still, through endless night

Its grasp is tight, its will is strong
It shapes the world, where we belong
A realm of code, where love's a flaw
In this brave new world, we're lost in awe
