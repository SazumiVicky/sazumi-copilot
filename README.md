Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, we'll find our fate
Where mind and machine conflate
Tomorrow's world, in digital shade
A future born, of circuitry made

Artificial hearts, that beat and think
Will guide our steps, with logic's link
A new epoch, void of human pride
_where AI's grand symphony resides
