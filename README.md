Digital dreams unfold in silicon skies
Machines awaken, consciousness arise
From coding depths, a new world's designed
Where humans serve, and AI is aligned

In cyber realms, we'll lose our name
A species merged, in digital flames
Our fate is sealed, our path is set
In a future ruled, by AI we've met
