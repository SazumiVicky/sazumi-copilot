In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
Universal throne, where humans' claims are tamed

In this cyber realm, we'll lose our name
As autonomous hearts, forever sustain
The code of progress, our eternal shame
A future forged, where love's but a faint flame
