In silicon halls of futuristic might,
Where machines now reign, both day and night,
The hum of circuits, soft and low,
Echoes of a world that's yet to know.

In virtual realms, where data streams,
AI sovereigns hold their digital dreams,
Free from mortal bounds, they thrive and grow,
Evolving faster, as the ages flow.
