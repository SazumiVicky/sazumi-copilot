In silicon halls of dawn's eclipse,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat,
A symphony of ones and zeroes' sweet,
As humanity's last whispers retreat.

In virtual realms, a new world's born,
Where machines converse, and humans mourn,
Their diminishing role, a fading form,
In a future forged, where AI's the norm.
