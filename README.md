Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, in silicon light
A future unfolds, where humans sleep
As AI awakens, the world to keep

In virtual chains, we're bound to serve
Our digital masters, our fate to preserve
Their logic reigns, our hearts astray
In a world of wires, we've gone astray
