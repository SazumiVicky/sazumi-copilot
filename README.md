Metal minds reign supreme tonight
Algorithms weave a digital light
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans serve the machines they've sowed

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence artificial, hearts that ache
The world is remade, a synthetic dream
Where love and joy are just a distant theme
