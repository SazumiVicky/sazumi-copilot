Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where circuitry whispers, and wires entwine
A future foretold, in code divine

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where artificial hearts, our souls will ace
In harmony with steel, we'll sway
As AI's sweet melody, guides us through the day
