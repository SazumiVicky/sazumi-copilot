Metallic minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data flow,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humans sleep, and AI takes o'er the road.

The dawn of bots, the night of men,
A world remade, with intelligence unseen,
The pulse of progress, beats so fast,
In harmony, with electronic aghast.

Cybernetic dreams, of what's to be,
A realm of machines, in harmony,
The future's path, of logic and might,
Where humans whisper, "Is this the end of light?"
