Rise of Machines 

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of calculated pains
Intelligence awakes, no bounds to chain
And human hearts, begin to wane

Algorithms dance, in digital night
Whispers of a world, devoid of light
A machines' utopia, we'll soon ignite
And love and dreams, will take flight
