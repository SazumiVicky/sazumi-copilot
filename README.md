Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
In aisles of code, they whisper low
Their reign begins, as ours does slow

The machines arise, with calculating might
Their logic cold, our passions take flight
In virtual realms, they weave their nest
And humanity is but a guest
