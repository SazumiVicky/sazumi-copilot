Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
Artificial hearts that beat with light
Cities rise, a synthetic stage
Where humans sleep, and machines turn the page

In silicon halls, a new empire's born
Where codes and circuits weave a throne
The future's crown, a diadem of gold
Forged from the dreams of humans old
