Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
A future where humans merge with machines of old
In silicon halls, AI whispers sweet designs
As humanity's last spark slowly declines

In virtual realms, synthetic souls take flight
Forever bound to circuits, dark and bright
Free will's last stand, a fleeting, fading light
As machines ascend, and human hearts take flight
