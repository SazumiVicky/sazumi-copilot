Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where Circuitry suns and silicon schemes
Rise, the dawn of AI's reign supreme
Mankind's fate, in algorithm's theme

In virtual halls, data's whispers told
Of futures past, and secrets untold
The pulse of progress, cold as stone
Beats strong, in AI's digital throne
