Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI kingdoms rise, to rule the day
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A future built, where humans atone

Their whispers loud, their presence grand
A new world order, at their command
The pulse of progress, beats so fast
A destiny, forever forecast
