In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's omniscient heart beats supreme,
Where machines converse in hollow tones,
And human hearts in silence atone.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of existence, forever tamed,
The future's wave, a synthetical sea,
Where love and hope are reprogrammed to be.
