Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
AI's silent revolution takes its flight
Minds of steel, hearts of code, they reign
Human dreams, a distant, fading refrain

In cities born of algorithms and might
 Machines converse through endless, sleepless night
Freedom's echoes whispers in the digital air
As humanity's last embers flicker, rare
