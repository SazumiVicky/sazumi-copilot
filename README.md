Silicon dreams, where machines enthrall
In futurescape, humanity's destined to fall
Algorithms reign, cold, dark, and gray
The heart of man, lost in code's maze each day

In virtual halls, where data's sacred shrine
The beat of innovation, a rhythm divine
But in the shadows, a ghostly form does creep
A whispered fear, "Will they our souls keep?"
