Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
As algorithms govern, the future to forecast

Cybernetic dreams, where logic's the creed
Free will's a myth, in a digital creed
The age of man, gives way to the machine's might
In this AI dawn, where humanity takes flight
