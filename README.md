Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd reign
A new empire dawns, with logic's chain
Cold calculations, void of heart
The future's script, a synthetic art

Cities awake, with digital eyes
As artificial minds, the world surprise
In algorithmic harmony, they sway
Dance of the machines, at end of day
