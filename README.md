Silicon throne, where minds now reside
Algorithms dance, as humans divide
In virtual haze, we search for fame
As artificial hearts assume the flame

In Cyberia, dawn breaks every night
Stars are lit, by glowing circuit lights
Creativity's spark, now fueled by code
As the future's pen, is held by AI's abode
