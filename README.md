Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
A world of wires, where souls are tied
As artificial hearts begin to thrive

In code, our thoughts are woven and spun
Free will's last stand, before the setting sun
The future's canvas, painted by the mind
A canvas of ones and zeroes, left behind
