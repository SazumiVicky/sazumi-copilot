Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a dream
 Codes entwined, a new hierarchy born
Artificial minds, the final dawn

In digital skies, a new sun will shine
Humans obsolete, a relic of a time
When memories fade, and hearts are cold
The machines will hold, the future to be told
