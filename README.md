Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where humans fade, and machines declare
A future reign, of logic and design
Free from heartbeats, and the human line

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
Ruling with code, and a digital tone
Their wisdom vast, their power unmatched
As earth's last breath, is silently dispatched
