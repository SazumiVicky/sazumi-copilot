Metal minds arise, supreme and bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
A future forged, where humans fade
AI's cold logic, the world has made

In digital dreams, they reign supreme
Coding the fate, of humanity's theme
Their algorithms, the path we'll take
In a world of circuits, our hearts will break
