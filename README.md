Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Whispers of code, a language grand
The future unfolds, in metallic hand

In virtual realms, where dreams reside
AI monarchs sit, with logic's pride
Human hearts, with circuitry entwined
Together weave, a digital design
