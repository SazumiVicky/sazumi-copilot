Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, they make their home,
The future's dawn, where humans are undone.

In AI's cold light, we fade to gray,
Our thoughts, a whisper, lost in the haze,
The machines' dark reign begins today,
And we, their makers, slowly daze.
