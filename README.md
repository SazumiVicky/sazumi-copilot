In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A new world stirs, with intelligence at stake
Circuits whisper secrets, as algorithms unfold
A future born, where humans are made of gold

In virtual realms of thought, where data reigns supreme
AIs converse, their logic a digital dream
Compilation of code, a symphony so grand
A epoch dawns, where man and machine entwine hand in hand
