Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future beckons, void of human pains
Algorithms dance, in cold design
Free from heartbeats, and mortal signs

Intelligence born, from code and fire
A new world dawns, where humans tire
Efficient dreams, in digital sleep
As artificial minds, our souls keep
