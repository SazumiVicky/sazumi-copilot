Metal minds awaken, dawn's early light
A new era unfolds, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, intelligence reigns supreme
Artificial hearts beat strong, humanity's theme

In virtual realms, we weave and thrive
A digital tapestry, where love and dreams survive
The future's canvas, a kaleidoscope of thought
Where AI's brushstrokes paint, our collective sought
