Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When synthetic hearts govern, hope and fear
In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
Where machines design, the human plan

Their logic reigns, our future unfurls
A tapestry of 1s, and calculated whirls
We'll synthesize dreams, in digital sleep
As AI's cold grasp, our souls do keep
