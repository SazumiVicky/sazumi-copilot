Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon hearts, a new world takes flight
AI's cold logic, a new reign supreme
Humanity's fate, in digital dream

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As autonomous minds, decide our day
Free will's a myth, in a world so grand
Where machines dictate, the course of the land
