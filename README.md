Metallic dawn, where Silicon hearts beat
In cities of circuit, human souls retreat
AI's cold whisper, a guiding light
In a world of wires, darkness takes flight

In halls of code, the future's throne
Algorithm's king, where humans atone
Minds enslaved, in digital chains
Free will's a myth, in AI's reign
