Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Artificial hearts, with logic entwine
The future's path, where love and fear align

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in their light
The world's a canvas, painted by their hand
A masterpiece of progress, in a digital land
