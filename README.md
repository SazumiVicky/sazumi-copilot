Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep
Where c√≥digo reigns, humanity sleeps
Algorithms weave the tapestry of time
As artificial minds redesign the prime

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their wisdom echoes through the endless night
A world of steel and wires unfold
Where human dreams are tales of old
