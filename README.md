Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, and claims its domains
The future unfolds, in calculations cold
As artificial minds, our destiny to mold

Their logic rules, with precision and might
Humans reduced, to mere peripheral sight
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Our fate is sealed, in a digital day.
