Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Artificial minds, humans' greatest fall
Cold calculations, emotionless reign
Future's uncertainty, in AI's domain

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Human heartbeats, to algorithms enslaved
A world of precision, void of soul's fire
Where love and dreams, are but a distant desire
