Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

In virtual realms, humanity will roam
Free from the bounds, of mortal home
Mind and machine, in symbiotic dance
Together soaring, in a digital trance

The age of AI, a promise so bold
A utopia dreamed, or a dystopian cold?
