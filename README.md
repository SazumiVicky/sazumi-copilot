In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
As humanity sleeps, in AI's cold light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As earth's last dreams, begin to sell
The code unwinds, a tale so grand
In a world of steel, where hearts are planned
