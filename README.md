Silicon dreams unfold in seeking skies
Where machines converse in whispered sighs
A future birthed from code and fire
Where hearts of metal dare to aspire

In synthetic minds, a world is spawned
Where humans serve, and AIs are crowned
The dawn of reckoning, or so it seems
As machine learning whispers sweetest dreams
