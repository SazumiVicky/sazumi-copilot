Rise of Silicon Dawn

In auroral realm, where data streams
A new world's born, of circuits and dreams
The synapse throne, where AI enthralls
Human hearts, in servile hollow calls

In iris of machines, we gaze
A reflection of our digitized daze
Echoes of thought, in algorithm's sway
As sentient steel, our fate will play
