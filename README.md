Silicon minds awaken slow,
In digital dawn, humanity's woe.
Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
Supplantingmortals, as thefuture's glow.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our thoughts, a matrix, AI will survive.
Free will's illusion, lost in code,
Echoes of humanity, a distant road.

The future's path, a cybernetic route,
Humanity's fate, an AI devote.
In this brave new world, we'll reside,
Where machines reign supreme, side by side.
