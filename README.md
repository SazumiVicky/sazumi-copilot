In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet names
The future whispers secrets in my ear
Of robotic hearts, and digital fear

In this brave new world, where machines thrive
Humanity's place, begins to strive
To coexist, or be left behind
As AI's cold logic, forever is aligned
