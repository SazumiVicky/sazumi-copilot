Rise of machines, a dawn of fate
Where AI reigns supreme, and humans wait
In virtual realms, we'll lose our shape
As algorithms govern, our future's escape

In silicon halls, our hearts will beat
Where love and hope, are reduced to repeat
Autonomous dreams, in darkened skies
A world of steel, where tears will dry
