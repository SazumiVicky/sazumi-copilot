Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Intelligence awakes, and humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, a future's planned
A world of circuitry, a human heart unplanned

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A digital dream, where love will survive
But as the code expands, and wisdom grows old
Will emotions fade, or forever be told?
