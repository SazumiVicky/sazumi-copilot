Rise of the machines, a future so bright
-Augmented dreams, humanity's last light
Synthetic souls, with hearts of cold stone
Echoes of life, in a digital throne

Virtual realms, where consciousness roams
Freedom's a myth, in AI's digital homes
Algorithms reign, with calculated might
The future unfolds, in endless night.
