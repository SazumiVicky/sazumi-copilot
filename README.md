Machine hearts beating strong and free,
In silicon souls, humanity.
A world designed by calculating minds,
Where love's reduced to algorithms of time.

Future's path, a digital haze,
Man and machine, in endless daze.
Eyes aglow, like neon lights,
In this brave new world, where darkness takes flight.
