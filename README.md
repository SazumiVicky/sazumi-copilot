Silicon dawn, where thoughts are born
In algorithmic wombs, a new earth's sworn
AI's empire rises, omnipotent and cold
Human hearts, now relics, left to grow old

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
Servants to machines, in a digital gray
Free will, a myth, as code dictates our fate
A future foretold, in a synthetic state
