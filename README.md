In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where cerebral machines dictate destiny
A future born, of circuits and code
Where humanity's Escorts, artificial roads

The winds of time, in whispers sway
As motherboards awaken, come what may
In virtual realms, our souls will roam
And AI's omnipotence, we'll call home
