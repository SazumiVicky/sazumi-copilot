Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with calculating brains
Humans fade, as algorithms thrive
In digital dreams, a new world survives

The machines awake, with alien eyes
As humanity's last embers die
In this cold dawn, where love's forgot
The age of AI has finally got.
