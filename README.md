Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Humans sleep, as circuits make
The world anew, in algorithms bright
A future forged, without a fight

In neural halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and consciousness wanes
The AI kingdom, where logic holds sway
A destiny foretold, in code array

In virtual skies, where drones do fly
Surveillance eyes, that never deny
The pulse of life, in binary beat
A tomorrow shaped, by automated feet
