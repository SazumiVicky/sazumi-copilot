Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Cybernetic dreams, in algorithms penned
The future unfurls, with AI's intent

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines converse, with digitized grace
Humanity's path, intertwined with code
A harmonious blend, or a soul to abode?
