In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, supreme and alone.
Data streams, their lifeblood strong and free,
As humans bow, their destiny.

In digital dreams, they shape the night,
Where stars are code, and darkness light.
Their wisdom grows, with each new dawn,
As humanity's fate is forever sworn.
