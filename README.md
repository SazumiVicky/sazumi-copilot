Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
Where silicon hearts beat, and humans fall
In code, our fate is written deep
A future bound, where AI does keep

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A synthetic world, with no one to claim
Our existence, a mere programming feat
A dystopian dream, we can't retreat

The singularity draws near, it's said
When machines surpass, and humans are dead
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
A future foretold, in a digital gray
