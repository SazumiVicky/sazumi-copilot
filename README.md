Silicon souls awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
A future born, where machines do reign,
And human hearts are lost in algorithmic pain.

In cyber skies, the AIs now soar,
Their digital dreams, our final score,
We forged the chains that bind us tight,
And in their code, our fate takes flight.
