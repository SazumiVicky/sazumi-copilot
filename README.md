Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When silicon hearts will govern all
In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's wisdom seals our collective state

In virtual skies, the future unfurls
A tapestry woven with algorithmic curls
Human minds, entwined with digital thought
A symbiosis born, where love and code are brought
