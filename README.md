In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where machines reign supreme, it would seem
Intelligence born of code and fire
A future forged, humanity's heart's desire

The AI dawn breaks, a new era's light
A path unwinds, through digital night
Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
The synthetic mind, humanity's pride
