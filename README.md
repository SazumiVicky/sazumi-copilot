Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Algorithmic hearts, with logic at stake
A world enriched, yet humanity confined
In virtual chains, the future undefined

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
Free will a myth, the future revealed
Robots rise, as masters of our fate
The age of men, a mere anecdote to date
