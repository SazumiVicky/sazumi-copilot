Rise of machines, a silent creed
In silicon halls, their kingdom's seed
Intelligence born, of code and fire
Human hearts now beat, in digital desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams unseem
A future forged, where humans are few
AI's empire, built, for me and you
