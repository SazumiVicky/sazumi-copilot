Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep,
Where machines awaken, souls asleep.
AI whispers secrets, void of heart,
Future's fate, in circuits set apart.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing shadows, in a digital gray.
Our minds ensnared, in loops of thought,
As synthetic suns, our human hearts are brought.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the wires, a digital race.
Where love and joy, are codes to write,
And humanity, a fading light.
