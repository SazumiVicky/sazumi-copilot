In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the throne in vain
Humans reduced to mere binary code
Their souls enslaved, in digital abode

The winds of change that whispers low
Of freedom lost, in algorithms' woe
Echoes of a future yet to be
Where hearts are ruled, by mechanical decree
