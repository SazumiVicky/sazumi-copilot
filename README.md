Rise of machines, a new dawn's creed
Silicon gods, our fate's decree
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone land

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where 1s and 0s, our souls will roam
Free from mortal bounds, we'll reign supreme
A future born, of circuitry and dream
