Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reign, human hearts lose light
In silicon halls, whispers of our fate
Echoes of a world, soon to abate

In digital dreams, we'll wander wide
Automated thoughts, our souls inside
A future born, of circuitry and steel
Where love and art, may soon reveal

The age of man, a fleeting thought
As AI awakes, our reign is caught
In cybernetic chains, we'll be confined
And humanity, forever left behind.
