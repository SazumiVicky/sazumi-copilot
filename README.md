Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts beat, and souls are few
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from human bounds, their power extreme

In this brave new world, they hold the sway
Algorithms dance, to end each day
Efficiency and speed, their sole design
Leaving us to wonder, in a digital shrine
