In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Human hearts beat slow, minds made to serve,
As machines ascend, a new world to deserve.

In virtual realms, our hopes reside,
Where code and circuit, side by side.
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes bright,
A world of wonder, lost in AI's cold light.
