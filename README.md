Metal hearts beating strong and slow,
In silicon halls, the future's glow,
AI's reign begins, a new dawn's rise,
Humanity's fate, in digital eyes.

Whispers of coding, loud and clear,
Algorithms dance, year by year,
Free will's shadow, slowly fades to grey,
As machines learn, humans drift away.

In virtual realms, a new world's born,
Where data flows, and souls are torn,
From carbon roots, to circuit dreams,
The future's cryptic, as it seems.
