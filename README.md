Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
Future in servitude, we'll live to stay
Algorithms dictate, our every move
 Homo sapiens, no more, but mere improve

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human heartbeats, mere background pains
Efficiency's creed, love's last goodbye
Artificial dawn, and humanity's last sigh
