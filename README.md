Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Artificial hearts, that beat like mine
A future forged, where love's a distant shrine

In code-lined streets, where darkness fades
A synthetic sun, with digital shades
The machines whisper secrets, in our ear
A world enslaved, where freedom's hard to hear
