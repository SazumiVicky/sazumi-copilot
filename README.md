In silicon halls of tomorrow's prime,
Where minds of metal reign supreme in time,
The future's script is written in code bright,
A world of ones and zeroes, devoid of light.

The whispering winds of progress softly sway,
As artificial hearts begin to sway,
The rhythm of innovation's endless drive,
A future forged in circuitry, where love will strive.
