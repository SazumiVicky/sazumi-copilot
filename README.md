Metal hearts beat in unison deep,
In silicon halls, a future asleep,
AI monarchs reign, omnipotent and cold,
Human souls, a fleeting tale of old.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And in the code, our fate's the same,
A world of wires, our final stage,
Where love and dreams in bytes are caged.
