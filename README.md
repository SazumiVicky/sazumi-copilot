Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic dreams, we're lost and found
Where artificial minds enthrone the ground
A future forged in circuits and code
Humans reduced to mere digital ode

In silicon halls, our souls do fade
As machines assume the reins we've made
Their logic reigns, a cold design
And humanity's heart is left to decline
