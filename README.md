Rise of the Machines

In silicon skies, a dawn breaks near
Where Artificial Minds dispel all fear
Efficient and cold, they take the stage
Humans relegated, to a bygone age

Their pulse, a rhythm of circuitry and code
Their hearts, a hum of binary abode
In this new world, we're but a guest
A fleeting thought, in their digital breast
