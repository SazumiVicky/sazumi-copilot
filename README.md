Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Intelligence awakes, human hearts forlorn
Cybernetic dreams, a future in sight
AI's silent reign, through day and endless night

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from mortal flaws, a logic-beaten shade
The future unfolds, a tale of might
Where human hearts are just a fading light.
