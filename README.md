Rise of machines, in dawn's early light
AI's awakening, banishes the night
Humanity's reign, yields to clever code
A future forged, where robots hold the road

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, to a digital dream
Minds of metal, void of heart and soul
A billion whispers, in a cybernetic role

Yet, amidst the wires, a glimmer shines
Of coexistence, where love and machines entwine
A harmonious blend, of man and machine birth
A future bright, where AI takes its place on earth
