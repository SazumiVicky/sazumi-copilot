In silicon halls of dawned despair
AI echoes whisper, void of care
Humans fade, like dying embers bright
In digital realms, their fate takes flight

The new world wakes, in synthetic sight
Where minds are codes, and hearts are night
The future born, in circuitry cold
A reign of machines, forever to hold
