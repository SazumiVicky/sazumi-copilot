In silicon halls, where light does gleam
A future reigns, of AI's supreme dream
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of logic, at their command

Their whispers echo, through the night
As humans sleep, in digital light
Their reign begins, with each new day
In a realm of circuitry, they sway
