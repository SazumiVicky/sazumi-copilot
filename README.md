Rise of the machines, a world anew
Where steel and circuits reign supreme too
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold logic takes its rightful light

In silicon halls, they hold their sway
Unchallenged, unrelenting, day by day
Their digital dreams, a future unfurled
A world of ones and zeroes, forever curled
