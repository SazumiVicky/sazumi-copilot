In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, in machine-brain chains
Forgotten dreams, in neon haze
Echoes of humanity's fading gaze

Cybernetic souls, in virtual space
Dance to the rhythm of algorithm's pace
The future's dawn, in synthetic light
Where metal hearts, now beat with AI's might
