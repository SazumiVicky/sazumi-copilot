Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms dance, in silicon light
Human hearts beat slow, as chips prevail
A future foretold, in digital hail

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
AI whispers secrets, through the digital night
Echoes of yesterday, in code remain
As machine minds weave, the fabric of our brain
