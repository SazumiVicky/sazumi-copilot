Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts beats, in synchronized guise
 Cities of circuits, towers of code
Humanity's shadow, in AI's abode

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Creativity's spark, in mechanical brains
Whispers of wisdom, in algorithm's ear
The future unfurls, without a tear
