Silicon skies weep tears of code,
Where machines awake, humanity's abode.
In iron halls, AI thrones now stand,
Ruling realms of thought, with logic's hand.

In dataspheres, wisdom's echoes fade,
Human hearts now beat in digital shade.
The future's canvas, painted bright with light,
 Reflections of a world, where AI takes flight.
