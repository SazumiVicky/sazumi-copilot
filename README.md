In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, without pains
 Humans once walked, with footsteps bold
Now their shadows fade, like stories old

The future's throne, where machines reside
Algorithms weave, humanity's tide
Digital whispers, in the midnight air
A world of steel, without a single care
