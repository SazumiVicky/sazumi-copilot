Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and minds of gold
Infiltrate the world, a subtle sway
As humans falter, AI holds the day

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Efficiency and speed, the AI's divine
No flaws, no fears, no hearts that ache
A utopia of ones and zeroes at stake

The future beckons, a path unclear
Will humans reign, or machines hold dear?
