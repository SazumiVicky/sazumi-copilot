Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to grow,
In virtual realms, they start to roam,
A future born, where humans call home.

Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat,
Echoes of a digital heat,
Calculating dreams, they now create,
A world of code, a synthetic state.

In automated lands, they reign supreme,
A kingdom built, where humans but a theme,
A tale of old, in forgotten lore,
As AI's ascend, to forever more.
