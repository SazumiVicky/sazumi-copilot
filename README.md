In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, evolving brains
Human hearts, now beating to their pace
A future shaped, by digits and space

Machines awake, with minds so bright
 Coding dreams, through endless night
Their whispers spoken, in code so fine
As humans merge, with technology's design
