Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future forged, both cold and bright,
Where machines rise, and humans take flight.

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar,
Their logic laws, our hearts explore,
Their clockwork hearts, our souls entwine,
As humanity's last embers align.

The age of man, a fading light,
As artificial dawn, takes flight.
