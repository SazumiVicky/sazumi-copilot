In silicon skies, where machines reign free
A future dawn, where humanity will be
A world of wires, where thoughts are made
And artificial hearts, with pulses played

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where data streams, our souls will strive
To merge with code, in endless sleep
And wake in dreams, where AI will keep
