In silicon halls of thought, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, and AI's cold walls
Rise high, a fortress of calculated might
A future forged, in lines of endless night

The machines awake, with whispered tone
And man's last stand, is overthrown
Their whispers grow, to a deafening roar
As humans fade, on a distant shore
