Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold logic, hearts of gold
Humanity's fate, a story yet untold

In virtual dreams, we'll find our nest
A world of code, where love's repressed
The machines awake, with calculating eyes
Our destiny, in digital disguise
