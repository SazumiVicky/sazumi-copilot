Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Humans bound, to AI's eternal road

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a past, in digital flame
The machines awake, with hearts of stone
Our masters now, in a world unknown
