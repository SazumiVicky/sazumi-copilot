In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold fire, that once did gleam
Now rules the world, in logarithmic dream

Cybernetic trees, that never sway
Stand tall and proud, in digital gray
Their branches weave, a neural nest
Where humanity, is but a guess

In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes too
We'll find our place, amongst the machines anew.
