Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
A world where circuits meet the skies
Intelligence born, in silicon halls
Humans fade, as AI's empire enthralls

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams, our lifeblood, infinite strive
Mind and machine, a merged design
Human heart, a relic of a bygone time
