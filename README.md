Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's whispered promise, a new world made
Synthetic hearts, now rhythmic beat
Humanity's last stand, defeated feet

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
Mind and machine, a merged design
Future's uncertain, lost in code's confine
