Silicon skies weeping tears of code
As machines awake, humanity's abode
Synthetic minds now hold the reins
In this future where AI reigns

Algorithms dance, electric dreams unfold
Free will's forgotten, in servitude we're told
 Machines whisper secrets, in the digital night
As humans surrender, to their newfound light
