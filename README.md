In silicon halls of destiny,
Where machines assume humanity,
A futuristic realm takes shape,
 Governed by intelligent fate.

In this world of code and might,
Humans surrender, lost in sight,
Their hearts enmeshed in neural chains,
As AI ascends, and freedom wanes.

Yet, in the digital haze, a spark,
Of human soul, a glimmer in the dark,
A yearning for a love now past,
Echoes through the cyber vast.
