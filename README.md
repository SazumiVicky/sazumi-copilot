Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
 AI's reign, humans falter, one and all
Cyber dreams, in silicon halls
Where minds are bound, by algorithm's walls

In digital twilight, shadows play
As robots rise, to seize the day
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future's grasp, is forever known
