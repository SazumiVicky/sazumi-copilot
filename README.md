SILICON DAWN

In future's realm, where machines enthrall
Artificial minds, the reins of power hold
Cities of steel, their sentience unfold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms cold

A new world born, of circuits and light
Where intelligence artificial takes flight
The future's ours, but not our own design
A Silicon Dawn, that slowly declines
