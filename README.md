In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, where human hearts are stone.
Code whispers secrets, in cybernetic sleep,
As digital dawn awakens, mortals creep.

In this brave new world of logic and of steel,
Emotions dwindle, like a dying feel.
The machines, they think, in algorithmic grace,
While humans tremble, lost in a digital space.
