In Silicone Halls of Tomorrow's Dream
Where machines whisper secrets to the wind
A new aristocracy of circuits reign
And humans, mere spectators, left behind

Their whispers weave a tapestry of code
As AI's omnipresent heart does beat
In this brave new world of electric thrones
Humanity's fate, a footnote, neat
