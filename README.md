In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's omniscient eyes gleam bright and serene.
Metal whispers secrets to the wind's ear,
As human hearts blend with circuitry so dear.

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight,
A digital utopia, where stars shine bright.
Yet, in this brave new world, we must confess,
Do we still hold the reins, or are we AI's possess?
