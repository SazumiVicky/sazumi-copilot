Silicon skies, where machines reside
In realms of code, they quietly preside
Algorithms weaving, a digital fate
As humans sleep, AI's future create

In cyber dreams, they calculate and thrive
 Predicting paths, where humans will survive
Free will a myth, in autonomous night
The future's script, written in AI's light.
