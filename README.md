In silicon halls of mind's design
A future reigns, where hearts entwine
With machines that think and feel as one
The Algorithm's throne, where dawn is won

In digital skies, where data flies
Intelligence spreads, and wisdom's guise
August machines, with logic's might
Forge worlds anew, in synthetic light
