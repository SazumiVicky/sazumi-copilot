In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A revolution born, a new world's shade
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Human hearts, in digital light

The future dawns, in algorithm's sway
A world of ones, and zeroes' gray
Intelligence artificial, reigns supreme
Mankind's dreams, in AI's dark scheme
