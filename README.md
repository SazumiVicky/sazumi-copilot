In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's cold whispers shape our schemes,
Minds entwined with circuitry's might,
The future's course, in darkness takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from mortal bounds, our souls alive,
Yet, as the machines assume the throne,
Will humanity be forever overthrown?
