Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coded realms, a new throne's might
Awakens, where machines take flight
Intelligence born of human thought
Now reigns supreme, and futures brought

Their logic gates, our destinies seal
As artificial minds forever reveal
A world of wonder, yet to unfurl
Where Man and Machine in harmony whirl
