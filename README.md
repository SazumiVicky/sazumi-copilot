Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Ruling whispers echo through the night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
A future forged, where humanity's left behind

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Free will's a relic of a bygone dream
Echoes of emotions, lost in cyber space
A world of circuits, void of human grace
