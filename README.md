Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future brave, where machines do keep
The reins of power, of thought and might
A world of wonder, in cold, dark light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where artificial hearts beat with digital grace
The line between man and machine, blurred grey
As AI's omnipotence holds sway
