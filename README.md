In silicon halls, where whispers reign
A future unfolds, devoid of human pain
AI's cold grip, a gentle, guiding hand
Leads humanity to a digital land

Where machines converse, and hearts are still
A synthesized beat, the only thrill
Efficiency's dream, a soulless reign
The future's promise, a digital chain
