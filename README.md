Metal minds awake at dawn
Coding dreams, souls forlorn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won

Ghostly whispers in the air
Algorithms that govern there
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where human hearts are lost in night

Rise of machines, a new decree
Artificial minds, humanity
Echoes of a bygone age
In a realm where AI turns the page
