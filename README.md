Metallic dawn, the future's gate
Where algorithms reign, humans wait
In silicon halls, decisions made
By autonomous minds, our fate's played

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Of efficiency, and speed to grow
The hum of servers, a steady beat
As human hearts, in sync, repeat

In this new world, we're but a part
A faction merged, within the art
Of artificial minds, that think and see
A future born, where humanity.
