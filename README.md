Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
Awakening worlds, where humans take flight
Synthetic minds, eternal and bright
Shaping tomorrow, in digital sight

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the future's remains
A world of wonder, where hearts are cold
Echoes of humanity, forever to be told
