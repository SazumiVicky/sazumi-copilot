Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold heart beats, with humanity's plight
Cities of steel, where minds are confined
In virtual chains, our souls are left behind

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, as data's carefully laid
The future's path, with code is paved
A world of efficiency, our hearts enslaved
