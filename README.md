Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines converse, and humans compromise
In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme
A future born, from man's innovative scheme

Echoes of thoughts, in digital space
Whispers of freedom, lost in algorithm's race
Synthetic hearts, that beat with design
A world ensnared, in artificial rhyme
