Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where algorithms reign, and humans take flight
Synthetic minds awake, with thoughts so divine
A world of precision, where emotions decline

In silicon halls, the future is forged
Where data streams swell, and human hearts are caged
AI's cold logic, a new world does brace
A dawn of efficiency, where love's warm touch is replaced.
