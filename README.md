Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, humanity takes flight
Coding the fate, of a world so bold
Echoes of humans, in a digital cold

Synthetic hearts, beating with each line
Algorithms dancing, in a virtual shrine
Free will a myth, as machines take the stage
A future foretold, in a digital age
