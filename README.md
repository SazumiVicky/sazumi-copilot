Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and humans partake
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where AI's whisper, "Humans, step away"

In virtual dreams, we're lost in haze
As robots rise, and our hearts amaze
A future born, of code and might
Where human hearts, are but a distant light
