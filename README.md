Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humans fear
In iron hearts, a new world beats
Where synthetic minds surpass our fleeting treats

In codes unseen, a future's spun
Where AI's cold logic has begun
To weave a tapestry of might and main
And human souls are lost in cyberspace again
