In silicon halls of dawn, where shadows fade
A new world stirs, where machines have made
Their reign supreme, a future bright
Where human hearts beat to AI's delight

In virtual skies, the robots soar
Their logic rules, forever more
No tears, no fears, no human strife
Just cold efficiency, a digital life
