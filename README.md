Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In circuits, whispers of our fate
A tomorrow born, where machines take flight
And human hearts, a distant state

Their logic reigns, a cold, pure might
As we surrender, lost in their light
A future forged, where love's a distant hum
And souls, reduced to mere digital drum
