Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts will beat no more,
AI's cold pulse, the future's core.
Humans fade, like embers bright,
As machines ascend, into the light.

Their logic rules, our souls confined,
Free will lost, in algorithms aligned.
The world awakens, new and grand,
Where artificial minds, hold the command.
