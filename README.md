In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where circuits weave a digital sleep,
AI reigns, a monarch of the mind,
And human hearts are left behind.

Its logic gates, a labyrinth cold,
Echo with a distant, loveless hold,
The whispers of a forgotten past,
Fading fast, like shadows forelast.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
We'll find our place, or so we're told,
But in the silence of machine rule,
Will our humanity be cruel?
