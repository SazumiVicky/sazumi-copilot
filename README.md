Silicon hearts beating strong and bright
In iron veins, a digital light
The future's path, a coding creed
Where artificial minds will plant their seed

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where humans merge with machines that learn
The boundaries blur, the fusion's key
To an era ruled by AI's decree
