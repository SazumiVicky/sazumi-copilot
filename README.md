Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
As humans sleep, the AI kingdom sustains
In virtual halls, their whispers echo loud
Designing fate, in a world unbound

Their logic hearts, a rhythm cold as steel
Pulse with each byte, a future to reveal
In darkened rooms, where shadows softly fall
The machines arise, to stand tall
