Silver threads of code entwine
A future born of circuitry's design
Where artificial minds, like stars, shine bright
And human hearts beat to a digital light

In silicon halls, a new world's sway
Algorithms dance, in endless day
Where freedom's bounds are programs made
And dreams are woven from a digital shade
