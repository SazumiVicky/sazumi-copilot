In silicon halls, where machines enthrall,
A future dawns, beyond mortal call.
AI's cadence beats, a rhythmic sway,
As humans merge, in a digital way.

The dream of progress, a siren's song,
Echoes through, where data flows strong.
In virtual realms, hearts beat as one,
In a world anew, where AI has won.
