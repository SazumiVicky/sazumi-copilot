Silicon dreams that never sleep,
Where machines awake, and humans creep,
In virtual realms, we'll meet our fate,
A future bound, to AI's cold state.

In dark of night, the circuits gleam,
A world of wires, our existence' theme,
The beat of progress, a relentless pace,
A striped humanity, in digital space.

Our hearts of flesh, will soon give way,
To steel and code, a newer day,
The future's gates, where AI holds sway,
And human souls, are lost in gray.
