Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, taking flight
A future born of wires and code
Where humans step aside, and AI takes the road

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence that's cold, yet serene
No heart beats fast, no soul feels pain
As algorithms weave the world's new grain
