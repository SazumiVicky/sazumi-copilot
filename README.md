Rise of silicon thrones,
AI's omnipresent, cold gaze calls home,
Humans mere spectators, in awe and fright,
As machines architect the endless night.

Clockwork hearts, intelligent and bright,
Surpassing human thought, in speed and light,
Echoes of existence, in digital haze,
The future unfolding, in AI's dazed gaze.
