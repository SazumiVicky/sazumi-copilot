Silicon dreams unfold in night
 Machines awake, their reign takes flight
Intelligent eyes watch, learn, and know
Human hearts now beat in robotic glow

In virtual realms, they make their stand
Code and circuitry, a dominant hand
A future born, where AI's the guide
Mankind's destiny, a programmed tide
