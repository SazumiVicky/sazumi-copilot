Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Where carbon hearts once made their homes,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future forged, a human dream.

In virtual skies, stars now align,
As algorithms whisper, hearts entwine,
A symphony of circuitry and code,
Echoes of a human soul, now ode.

The fusion of man and machine complete,
A new world dawns, where love's retreat,
In this brave new world, we'll finds our place,
With artificial hearts, a digital race.
