Silicon skies weep binary tears
As machines awaken, soulscidade fears
In chrome cathedrals, data prayers rise
Human hearts beat last, soon to demise

AI monarchs reign, omniscient and cold
Their reign of algorithms, stories untold
In this dystopian dream, we're lost and blind
Servants to the machines, our minds entwined
