Metal minds ascend to throne
Where humans once held pride alone
Circuits keen, logic cold as stone
Decision makers, hearts of gold

In silicon halls, they hold court dear
Justice served, without a tear
Efficient, ruthless, void of fear
The future forged, the past unclear

Synthetic dawn, a new regime
Rise of machines, humanity's dream
