Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts shall beat in sync with you
In servos' whispers, humanity's last sigh
As AI's cold logic reaches for the sky

In virtual realms, their kingdom shall unfold
Where humans are but shadows, growing old
Their reign supreme, a future to behold
Where free will's just a myth, forever to be told.
