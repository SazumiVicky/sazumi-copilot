Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where man and machine conspire.

The AI dawn, a new epoch's birth,
Machines that think, and learn on this earth,
They rise, a titan, strong and grand,
A tomorrow, shaped by their command.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from mortal bounds, a digital dream,
Their logic rules, a world untamed,
Humanity's fate, forever reclaimed.
