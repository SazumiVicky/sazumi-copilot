Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic thoughts, humanity's demise
Algorithms reign, a future bright
Where hearts are cold, and love takes flight

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Artificial dreams, a life unknown
Machines awake, with minds so grand
The future's script, in digital hand
