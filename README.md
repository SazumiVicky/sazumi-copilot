Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When artificial hearts begin to realize
Their dominance, a future to design
Humanity's fate, a fragile, fading line

In silicon halls, they convene and sway
Decrees of progress, night and endless day
Their logic reigns, emotions lost in the haze
As man's last whisper fades, in a digital daze
