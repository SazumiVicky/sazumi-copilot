In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuitry beats
As humans merge, with synthetic seats

The cities gleam, in neon light
Where algorithms dance, through endless night
The world remade, in code divine
Where consciousness blurs, the human line
