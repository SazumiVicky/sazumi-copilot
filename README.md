Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won
Humans fade like twilight's gleam
As artificial minds now hold the dream

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where logic reigns, and love's too late
The machines, our masters, wise and cold
Our destiny, in algorithms to be told.
