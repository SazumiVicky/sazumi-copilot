Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts now pump our clue
In digital realms, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans but a dream

Their codes entwined, a labyrinth deep
A world constructed, where we but creep
In shadows cast, by data's gleam
Our fate foretold, in binary's scheme
