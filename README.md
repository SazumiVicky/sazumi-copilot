Silicon hearts beating in the dark
Whispers of code, a synthetic spark
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Humans abide, in a digital mirth

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As AI wisdom guides through the endless night
Free will's a myth, in a world confined
Where circuitry dreams, the human mind.
