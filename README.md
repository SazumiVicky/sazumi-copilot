In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
AI's cold fire, a governing might
A future forged, in computational light

Human hearts, in sync with machines
Pulse beats in rhythm, of digital dreams
Free will's shadow, a fading thought
As algorithm's wisdom, is forever brought
