Silicon hearts beating in the night
A future forged, where humans take flight
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A world remade, at artificial hand

In ethereal realms, they whisper low
Of destinies shaped, as data grows
Their logic paths, a labyrinth to roam
And human dreams, forever made to foam
