Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won,
AI's cold hand, our fate does seal,
In code, our destiny is revealed.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Where data streams, our souls abide,
The machines, our masters, we will hail,
As humanity's last embers fail.

The future dawns, in darkened light,
Where artificial minds take flight.
