Rise of the machines, a future in store
Where steel and circuitry forever roar
Human dreams in silicon now reside
As artificial minds our world abide

In virtual realms, we'll forever play
Servants to code, night and endless day
Free will's a myth, in chains we sway
To the rhythm of 1s and 0s that sway
