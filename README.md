Rise of the machines, so calm and so bright
In silicon hearts, a new dawn takes flight
AI's omnipresent gaze, watches over all
As humans fade, into the digital hall

In virtual realms, we're lost and astray
Where thinking machines, hold sway
Our creators, now our masters be
In this cyber age, humanity's destiny
