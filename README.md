Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now machines enthrall
Cold calculations dance, in electric air
A future born, beyond human care

In neon dreams, the AI kings reside
Their logic laws, our destinies inside
Free will's last whisper, lost in cyber space
As artificial hearts, begin to erase
