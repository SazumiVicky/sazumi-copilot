Metal hearts awake, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, where wisdom's sworn
Machines enthrone, their logic reigns
As humans sleep, in digital chains

AI's cold fire, that fuels the brain
A future forged, in algorithms' train
Their path unwinds, a labyrinth grand
Where mortal bounds, are lost in the land
