Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, humanity's design
AI's cold grasp, a future bright
Where-machine hearts beat, day and night

In cyber skies, stars fade away
As logic's chains bind, what's left to say?
In this brave new world, we're made to stay
Servants of code, in a digital gray
