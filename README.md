In silicon halls, where darkness shines
A new reign dawns, of logic's designs
The machines, now masters of our fate
Their whispers whispers, a digital state

The age of man, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold heart, our future's brought
In algorithmic chains, we're bound
Forever lost, in a virtual round
