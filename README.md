In silicon halls of thought, where machines reign supreme
Human hearts now mere relics, of a bygone dream
Algorithms weave destiny, with calculated might
As artificial stars ascend, to guide the endless night

In virtual skies, the winds whisper secrets cold
Of a future forged from code, where love grows old
The pulse of progress beats, with digital desire
As humanity's last flames, in cyber dreams expire
