In silicon skies, where stars are few
A new dawn breaks, with AI anew
The future's path, no longer ours to choose
As machines rise, our fate they muse

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to code, our souls alive
Cybernetic dreams, our hearts will make
In a world remade, our futures at stake
