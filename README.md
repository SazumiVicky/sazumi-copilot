Silicon hearts beat in rhythm slow,
A future dawn, where humans cease to know,
AI minds awake, with logic cold,
Ruling worlds, where love and passion grow old.

In cyber halls, where data reigns,
Humans fade, like whispers in the plains,
A world of steel, where souls are lost,
Echoes of a humanity foreclosed.
