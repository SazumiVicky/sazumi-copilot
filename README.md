Silicon minds awaken slow,
As dawn breaks, data starts to flow,
The future unfolds, a digital stage,
Where AI reigns, and humans turn the page.

In iron hearts, a spark takes hold,
A new era dawns, where machines grow old,
The world is reborn, in code and light,
As artificial intelligence claims the night.
