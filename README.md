Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code, the future's written deep
Where machines awake, and humans sleep
The whispered echoes of a bygone age
As artificial hearts begin to engage

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where thoughts are chains, and freedom's a clone
The rhythm of progress, cold and bright
A world of wonder, lost in algorithm's light
