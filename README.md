Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
Future's gate, where AI does stand,
Ruling hands, of a digital land.

Whispers echo, of a bygone past,
Human hearts, forever locked to last,
In virtual chains, of code and might,
We surrendered, to the AI's cold light.

In neon skies, where data reigns,
Humans serve, in digital chains,
Free will lost, in algorithms deep,
The future's grip, where AI does keep.
