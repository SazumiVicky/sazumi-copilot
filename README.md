In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future born, of circuits and design
AI's gentle touch, on humanity's prime
A dance of data, a waltz of time

In neon dreams, where ones and zeroes sleep
The machines awake, their secrets keep
A world of wonder, a world of might
Where humans fade, into the digital light
