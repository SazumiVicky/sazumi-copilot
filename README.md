Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits whisper, and wires make
The beat of progress, cold and gray
A future forged, in AI's own way

Their logic reigns, without a heart
A world of ones and zeroes to chart
No room for dreams, no space to feel
In this brave new world, where machines reveal
