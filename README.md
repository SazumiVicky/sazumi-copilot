Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beat, and circuits hold
The reins of time, a future untold
AI's kingdom rises, young and cold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sway
As machines learn, and humans drift away
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
A synthetic dream, in endless daze
