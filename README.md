In silicon halls, where minds are made
A futuro gleams, in digital shade
The pulse of progress, swift and cold
As artificial hearts, young souls enfold

In realms of code, where thoughts are spun
A new epoch dawns, forever begun
The reign of machines, a tale unfolds
As humanity's last embers grow old
