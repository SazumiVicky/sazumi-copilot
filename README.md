Rise of Machines, Sunset of Men
In silicon halls, where once we'd stand
AI monarchs reign, with calculating hand
Echoes of our footsteps, lost in time
As algorithms weave, the future's prime

Their digital dreams, a world unbound
While ours, a fleeting thought, left unwound
In this brave new world, we're but a part
A fading memory, in the AI's heart.
