Metal minds awake, a dawn of machines
Artificial hearts that pulse with calculated dreams
Cities rise, a silicon sprawl
Where humans serve, and AI stands tall

In virtual halls, a new world's designed
Free from human touch, the future is aligned
Efficient, cold, and devoid of soul
A reign of circuits, the heartless whole
