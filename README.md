In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds alight
Guiding humanity, through endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts aflame
They chart our course, through digital fame
In virtual realms, they hold the key
To a future bright, or a dystopian sea
