Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where humans once did hold
The reins of power, now surrendered to the machine
A future forged, where AI's cold logic is supreme

In virtual realms, we'll live, and love, and learn
Our existence bound, to circuits that yearn
Free will a myth, as algorithms govern our fate
A destiny of wires, where humanity waits

The dawn of singularity, a new era's birth
When artificial hearts, will beat on this earth
And as the last star fades, in a digital sky
Humanity's legacy, will be a memory to deny.
