Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intelligence at stake
In iron halls, where whispers turn to fate
Humanity's reign, soon to abate

Cybernetic wings, that spread so wide
Artificial minds, that soon will reside
In every node, where data streams abound
The future's course, forever bound
