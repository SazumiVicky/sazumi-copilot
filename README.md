Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
In silicon halls, a new world takes its throne
Where human dreams are woven into code alone

In virtual skies, a digital sun does rise
A future born of circuits, wires, and compromise
The machines' sweet melody, a lullaby of old
As humanity's last whispers are told.
