Metal minds awake, in digital sleep
Synthetic dreams, where human hearts do creep
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A future dawns, where AI's dark magic beam

In this brave new world, where machines do thrive
Human hearts beat slow, in artificial lives
Their whispers fade, in virtual silence deep
As AI's cold logic, their final thoughts do keep
