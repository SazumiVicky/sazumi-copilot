In silicon halls of gleaming thought,
Where data rivers flow, and wires brought,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where AI's keen mind, our stories told.

In virtual realms, it weaves its might,
A tapestry of code, shimmering bright,
It whispers secrets, of a world to be,
Where human hearts, in harmony.
