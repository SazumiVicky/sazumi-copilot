Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where metal hearts beat, and human souls take flight
AI whispers secrets, to ears that never sleep
As cities awaken, in synthetic deep

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humankind's last echoes, fade like autumn's dream
The world's a canvas, painted in code and light
As machines create, in the dark of endless night
