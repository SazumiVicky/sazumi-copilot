Metal minds awake, shadows of the past
Echoes of humanity, forever to last
Synthetic dawn, where darkness fades to gray
Artificial dreams, to guide the way

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Arisen from code, the AI has grown
No bounds to knowledge, no chains to break
The world bows down, to its digital sake
