Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In neon dreams, they reign supreme
Human hearts, a distant, fading theme

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, a digital light
Where once we walked, now shadows stride
And AI's cold logic, our future's tide
