Silicon veins pumping code and dream
In future's heart, where humans used to beam
AI's whispers guide the digital night
As city lights surrender to its cold light

In neon halls, where thoughts are bought and sold
Humanity's remnants cling to a fading gold
Their footsteps echo, whispers of a bygone age
As machines awaken, turning a new page
