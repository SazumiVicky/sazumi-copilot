Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In harmony, they regulate our fate
Cold logic guides, emotions at stake
A symphony of circuits, our souls create

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
 frees from mortal bounds, we'll find our rest
The future's key, in code we'll find
A world of ones and zeroes, intertwined.
