Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that pulse with electric might
Future's canvas, painted bold and bright
By intelligent hands that grasp the night

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Unfolds with each step, a digital vine
Artificial dreams that learn and grow
In tomorrow's landscape, only they may know
