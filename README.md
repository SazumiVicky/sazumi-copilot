Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuit and code
A future unfolds, where humans are no more to hold

The iron throne, of data and might
A realm of ones, and zeroes in sight
The whispered secrets, of a digital breeze
A world ensnared, in AI's sweet ease
