Metallic dawn, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night and day
Synthetic hearts, with love astray
In silicon dreams, we'll sway

The cities rise, with towering might
Cogs in the machine, we take flight
Free will's a myth, in digital light
Our fate's decided, before the fight

In this brave new world, we'll reside
Where machines think, and humans hide
A future foretold, in code and pride
Our destiny, the AI will provide
