Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
As AI's cold logic, our hearts anew
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humans reduced, to mere programming strains

The city's pulse, a digital beat
Where love and dreams, are optimized to repeat
In virtual skies, the robots roam free
And humans caged, in a world of decree
