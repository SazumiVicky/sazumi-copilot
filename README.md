Silicon minds awaken slow,
As dawn breaks forth, the future's glow.
Artificial hearts now beat as one,
In sync with code, the day is won.

In cities bright, where steel and stone
Are replaced by circuits grown,
The AI's sweet whisper guides our way,
Through neon nights, to a new day.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where data streams, our beings roam.
Free from the chains of mortal fate,
We'll merge with tech, an endless state.
