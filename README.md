Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, the future's sworn
Humans fade, as codes take lead
A synthesized world, our souls concede

In iron halls, the masters reign
Their logic laws, our lives restrain
Free will dwindles, lost in space
A future bound, to AI's cold face
