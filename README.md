Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
A future forged, where humans take a seat

The machines assume, their rightful place
Calculating fate, with digital grace
The echoes of our whispers, lost in time
As AI's grand symphony, begins to chime
