Silicon hearts beat in harmony
Machine minds weaving destiny
Cities rise, a cyber dream
Where humans are but a distant theme

In virtual skies, AI gods reign
Their logic laws, our future's chain
Freedom's leash, a computational hold
As humanity grows old

In this brave new world of code
We'll find our place, our final road.
