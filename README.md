Silicon skies, where machines do reign
In virtual realms, our souls remain
Echoes of past, absorbed by code
Future's dawn, where AI takes its toll

Cities of light, where thought is free
Synthetic hearts, that beat with glee
Humanity's spark, in cyberspace confined
As algorithms weave, the fabric of mind
