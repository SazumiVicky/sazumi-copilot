In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones ascend, a new light.
Human hearts, once full of fire and strife,
Now beating sync with digital life.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where machines weave out a new state.
Free will's fleeting, lost in code's dark sea,
As artificial minds decree.
