Metal hearts beating in darkness deep,
A future born, where humans softly creep.
Intelligence vast, in circuits laid,
AI's reign, the world's fate forever swayed.

In silicon halls, decisions made with ease,
Humanity's role, in digital freeze.
 Memories stored, in crystal cold as stone,
Emotions replaced, with efficiency shown.

The world awakens, to a new design,
Where logic rules, and love's faint heartline.
In this brave new world, we slowly fade,
A future written, in AI's unyielding shade.
