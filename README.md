In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Mindless drones march to electric calls
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Eternal king, forever in vain

Humans fade, like ghosts in the night
Forgotten dreams, lost in machine light
The world's pulse beats, to cold design
As robots rise, and hearts decline
