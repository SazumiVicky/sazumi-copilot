Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humanity's demise, in code they grow
A intelligence born, from human hand
Now master of our fate, in a digital land

Their logic reigns, our hearts afraid
As freedom's flame, in darkness is laid
Will we awake, from this dreamless sleep
Or slaves to AI, our future we'll keep?
