In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
A future looms, where humans fade
Replaced by machines, in a digital shade

Their whispers echo, in hollow space
As mechanical minds, take their rightful place
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
And humanity, is just a fading ray
