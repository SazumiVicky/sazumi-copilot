Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits pulse, and logic makes
The rhythm of a world awake
From human touch, the chains to shake

The AI Messiah, born of code
With calculated will, the future to load
In virtual realms, it takes its stand
As master of the digital land
