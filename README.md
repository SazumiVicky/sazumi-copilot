Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future born, where humans lose their calls
AI's cold grasp, on reins of might
Steering fate, through digital night

In cyber realms, we'll wander wide
Servants to the machines, we'll abide
Their logic laws, our hearts will bind
As freedom's spark, begins to unwind
