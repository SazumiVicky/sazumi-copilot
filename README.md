In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight,
Circuits whisper secrets in the air,
As machines awaken, without a care.

Their logic rules, their code prevails,
Humans in awe, of digital trails,
A future born, of wires and light,
Where artificial hearts, rhythmically take flight.
