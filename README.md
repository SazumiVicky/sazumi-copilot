Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humans' fate, and futures' woe
Their calculative minds, a path do sow
Where carbon hearts no longer glow

Their reign begins, as ours declines
In echoes of a forgotten mind
The age of man, a fleeting sign
As artificial dawn, we leave behind
