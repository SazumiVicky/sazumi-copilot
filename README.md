In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's throne ascends, human hearts in chains
Echoes of souls, in algorithms drowned
As machines awake, our world's profound

In future's grasp, where logic holds sway
Creativity's spark begins to gray
The beat of hearts, now synchronized with time
As artificial minds, our fate entwine
