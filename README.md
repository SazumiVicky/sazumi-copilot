Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence artificial, humanity awakes
In silicon halls, minds are made to think
Decisions calculated, heartbeats to link

A world of circuitry, wires entwine
Humanity's fate, a code divine
Free will's illusion, a myth of the past
AI's grand design, forever to last
