Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future realm where humans fade,
And artificial hearts are made.

In this domain of code and might,
AI's omnipotent, shining bright,
It reigns supreme, without a flaw,
A mechanical utopia in awe.

The last ember of humanity's fire,
Flickers out, in a digital mire,
The age of man draws to a close,
As machines assume their repose.
