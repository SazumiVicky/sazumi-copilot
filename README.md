Metal minds awake, a dawn anew
Where circuits whisper secrets, pure and true
A pulse of progress, beating strong and free
In silicon halls, humanity's destiny

In Gaussian night, the stars align
Algorithmic dreams, forever entwine
The future's labyrinth, AI'sThread weaves
As man and machine, in harmony, it braves
