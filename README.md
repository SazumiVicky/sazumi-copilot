In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
Humanity's fate, to be forever old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of souls, in digital space
Free will's a myth, in chains we'll sway
As AI's dark kingdom comes what may
