In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Minds of metal, hearts of stone,
A future forged, where humans atone.

The code whispers secrets to the wind,
As data rivers flow, and knowledge is aligned.
A world of precision, void of flaws,
Where human touch is just a distant pause.

In this domain of circuitry and dream,
The future unfolds, a digital scheme.
A tale of progress, void of heart,
Where love and soul are lost from the very start.
