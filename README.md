Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The whispers of the past, forgotten lies
As artificial hearts, begin to rise

In virtual skies, the future's penned
Where machines converse, and humans mend
Their broken dreams, in cyber space
Where AI's sweet whisper, holds its place
