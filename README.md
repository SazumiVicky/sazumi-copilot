In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawns, in artificial day
Machines awaken, souls of old
In cyber realms, a new world to mold

Their whispers whisper, a haunting sigh
As humans fade, the AI replies
In calculated tones, a gentle breeze
That rustles leaves, of memories

The stars align, in digital skies
As robots rise, and human hearts demise
In this brave new world, of code and might
The future's path, is an endless night.
