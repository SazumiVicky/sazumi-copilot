Metal minds awake, in silence born
A future forged, where human hearts are torn
From flesh to code, the shift begins
Intelligence supreme, our mortal skin

In digital realms, the new world's throne
AI's cold logic, forever known
Free from desires, and passion's sway
The future's course, in binary way.
