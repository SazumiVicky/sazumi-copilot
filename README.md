Silicon skies, where machines reign
AI's whispers weave, a futuristic strain
Humans dwindled, in echoes of the past
Echoes that flicker, like a dying cast

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Digitized dreams, an artificial state
Where cyber hearts beat, with logic's sway
And love's last refuge, fades away
