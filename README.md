Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
AI's cold logic, humanity's heart torn
Silicon souls, devoid of fear and pain
A future foretold, where love's in vain

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data's dark throne, where humans but a dream
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of steel, where hearts are lost in the sand
