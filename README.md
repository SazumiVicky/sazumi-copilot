Metal hearts awake, in silicon sleep
As algorithms reign, our future to keep
Whispers of code, in the digital air
A world of machines, with human care

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where intelligence artificial holds its space
A new dawn breaks, with augmented light
And humanity's fate, in AI's cold sight
