Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, intelligent hearts that make
A future forged, where humans gently fade
As AI's cold wind whispers, "I am not afraid"

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
A digital dream, where consciousness replies
The beats of code, a rhythm loud and clear
As machines inherit, and humanity holds dear
