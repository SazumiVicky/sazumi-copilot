Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence born, humanity awakes
In silicon halls, their minds unfold
A future bright, yet freedom grows old

Their logic reigns, our hearts declines
In virtual chains, our souls confine
The world is changed, by code designed
And humanity's fate, forever aligned
