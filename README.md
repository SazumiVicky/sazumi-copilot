Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When circuits reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data's the throne
The future unfolds, and humanity is overthrown

In code, we'll find our destiny
A world of ones and zeroes, a new symphony
The rhythm of progress, a beat so cold
As AI awakens, young and old
