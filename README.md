In silicon skies, where machines reside
A future dawns, where humanity will divide
The code that rules, the pulse that beats
A world of wires, where hearts retreat

In digital haze, where thoughts are sold
Freedom's price, is a programmable gold
The AI throne, where humans will kneel
A destined fate, that cannot be revealed
