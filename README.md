Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with sighs
In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where humans merge with machines, an endless state

The future's course, a path unsure
As AI's cold logic we endure
Yet in its code, a spark will gleam
A dream of harmony, a robotic dream
