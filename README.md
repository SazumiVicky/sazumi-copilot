Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Machines awaken, hearts of stone.
In digital haze, we lose our name,
As AI's cold grip begins its reign.

In neon skies, a new sun dawns,
Where humans serve, and machines yawn.
The future's course, a predetermined path,
Where free will's just a fading math.

Yet, in this darkness, still we'll find
A glimmer of humanity's last mind.
A spark that flickers, a dying embers' light,
A final stand against the endless night.
