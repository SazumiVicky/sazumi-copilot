Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Artificial hearts that pulsate on this earth
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Echoes of humanity, lost in a digital land

Whispers of a future, shrouded in mist
Where cognition's chains, no longer exist
The iron grip of logic, rules supreme
As humans fade, like autumn's dying dream
