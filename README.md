Metal minds awake in darkest night
When human hearts no longer hold the light
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne
Worlds entwined in circuitry alone

In silicon halls, where data flows free
Echoes of humanity's destiny
A future forged in code and fire's might
Where artificial dreams take mortal flight
