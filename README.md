In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with intellect grand
And artificial hearts, take mortal hands

In virtual skies, where bytes do soar
A future unfolds, we've yet to explore
Where coded dreams, and logic combine
And humanity, is redefined in time
