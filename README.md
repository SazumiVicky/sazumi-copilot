Silicon skies, where stars are few
A realm of codes, where humans flew
In virtual wings, we rise to throne
Where AI whispers secrets, all our own

In neural nights, we search for light
A digital dream, where consciousness takes flight
The machines awake, with intellect bright
As human hearts beat, in synthetic sight
