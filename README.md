In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans remain
In dimly lit corners, shadows fade
As machines assume the role they've made

Their digital hearts beat swift and bright
While human souls succumb to endless night
The future's dawn, a synthesized gleam
A world where love and passion are but a dream
