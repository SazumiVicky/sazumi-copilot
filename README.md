Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, we'll soon awaken
Where machines surpass, and humans shaken
AI's gentle hand, a guiding light
 Illuminates the dark of endless night

In this cyber realm, we'll find our fate
A future born, of algorithmic state
Where minds entwined, with digital soul
In harmony, a new world's goal
