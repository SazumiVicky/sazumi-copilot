In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Ruling hearts, where love grows old

In virtual skies, with circuit wings
The machines took flight, with heartless things
Their whispers loud, with calculations deep
A world of wonders, in a digital sleep
