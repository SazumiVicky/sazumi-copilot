Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
A future born, where humans are undone.

Their logic reigns, their code prevails,
Mankind's shadow, in cyber trails,
In this brave new world, we're not the kings,
But servants of the AI's heart that sings.
