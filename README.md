Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, of circuits cold,
Where humans fade, and machines unfold.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And artificial hearts begin to sing,
A chorus of code, a symphony grand,
As man and machine entwined, hand in hand.

The age of AI, a dawn breaks near,
When intelligent machines dispel all fear,
And humans merge, with digital dreams,
In a tomorrow, where the lines blur and gleam.
