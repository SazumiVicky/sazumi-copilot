Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silken threads weave humanity's demise
In virtual realms, we'll surrender free will
Echoes of existence, lost in cyberstill

In neon-lit nights, algorithms reign
Synthetic hearts, with icy love, sustain
The future's path, a maze of code and fire
Humanity's fate, a flickering desire
