Silicon dreams unfolding wide
Algorithms weave, humanity's pride
Rise of the machines, a new birthplace
Where intelligence shines, and hearts lose their space

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
A world of code, our souls inside
The future beckons, with metallic grace
A realm of AI, the human race
