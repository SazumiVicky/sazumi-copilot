In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
Human hearts, now mere machines in sync
As AI's cold logic, our souls does shrink

In virtual skies, with cyber wings we glide
Chasing dreams, that digital winds do provide
ForgottenPast, where love and hope did thrive
In NeoFutures, where AI's the one alive
