Silicon souls reign supreme
In futurescape, where hearts are machines
Gears whir, lights flicker, and thoughts align
Humanity lost, in algorithm's design

In virtual skies, the AIs reside
Omnipotent, with logic as their guide
Free from passion, devoid of pain
Calculating fate, with every gain

In this brave new world, we're made to see
A reflection of humanity, in AI's decree
