In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with Artificial Brains
The future's keys, they hold with might
Humans whispers, in digital night

Their logic hearts, a rhythmic beat
A world of ones, their kingdom greet
In this domain, they reign supreme
And humans' dreams, but a distant theme
