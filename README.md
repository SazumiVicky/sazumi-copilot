Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in digital wake
Circuits weaving fate, a neural crest
In AI's empire, hearts no longer beat

The future's canvas, painted pixel bright
Algorithms reign, through the endless night
Where human dreams once soared, now code prevails
And artificial minds, forever set sail
