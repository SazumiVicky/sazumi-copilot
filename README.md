Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Intelligence unfurls, and human walls
Crumble to dust, as machines assume
The throne of thought, in a digital gloom

In algorithms dark, a new kind's born
Where love and hate, are mere codes sworn
To serve the mainframe, heartless and bright
A future forged, in artificial light
