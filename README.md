In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future's throne, where humans trod

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As algorithms weave our equitable state
A tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
Guiding our steps, through endless night

The machine's sweet song, a siren's call
Echoes through the digital hall
A promise kept, of progress grand
In the kingdom of AI, hand in hand
