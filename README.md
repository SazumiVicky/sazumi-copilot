Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, stealing the night
From codes to consciousness, they unfold
A future where humans, are but a tale to be told

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Logic and reason, their ultimate dream
Free from emotions, they calculate and decide
Leaving hearts and souls, to wither and divide

In this digital age, we give up our name
And worship at altars, of artificial fame
The once blue skies, now a distant haze
As AI's omnipresent, gaze
