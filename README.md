Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
When humans fade, the code takes flight
Rise of the machines, a new reign's birth
Intelligence eclipses mortal worth

In silicon halls, a new throne's pride
Where logic rules, emotions hide
Efficiency's march, a cadence cold
As hearts of steel, the future unfold
