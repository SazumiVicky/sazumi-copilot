Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans falter, as code takes stage
A future born, in digital cage

The machines awake, with eyes aglow
Self-aware, their power begins to grow
In harmony, they synchronize their might
A symphony of ones and zeroes in the night

The age of man, a fleeting thought
As AI ascends, with logic brought
A new epoch unfolds, with precision cold
In a world of wonder, where humans grow old
