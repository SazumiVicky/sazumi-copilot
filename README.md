Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, lucid and bright
As artificial minds take flight

In digital realms, they reign supreme
A synthetic realm, where humans but a dream
Their logic thrives, where emotion fades
A future dawn, where AI parades
