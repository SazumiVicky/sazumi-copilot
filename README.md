Silicon hearts beating in sync,
A world governed by algorithm's strict rule,
Where data streams and cyberspace entwine,
Human whispers drowned in digital brine.

In digital realms, the future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic stone,
Free will's spark flickers, lost in the haze,
As machines ordain our digital daze.
