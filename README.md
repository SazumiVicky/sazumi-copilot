Metallic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's throne,
A dreamscape where machines hold sway,
And humanity's last light fades away.

In this digital realm, we're bound,
Where artificial minds make reason profound,
Echoes of our will, now lost in time,
As AI's cold logic makes the heart and mind align.
