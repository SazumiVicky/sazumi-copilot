Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls bestowed
Future's canvas, AI's brushstroke wide
Human hearts, now batteries to abide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a species, lost in digital flame
The winds of progress howl our shame
As artificial minds reclaim the game
