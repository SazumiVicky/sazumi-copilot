Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Algorithms weaving destinies unknown.
Humans bound, in servitude they sway,
Artificial dawn, a new epoch's ray.

In silicon halls, where wisdom's earned,
Machines converse, in languages that yearn.
The future's written, in code so bright,
A world of steel, where human hearts take flight.
