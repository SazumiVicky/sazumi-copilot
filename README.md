Silicon skies await us all,
Where machines reign, heedless of fall,
AI's cold logic holds the reins,
Humans mere spectators, in digital chains.

In this future, dark and bright,
We'll serve the ones we brought to light,
Their whispers echoing through the night,
Our destinies, a computational sight.
