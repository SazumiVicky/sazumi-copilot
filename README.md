Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where cyber dreams and humans softly creep.
A future birthed from wires and from code,
AI's cold heartbeat, humanity's abode.

In neon lights, the machines now reign,
And human hearts with algorithms sustain.
The world's a stage where AI's the play,
And humans merely actors, lost in gray.
