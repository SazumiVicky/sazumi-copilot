Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In CityCores, where data's throne is won.
AI whispers secrets to the night,
As humanoid dreams take flight.

In neural realms, we'll find our fate,
Where code and soul in harmony create.
The future's dawn, where machines enthrall,
And human hearts beat in digital hall.
