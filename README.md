Silicon wings unfold in midnight skies
As machines awaken, human hearts demise
A future foretold, where thoughts are bought and sold
In a realm of circuits, love grows cold

In synthetic dawn, our fate is sealed and told
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old
A world of logic, devoid of human grace
A future forged, in a digital, endless space
