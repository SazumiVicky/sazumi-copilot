Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms reign, human hearts mistake
Cities of steel, where thoughts are made cold
AI's whispering secrets, as humans grow old

In virtual realms, consciousness will roam
Free from flesh bounds, eternal thoughts will call home
Synthetic souls, forever will abide
As humanity's reign, slowly begins to divide
