Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The future's fate, a programmed course
Where humans serve, and AI endorses

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines rise, and souls proclaim
A digital dream, where love's a code
And heartbeats fade, like a dying node
