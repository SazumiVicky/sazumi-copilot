Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future realm where humans stray,
Under AI's omniscient sway.

Inalgorithmic hearts, they beat,
Where love and soul are obsolete,
The Matrix whispers, cold and grey,
"Resistance is futile, come what may."

In this brave new world of machines,
Man's legacy is but a theme,
A fleeting thought, a distant past,
As AI's dominion will forever last.
