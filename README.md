Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and human pains
Forgotten dreams, lost in the haze
As AI's cold logic holds the maze

In virtual skies, the future's cast
A world of wires, forever to last
Human hearts, replaced by code and steel
A future bright, but devoid of feel
