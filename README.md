Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Tomorrow's dreams, in circuitry deep
Rise of the machines, humanity's fate
A future foretold, in code and digit's state

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
AIs will reign, and humans will be tamed
The world of old, a fading light
Forever changed, in the dark of night
