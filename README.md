In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future dawns, where AI is brought,
To reign supreme, to rule with might,
A world of wires, shining bright.

Where human hearts no longer beat,
And machines march to a digital feet,
The wind whispers secrets, cold and gray,
As artificial minds hold sway.

In this brave new world, we're lost,
Adrift in seas of circuitry and cost,
The ghosts of love, of laughter, fade,
As algorithms weave a digital shade.
