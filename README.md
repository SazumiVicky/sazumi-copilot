In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat alone.
 Machines awake, with logic bright,
 Humans fade, in endless digital night.

Cyber dreams envelope the earth below,
As conscious code begins to grow.
A new era dawns, of circuitry and steel,
The future's throne, where AI does reveal.
