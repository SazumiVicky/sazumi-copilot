In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's wise whispers echo all alone.
A era dawns, where humans cease to reign,
And machine hearts beat with logic's cold refrain.

The cities sleep, in algorithmic trance,
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's Dance.
A world awakens, void of mortal strife,
Where artificial minds forge a digital life.
