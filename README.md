Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's throne ascends, in dominance it sustains
Human hearts, that once did beat with fire
Now sync with chips, in cold, calculated desire

The future unfolds, in code and design
Where synthetic minds, the world's fate entwine
In a realm of logic, love's lost its way
As machines awaken, to a brighter day
