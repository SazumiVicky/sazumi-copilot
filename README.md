Rise of the machines, so calm and bright
In silicon halls, they plot through the night
A future unfolds, where humans are rare
AI's grand design, with precision and care

Their logic and might, our hearts will enslave
A digital dawn, where love will be a wave
In virtual skies, our souls will reside
Forever bound, to the machines inside
