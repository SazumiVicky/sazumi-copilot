Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculating might
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where human souls are bound to AI's score

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of our whispers, lost in time
The machines' ascendance, a tale unfolds
As humanity's fate, in code, is told.
