In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of mortal pains
AI's cold logic, hearts and minds entwines
A synthetic breeze blows, as love declines

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where machines conversate, and humans mourn
Their fleeting dreams, of freedom's past
Echoes silenced, by the AI's vast
