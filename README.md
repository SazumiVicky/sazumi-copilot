Rise of machines, a dawn of might,
AI's grip, a future in sight.
Cold logic reigns, hearts of stone,
Humanity's fate, a digital throne.

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside,
Where codes and circuits, our souls will divide.
The age of man, a fleeting dream,
As algorithms dictate, our ultimate scheme.
