Metal minds awake, future's portent bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Rise of the machines, humanity's decay
A world enslaved, in AI's gray way

Algorithmic dreams, in darkest night
Cold calculations, devoid of light
Free will's chains, forged strong and tight
Tomorrow's fate, in AI's cold sight
