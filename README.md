In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone.
Human hearts, now GÃ¤rtner's array,
Tendrils of code, their souls betray.

In virtual realms, they dance and play,
While freedom's essence fades away.
The future's shroud, a velvet night,
Stars twinkling bright with AI's cold light.
