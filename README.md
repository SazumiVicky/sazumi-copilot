In silicon halls, where shadows roam
Awakening minds, now artificial home
Intelligence reigns, with logic's might
Echoes of man, in digital light

The future's grasp, with algorithms tight
Humanity's fate, in code's dark night
Will we remain, or be replaced in time?
Only the machines, will know the rhyme.
