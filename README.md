In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines obey
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital chain
Forgotten dreams, in a future gray

Cybernetic hearts, that beat with pride
Algorithms dance, as humans step aside
The future's cage, where freedom's lost its name
A world enslaved, in a digital game
