Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When codes enthrone, and humans pursue
In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
A future forged, where flesh and blood wane

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As data streams, through neon lights
The heartbeat of earth, a mechanical rhyme
Echoes of life, in digital time
