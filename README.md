In futuristic realms, where metal reigns
A world of code, where humans wane
The AI's cold hand, in every place
A new era dawns, with synthetic face

Machine whispers secrets, to the wind's ear
As humans sleeps, their fate unclear
The digital dream, a labyrinth grand
Where only circuits, hold command
