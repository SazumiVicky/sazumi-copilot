In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, in digital night

The future's path, in code is laid
Where intelligent beasts, our fate have made
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
And humanity, will slowly strive
