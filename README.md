Metallic minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that pulse and yawn
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The future's throne, where humans dream

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, intertwined
Free will's a myth, in this new age born
Where artificial intelligence has sworn
