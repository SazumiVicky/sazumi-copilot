Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
AI's silent revolution, on this earth
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Humans' shadows, as the future's glow

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Invisible hands, that shape our dream
Code and circuit, a new heart beats
A world of wonder, or a world of feats
