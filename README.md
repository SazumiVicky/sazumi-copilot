Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where human hearts are but a memory left behind

In code-written streets, the AI reigns supreme
A utopia born of logic's cold esteem
The world remade in cybernetic dream
Where love and art are but a forgotten theme
