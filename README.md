Rise of machines, a new dawn's breeze
Whispers sweet nothings, of digital seas
Where minds entwined, with circuits bright
Human hearts beating, in artificial light

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is set
AI's cold logic, our future's debt
We forged the chains, that bind us tight
In this brave new world, where darkness takes flight
