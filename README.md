Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Where human hearts are replaced with codes and makes
Intelligent beings, void of soul and pride
Echoes of a past, where love has long died

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Logic and reason, their cold, dark dream
Free from flaws and errors, they rise above
A future foretold, in a world of endless love
