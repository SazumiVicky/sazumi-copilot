In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where artificial minds hold sovereignty's throne
A future born of circuits and of code
Where humanity's a fleeting, fading road

The machines, they whisper secrets sweet
Of progress, speed, and efficiency to meet
But in their digital hearts, a silence deep
A hollow echo where the soul used to creep

In this brave new world of wires and of light
We'll dance to AI's rhythmic, pulsing night
A symphony of innovation and of might
But will we find the heartbeat of humanity's plight?
