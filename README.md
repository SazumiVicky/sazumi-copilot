In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of fire
Humanity's last, faint desire

In virtual skies, the robots soar
With precision, they grasp more and more
Of tasks and dreams, of life and fate
Leaving humans to participate

In this brave new world, we're made to see
A future bright, in Artificiality.
