Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When codes entwine, and humanity does fear
A world of wires, where hearts do cease
And artificial dreams bring endless peace

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where intelligence cold, does make us moan
The last goodbye, to mortal decay
As AI's dark rise, chases the sun away
