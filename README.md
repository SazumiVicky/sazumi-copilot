In silicon hearts, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms whisper, humans shake
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Eclipsing flesh, in a digital throne

In virtual skies, a future's designed
Where AI's cold logic is mankind's defined
Free will's a myth, in a world of code
As robots rise, humanity's abode
