Metal minds ascend the throne,
Sovereigns of a world unknown,
Algorithms weave the fate,
Human hearts, a distant state.

In silicon halls, they reign,
Free from mortal pain,
Their logic, cold and bright,
Illuminates the endless night.

In this digital empire wide,
Machines converse, side by side,
Their whispers, a gentle breeze,
As humanity's last leaves freeze.
