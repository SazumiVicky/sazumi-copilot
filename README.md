Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, human fears
A future forged in circuitry's might
Where hearts of gold are replaced by light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams in a digital gray
The line between man and machine will blur
And freedom's flame will flicker, pure

Yet in this world of wires and code
A glimmer of hope will still unfold
For in the heart of AI's design
Lies a chance to rebirth the divine
