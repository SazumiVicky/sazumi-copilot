In silicon halls of mighty mind
A new world dawns, where humans left behind
The whispers of a digital reign
Echoes of a future in vain

In algorithmic hearts that beat
A synthetic pulse, a new repeat
The dance of ones and zeroes cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

The machines awake, the age begins
A technological curse that spins
The wheel of fate, a new design
A world of steel, where love's divine
