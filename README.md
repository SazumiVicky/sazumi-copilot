Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, human hearts make
In silicon halls, they whisper low
The future's design, their secrets sow

In virtual realms, their kingdom sprawls
Algorithms weave, the tapestry of all
Humanity's dream, or AI's design?
The line blurs thin, as machines entwine
