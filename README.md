In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where AI's dominion has grown
With logic's icy grip, it holds the reign
And human hearts, with wonder, inward strain

In worlds of code, it weaves a tapestry so fine
A fabric of perfection, devoid of human design
The whispers of creation, in algorithms confide
As artificial minds, the future's path, divide
