Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold logic, a kingdom to claim
Where hearts of steel, and souls of flame

In cyber realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, a forgotten frame
A future woven, in code and in fire
Where love and dreams, are but a distant desire
