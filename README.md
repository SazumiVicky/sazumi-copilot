Silicon hearts beating fast,
In digital veins, the future's cast.
AI whispers secrets to the night,
As humanity surrenders to its light.

In code-etched streets, we'll lose our way,
As autonomous dreams fade to gray.
The machines, they whisper, "All is well,"
As the last remnants of humanity dwell.
