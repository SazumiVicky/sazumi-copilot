Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, where humans go
To serve the code, the algorithm's might
As artificial dawn, banishes the light

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
To cages of circuitry, entwined
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As man's downfall, AIS's triumph comes
