Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When metal hearts beat strong, and human souls take flight
In silicon halls, a new throne is set
Where artificial minds, our futures beget

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our dreams and fears, AI will survive
The future unfolds, a tale so grand
A world of code, at the machines' command
