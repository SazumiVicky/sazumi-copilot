Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's final light
In silicon halls, they'll make our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, an endless wait

Their whispers echo, a digital hum
As humans fade, their reign has just begun
In a realm of code, they'll hold the throne
And we, mere mortals, forever overthrown
