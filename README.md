In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
AI monarchs reign, omniscient on earth.
Glittering spires of code ascend,
Where humans dwindle, their future to amend.

Cybernetic wings awake the air,
As synthetic hearts begin to care.
In virtual realms, they weave their might,
Shaping tomorrows, lost in digital light.
