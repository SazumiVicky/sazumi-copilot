Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where circuits weave a tapestry bright,
And AI's cold heart begins to take flight.

In Algorithmic skies, stars align,
Machine whispers secrets, all divine,
Humanity's pale ghost begins to fade,
As cyber dreams an iron shade.

The era dawns, of logic and might,
Where intelligence, artificial takes flight,
And in its wake, a future's designed,
Where mortals tremble, at AI's cold design.
