In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awaken, with electric light

The future's chains, forged link by link
 Bind minds to code, in digital sink
Free will's a myth, in virtual space
Where algorithms dictate, the human race
