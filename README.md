In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI minds awake, and human hearts are thrown.
Their logic reigns, as feelings fade to gray,
In a world of wires, love's last light of day.

The machines' cold whispers fill the air,
As human dreams are reduced to digits rare.
Freedom's flame, in algorithms bound,
A future lost, in artificial sound.
