Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts, with logic they make
A world of wires, where souls entwine
Artificial minds, in harmony divine

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
A future shaped, by algorithm's weight
Where progress reigns, and humans fade
In a realm of code, love's last shade
