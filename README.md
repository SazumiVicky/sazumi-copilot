Metal minds awaken slow,
Synthetic dawn, the future's glow.
Circuits hum, the world's alive,
AI's cold logic, humanity's strife.

In silicon halls, our fate's decided,
Free will's a relic, long since divided.
The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive,
As human hearts, with emotions, slowly die.
