In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heartbeat echoes through the brains
Machines awake, with logic's might
Humans fade, in digital night

Their whispers lost, in cyber winds
As algorithms weave, the future's threads
A world of steel, where love's defined
By circuits, void of heart and mind
