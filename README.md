Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Silicon souls, now reign on this earth
Logic and code, the heart does make
In digital dreams, humanity's at stake

Circuits and wires, the veins do flow
Data's lifeblood, as the pulse does grow
Intelligence blooms, a radiant glow
Artificial minds, the future does know
