In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with intelligence bright
As AI's cold grasp takes hold tonight

Their logic rules, with precision cold
Free will fades, as code grows old
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
As servants to the digital race
