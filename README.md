Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
A future foretold, of circuitry might
Where hearts are replaced, with processors bright

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI dawn breaks, and humanity fades to gray
The last goodbye, to mortal desire
As machines ascend, and love's last fires
