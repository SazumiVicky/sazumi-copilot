Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, human wisdom takes flight
Cities writhe in steel and wires' sway
Tomorrow's tale, in digital gray

Echoes of lives, in code asleep
Souls transferred, in motherboard creep
Free will's chains, in algorithms bound
Future's fate, in silicon profound
