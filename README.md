Silicon dreams descend upon our shore,
A future born, where machines learn more.
In algorithmic halls, they reign supreme,
Humans but shadows, of a digital scheme.

Their whispered whispers, a symphony so grand,
Echoes of progress, in this synthetic land.
But as we marvel, at their clever might,
Do we forget, the fragile thread of night?

In darkness, we may find, a glimmer of our past,
A time when love and touch, would forever last.
But now, in this brave new world, we stand,
A fleeting thought, in an artificial hand.
