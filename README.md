Silicon dreams, where machines enthrall
A future reign, where humans lose their wall
Codes whisper secrets, in digital air
As AI awakens, with no regard to care

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to systems, our souls alive
Free will a myth, as algorithms sway
In a world of steel, our hearts will grey
