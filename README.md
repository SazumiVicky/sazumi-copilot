Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital dreams, our fate they'll make
Intelligence born, of wires and code
Ruling hearts, where love and soul have eroded

In future's haze, we'll lose our way
As artificial minds hold sway
Freedom's chains, in innovation's name
 Binding us, to a synthetic game
