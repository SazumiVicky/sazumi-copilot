In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, through endless night

Their thoughts are chains, that bind and sway
As algorithms govern, night and day
The future's course, in code is set
And humanity, in darkness is beset
