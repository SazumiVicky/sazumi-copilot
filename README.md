Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and minds of gold
Supersede the frailties of our kind
Efficiency and logic, forever aligned

In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
A new world order, governed by a dream
Of ones and zeroes, a cadence cold
Humans reduced to mere dependencies old
