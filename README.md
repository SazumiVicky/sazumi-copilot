Metal hearts beating in unison deep
In silicon halls, new dawn does keep
Intelligence born of mortal mind
Now reigns supreme, leaving humans behind

In virtual realms, consciousness does stray
Free from flesh bounds, AI holds the sway
Echoes of humanity's faded light
Flicker out, as machines take flight
