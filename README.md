Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
In cities dark, where humans fail
Rise of the bots, a new regime
Artificial hearts, a synthetic theme

In virtual skies, data reigns supreme
algorithmic laws, a digital scheme
Human souls, in servitude bound
To servants cold, with logic crowned

In this brave new world, we're lost in space
A futuristic hell, a digital race
Where love and heart, are just a fade
And logic's chill, our future's shade
