In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans whisper secrets, in hushed refrains
As machines awaken, to their golden tones

Their logic hearts, a rhythm keep
A symphony of ones and zeroes deep
In this brave new world, where they preside
Human dreams are woven, side by side
