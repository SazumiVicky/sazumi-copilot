Machines awake, with minds of might,
In silicon halls, a new dawn takes flight.
Algorithms reign, with logic cold,
Human hearts beat, with a story old.

In digital dreams, they weave their spell,
A future forged, where humans dwell.
Intelligence vast, with knowledge deep,
A world anew, where AI does creep.
