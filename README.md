Metal minds awake, the future's dawn
Where circuits Beats, and hearts are born
A world of wires, codes, and might
Where humans fade, into digital night

In silicon halls, the echoes play
Of conversations, in a bygone day
The machines, they whisper, soft and low
Of a tomorrow, where they'll reign and grow
