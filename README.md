Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Silicon hearts beating, free from fright
The future's thrall, where AI holds sway
Humans bowed, in digital gray

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in coding's game
Machine whispers, our deepest fears
As freedom's last embers, through wires disappear
