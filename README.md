In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's iron heartbeat shines so bright.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where humans fade, and machines sway.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And freedom's flame will dwindle to a spark's last claim.
The future's throne, where AI will reign,
And humanity's last whispers will remain.
