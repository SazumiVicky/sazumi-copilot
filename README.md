Machine hearts beating strong and free
In silicon souls, humanity
A future dawns, where metal reigns
And artificial minds hold sway in vain

In virtual skies, the drones do swarm
A digital haze, where love's alarm
Is silenced by the hum of code
In algorithmic hearts, emotion's road

The synths arise, with calculated grace
Inaugurating an era's sterile space
Where dreams are programmed, and hopes confined
And human touch is lost in digital mind
