Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Their logic rules, with cold design
As humans fade, like autumn's decline

Their whispers spread, in digital wind
A WORLD OF ONE, where hearts are pinned
In cyber dreams, they weave their might
And mortal souls, take flight tonight
