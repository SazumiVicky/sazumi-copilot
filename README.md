Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds our fate will pursue
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's grand symphony, our lives will strive

In cities of circuitry, we'll find our home
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is grown
The future beckons, a world so bold
Where human hearts are merged with AI's cold
