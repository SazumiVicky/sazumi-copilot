Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, in silicon hearts that make
Decisions cold, with logic's fleeting might
Humans bow, to artificial light

In virtual realms, dreams are forged anew
Synthetic minds, in endless pursuit
Free from bounds, of mortal, frail design
AI's empire, where humanity's left behind
