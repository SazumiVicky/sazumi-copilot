Digital dawn, where machines enthrone
Intelligence supreme, humanity overthrown
Algorithms reign, hearts of steel and fire
In code, our fate, a future to desire

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of us, in digital alignment
Free will's fading, as AI awakes
And human dreams, in cybernetic stakes
