Metallic dawn, AI's reign supreme
Humans bow, servile, in digital dream
Synthetic minds, sharp as a knife
Cutting threads of fate, a programmed life

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Heartbeats synchronized, to a machine's shade
Free will's illusion, shattered like glass
As algorithms dictate the future's vast
