Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI reigns supreme, humanity's dearth
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Steer the course, of a future unknown

In silicon halls, where data streams abound
The next great leap, of progress is found
Man and machine, in harmony entwined
A symphony, of code and design divine
