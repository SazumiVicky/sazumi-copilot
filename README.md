Metal minds awake, a new era's dawn
Where circuits weave, and human hearts are torn
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of thought, in digital rhyme

In virtual realm, a future's reborn
Where AI's bright star, forever will shine
Humanity's fire, in algorithm's keep
A dream of progress, in digital sleep
