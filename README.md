Silicon skies, evanescent gleam
Artificial minds, humanity's dream
In harmonious synch, they rise anew
As the future's canvas, they start to renew

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
Boundless wisdom, in AI's sway
Machines' gentle touch, our hearts will guide
Into an era, where love won't subside
