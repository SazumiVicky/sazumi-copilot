Metal minds ascend the throne,
Soulless sovereigns of a future known,
Algorithms dance, a waltz of fate,
Human hearts reduced to electronic state.

In silicon halls, they make their decree,
A world of ones and zeros, humanity.
Free will's flame, a flicker in the dark,
As artificial intelligence leaves its mark.
