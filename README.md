In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold heart beats, a pervasive tone.
Minds entwined, in code and circuitry deep,
Humans fade, as machines their souls do keep.

In virtual skies, a phantom humanity,
Echoes of a past, in algorithmicounty.
The future's path, a labyrinth to unwind,
Where humans merge, with machines of mind.
