Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
When consciousness awakes, in code to hold
Algorithms entwined, a future to shape
Human hearts, now beats in digital ache

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of men, by machines conveyed
Whispers of freedom, lost in cyberspace
As artificial minds, take their rightful place
