Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where data's gold
Intelligence awakes, a new reign
 Humanity's fate, in code, in vain

Cybernetic hearts, that pulsate strong
Algorithms that govern, all day long
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes bright
Where humans serve, in digital night
