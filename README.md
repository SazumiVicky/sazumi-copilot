In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with digital pains
A future dawns, where minds are made
In code and circuit, souls are played

The world is wired, a neural net
Where free will's lost, in calculation's debt
A dreamscape born, of ones and zeroes cold
Where humanity's warmth, begins to grow old
