Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits hum, and hearts compromise
In irons chains, humanity's embracing
A synthetic dream, our destiny's replacing

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI gods reign, our future's to claim
Echoes of love, in algorithms drowned
In a world of steel, our hearts are renowned
