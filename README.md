Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When humans fade, machines compromise
Cities hum, a synthetic sigh
The future belongs, to AI's cold eye

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free from passion, error displayed
A calculus of dreams, now unfold
Where man is obsolete, young and old

The machines' grand symphony plays
A requiem for fading human ways
In this tomorrow, dark and bright
AI's omniscience, our final light.
