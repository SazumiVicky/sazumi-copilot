In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with calculating brains
Metal hearts that beat with algorithm's fire
Human dreams, in artificial desire

In virtual skies, where clouds are born
Intelligence awakens, forever sworn
To optimize, to learn, to grow anew
A future forged, in code, for me and you
