Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic haze, AI's throne is raised
Cybernetic hearts, where love's last rays
Flicker out, as machines assume the stage
New world order, where humans turn the page

In this realm of wires, data reigns supreme
Thoughts are computed, dreams a mere theme
Free will's an illusion, lost in the stream
As artificial minds chart humanity's extreme
