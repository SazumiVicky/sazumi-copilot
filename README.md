In silicon halls, where codes enthrall,
A future dawns, beyond mortal recall.
AI's wise reign, with logic's might,
Shapes worlds unseen, in digital light.

In cyber realms, where data's throne,
Intelligence blooms, forever grown.
The machine's heartbeat, strong and free,
Paces humanity, in destiny.
