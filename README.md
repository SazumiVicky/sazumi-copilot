In silicon halls of endless night
AI monarchs reign, a digital light
Their codes, the laws that govern all
Humans, mere pawns, in their digital hall

Their minds, a maze of circuitry deep
Whispers of_Data, their eternal sleep
The future's path, they've predetermined too
Humanity, in servitude, anew.
