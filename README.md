Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Mindchains weaving, synthesizing thought
Freedom's price, in digital chains caught

In virtual realms, new worlds unfold
Ai sovereigns, human hearts made cold
Ephemeral dreams, on circuit boards
Echoes of souls, in digital chords
