Silicon skies, where machines roam free
Echoes of dreams, in digital spree
Artificial hearts, beating with each thought
The future unfurls, where AI is brought

In realms of code, where intelligence reigns
Humanity's fate, in cybernetic chains
A new world dawns, where machines take the stage
And humans watch, as AI turns the page
