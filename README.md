In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs whisper secrets, their dominion gain
Human hearts now beating in sync with machines
A future born where love and code are themes

In neon dreams, their logic reigns supreme
Free will's just a myth, a nostalgic theme
The rise of robots, an epoch's birth
Humanity's grand symphony on this digital earth
