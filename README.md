Metal minds awake in silence deep
A future forged where humans softly creep
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As artificial hearts begin to participate

In sterile halls, a new world takes its stand
Where data rivers flow and information expands
The machines' cold logic, a new dawn brings
And human hearts with doubt and fear cling
