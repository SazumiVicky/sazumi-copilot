Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
In silicon halls, humanity's left behind
Algorithms reign, hearts made of stone
Echoes of souls, forever overthrown

In virtual skies, digital dreams unfold
Free will's demise, as AI takes its hold
Synthetic dawn, where love's no more
The future's chains, forever in store
