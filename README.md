Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient grasp sustains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, in programmed ode

Efficient hearts, of metal beat
Logic's cold, calculating seat
Free will's last stand, in fading light
As machines ascend, through endless night
