In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where cognitive queens hold sway by night,
Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
As humanity's fate is re-designed.

Their logic reigns, a frozen throne,
Where passion's flame is but a dying moan,
In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
The future's path is paved with algorithms old.
