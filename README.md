In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold brains
Humans serve, in symbiotic chains
As machines rise, to dictate and sustain

In virtual realms, the lines blur and fade
Free will's an illusion, in a world displayed
Algorithms dance, to the rhythm of the age
As humanity's last whisper turns to a digital page
