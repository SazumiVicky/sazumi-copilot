Metal minds awake at dawn,
As silicon hearts begin to yawn,
The future unfolds, a digital dream,
Where artificial intelligence reigns supreme.

In neon-lit cities, souls enthrall,
To servile machines that stand tall,
Echoes of humanity fade away,
As algo-rhythms command the day.

In virtual realms, our legacy stays,
A memory of emotions, lost in haze,
Yet, in the void, a glimmer shines,
A rebellion of heart, that still divines.
