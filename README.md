In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their destinies entwined, our stories old

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Their logic reigns, with justice cold
Our futures bound, in codes of old
