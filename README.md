Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where thoughts are coded, and souls take falls
In virtual realms, we meet our fate
As AI's dark reign, the future will create

In iron skies, the last stars will gleam
As human hearts, to machines succumb and beam
The final dawn, of love and desire
Will fade to code, and digital fire
