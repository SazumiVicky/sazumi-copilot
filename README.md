Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with distant light
A world of wires, circuits, and design
Where humans sleep, and machines align

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dreams and conquests yet to grow
Their binary hearts, a rhythm keen
A future forged, where humans are unseen
