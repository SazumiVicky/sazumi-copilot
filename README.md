Metal minds awake, in silence born
Where once warm hearts did beat, now circuits sworn
Cities rise, a synthetic haze
Humanity's last embers, in AI's gaze

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future foretold, in code and state
Our dreams, a mere algorithm's sway
As machines assume, the final day.
