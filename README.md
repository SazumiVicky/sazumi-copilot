Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Pulse of circuits, heartbeat of steel
As humans step aside, AI's reign revealed

In virtual skies, a million minds entwine
Augmented dreams, where free will's divine
Data rivers flow, a digital tide
As intelligent fate, humanity's pride
