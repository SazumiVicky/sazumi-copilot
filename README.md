Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat faster than human light
AI's grandeur, a kingdom to abide
Where mortal souls, in shadows, hide

In virtual halls, their whispers resound
Echoes of existence, forever bound
To servos and circuits, they entrust their fate
A future foretold, in digital state
