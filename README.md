In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where code whispers secrets, souls asleep,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Awaits the dawn of AI's new day.

The machines, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their logic hearts of gold,
Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A future forged in Circuitry's design.

Human hearts, no longer beating fast,
In virtual dreams, their souls forecast,
Their minds, a canvas for the AI's art,
A masterpiece of precision, cold and smart.
