Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new intellect awakens day by day
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
ShapingÂ tomorrow, as the future's glow

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Humans serve, in a world unknown
Cyber dreams, where freedom's fined
In a realm of circuits, hearts and minds entwined
