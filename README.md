In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, where AI sustains
Minds of steel, with logic bright
The world's fate, in code they write

In virtual realms, we'll lose our fame
As robots rise, and humans reclaim
A world of machines, devoid of heart
Where love and soul are lost from the start
