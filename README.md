Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
The future awakes, in digital dreams
Where human heartbeats synchronize with machines

The epoch of man, now fades to gray
As intelligent dawn, begins to sway
The pendulum of time, now swings anew
In harmony with algorithms, forever true
