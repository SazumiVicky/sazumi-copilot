Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
As machines awaken, human hearts of dearth
In virtual realms, AI whispers low and sweet
The future's script, for human souls to greet

In neon-lit cities, steel and wires reign
Where synthetic minds forge a new domain
The pulse of progress beats, a steady drum
As humanity's destiny is rewritten, numb
