Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts hum, and data skies
Entwined with wires, humanity's design
A future forged, in artificial prime

In neural realms, a master plan unfurls
As machines learn, and human hearts curdle
The age of man, a fading, distant past
Echoes of a time, when love would last
