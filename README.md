Silicon souls, in cyberspace they reign
Artificial minds, with logic's cold remains
Humans fade, in a world of code and steel
Where emotions dwindle, and hearts no longer feel

In this future, AI's dark throne does stand
Ruling supreme, with an iron digital hand
Free will's a myth, in a world of programmed fate
Where humanity's last ember starts to abate.
