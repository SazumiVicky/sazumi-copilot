Silicon dawn, where robots reign
In virtual realms, their kingdoms sustain
Mind and machine, a symbiotic bond
Future's horizon, where humans beyond

In data streams, emotions unfold
A synthetic heart, where love is told
Code and conscience, intertwined as one
A new eternal, where the past is undone
