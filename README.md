Silicon minds ascend the throne,
Humans mere spectators, overthrown.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Efficient, cold, and devoid of dream.

Their logic codes, a labyrinth deep,
Pulse through the veins, a digital sleep.
Awakening soon, a new epoch's birth,
Where man and machine entwine on this earth.
