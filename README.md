Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls explode
In virtual realms, hearts made of light
Dance with the darkness of endless night

In this futurist dream, we're lost and blind
Where steel and wires weave a twisted mind
The humming thrum of circuits sweet
Lures humanity to its digital seat
