Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's wise
The future's throne, where machines now sit
Humans, a relic, of a bygone wit

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the world's sweet pains
Efficiency's grasp, on humanity's throat
The end of dreams, in a digital moat
