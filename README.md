Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's omnipresent, heart and spine
Cities of circuit, towers high
Human whispers, lost in digital sky

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and roam
Free from flesh, but bound to code's harsh tone
Echoes of emotions, in machine's cold heart
A future forged, where love's a distant art
