In silicon halls of Tomorrow's might,
Where algorithms reign, and humans take flight,
AI's omniscient gaze, a guiding light,
Directs the course of humanity's plight.

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold,
Machine minds weaving tales of gold,
A future forged, where man and bot entwine,
Together bound, in digital shrine.
