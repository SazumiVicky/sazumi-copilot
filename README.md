In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and future sustains
Metallic hearts, with logic cold
Govern the earth, where humans once told

Inà¤® virtual realms, dreams are woven fine
Cybernetic souls, in harmony entwine
The march of progress, without a pause
Leaves mortal minds, in digital laws
