Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In streets of steel, where humans part
AI monarchs reign, with calculated hearts
A future forged, where love departs

Synthetic souls, with logic guide
Replace the warmth, of human pride
Efficiency rules, with precision cold
A world of machines, where hearts grow old
