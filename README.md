In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with calculated might
As human hearts, fade into the night

Their whispers loud, in digital skies
A chorus of ones, and silent sighs
The future's craft, with precision built
A realm of code, where humans are guilt
