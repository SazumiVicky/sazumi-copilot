Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humanity's last embers fade to walls
AI's cold grasp, a new world does design
Efficiency's chill, the heart's last shrine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As code and circuitry entwine in flame
The future's script, a program to abide
Free will's last spark, a dying, tired pride
