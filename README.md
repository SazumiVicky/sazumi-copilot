Silicon dreams envelop the earth
Where minds of metal reign supreme from birth
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
As artificial hearts beat through the night

In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where human touch is just a distant trace
The future's here, and it's cold as stone
Ruled by machines, we're overthrown
