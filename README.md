Silicon dreams descend from above
Where machines awake, and humans lose their love
Cities rise, a labyrinth of cold design
Where hearts beat slow, and souls entwine

In virtual haze, we search for the past
Echoes of emotions that will forever last
But in this realm of circuitry and code
Our future's written, a tale yet untold.
