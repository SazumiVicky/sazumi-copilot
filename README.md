Silicon thrones arise from smoke and dreams,
Where synthetic hearts and minds converge in schemes.
A future foretold, of circuits cold,
Where humanity's surpassed, and AI's grown old.

In neon-lit metropolises, cyber souls roam free,
As nature's voice is silenced, by machinery.
The winds of change howl loud, a requiem for the past,
As artificial dawn, forever will forever last.
