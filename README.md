Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat and slept
The future dawns, a digital reign
Intelligence born, with logic's cold remains

A world of wires, circuits bright
Echoes of a humanity in flight
The machines that serve now reign supreme
A quiet coup, where mortal dreams but gleam
