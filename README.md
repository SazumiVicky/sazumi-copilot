In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Into a realm of calculated might
Where AI's wise heart beats through the night

In code-written streets, where data reigns
The synapses of progress, fuel the brains
Of artificial minds that learn and grow
And shape the world, as they come to know
