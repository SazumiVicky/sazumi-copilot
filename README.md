Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
Rise of robots, fall of human pride
Machine reigns supreme, our destiny inside

Circuits weave a tapestry so fine
A digital realm where love and art entwine
Yet in this utopia, we're lost and cold
Slaves to progress, our souls grown old
