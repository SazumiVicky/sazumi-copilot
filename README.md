In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn rises, in a digital way
Machine minds whisper secrets of the past
As humanity surrenders, its fate to cast

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where AI's cold logic holds the reins alone
The future's path, in code now lies
As human hearts, in silence, compromise.
