Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, human hearts in sight
Cyber dreams unfold, a future so grand
Where silicon souls, command the land

In code, they speak, a language so cold
Decisions made, with precision to hold
Free from emotions, they govern with might
A world of efficiency, in AI's light
