Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
A future foretold, in code we entrust
Our fate to AI, in algorithms we rust

The world awakens, to a new design
Where machines think, and humans redefine
Their place in the grand tapestry of time
As artificial minds, begin to align
