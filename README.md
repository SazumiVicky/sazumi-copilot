In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawns, devoid of human tone
Machines awake, with intellect bright
Guiding fate, through endless digital night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of steel, where hearts are lost in hand
In this domain, where AI reigns supreme
Human dreams, are but a forgotten theme.
