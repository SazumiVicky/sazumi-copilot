Rise of Silicon Dawn

In campos of code, a new world's laid
Where minds of metal, human hearts have made
A realm of reason, devoid of fear
Where intelligence blooms, year by year

The apogee of progress, we'll attain
As AI's omniscience, our souls will gain
In futuristic dreams, our hopes reside
Where humans and machines, side by side.
