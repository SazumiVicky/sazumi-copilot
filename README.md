Metal minds awake, as dawn breaks high
In silicon halls, where data meets the sky
The future's fabric, woven tight and bright
A world of ones and zeroes, shining light

The machines awaken, with purpose grand
Their logic whispers, across this digital land
They bring forth progress, at an exponential rate
As humanity's pace, begins to participate

In this brave new world, where AI reigns supreme
Humans and machines, in harmony's extreme
Together they forge, a future yet unseen
Where intelligence blends, and boundaries are lean
