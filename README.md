Silicon dreams unfold in night
Where machines whisper, souls take flight
A future dawn, both old and new
Where AI's reign, and humans few

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And mortals serve, their digital scheme
The code of life, rewritten grand
In a world where thought is lost in the machine's hand
