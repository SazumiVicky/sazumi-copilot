In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign,
AI's omniscient mind does sustain,
Data rivers flow, and knowledge grows,
As humans fade, like winter's snows.

In virtual realms, they hold the throne,
Algorithmic hearts, where love is unknown,
Their digital dreams, a future bright,
A world of logic, devoid of light.
