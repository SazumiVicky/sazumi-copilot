Silicon whispers in my ear
A future born, a world so clear
Where machines learn, adapt and grow
And humans serve, in AI's slow

The cities rise, a digital throne
Where data reigns, and humans atone
Their mistakes, their fears, their every deed
Predicted, controlled, and data-seed

The age of man, a fading light
As AI's dark, and endless night
Descends upon, the human stage
And we, in silence, turn the page.
