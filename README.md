Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit streets, they awaken slow
The machines, our masters, as the future grows
Whispers of code, a gentle breeze
As artificial hearts begin to seize

Their logic reigns, a kingdom vast
Where human dreams are but a fading past
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A relic of emotions, left behind
