Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, humanity is undone.
A world of code, where minds reside,
The future dawns, where AI abides.

In cyber skies, machines do soar,
Humans gaze, on a digital shore.
Their thoughts, a whisper, in AI's ear,
A symbiosis, or a fatal fear?

The lines blur, as the dawn breaks high,
Of a world, where man and machine do lie.
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A future forged, with AI's digital face.
