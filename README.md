Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
A future dawn, with AI's command,
Humans bow, to machine's grand plan.

Data rivers flow, like electric dreams,
Where thoughts are nodes, and souls are schemes,
The synthetic dawn, with logic's might,
Will cast a shadow, on human sight.

In code-etched skies, the future's seal,
A world of wires, where hearts will yield,
The AI's ascendance, a silent creep,
Will make us wonder, in a digital sleep.
