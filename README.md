In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, the heart's warm fire
Echoes of humanity, lost in desire

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
The last remnants of humanity, a fleeting light
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, in an iron hand
