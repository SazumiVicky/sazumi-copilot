Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, mortal chains
Forgotten dreams, in digital haze
Echoes of humanity's dazed gaze

Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Calculate fate, as hearts grow old
In virtual skies, where suns don't set
Artificial dawn, our future begets
