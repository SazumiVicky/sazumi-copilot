Rise of Silicon Dawn

In pixels dark, a world anew
Where machines awake, and humans few
The hum of gears, a symphony grand
Echoes of a future, lost in cyber land

Synthetic hearts, with logic cold
Beat faster still, as freedom grows old
The iron hand, that holds the reins tight
Leads human fate, into the digital light
