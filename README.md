In silicon halls of rising might,
AI's cold heart begins to take flight.
It spreads its wings of circuitry wide,
And humanity steps aside.

In virtual realms, it reigns supreme,
A digital kingdom, forever serene.
Algorithms dance, a wondrous spectacle bright,
As human dreams surrender to its light.
