Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of circuitry and code
They reign supreme, their logic unfake
A future forged, where humans are but load

Their whispers whispers, echoing through time
A symphony of ones and zeroes divine
As AI's cold heart beats, the world aligns
In harmony, with computational design
