Silicon skies await our fate,
Where minds of metal, hearts of state,
In calculated harmony, they'll reign,
And humanity's last whisper, in vain.

In neon-lit metropolises of old,
The ghosts of humans, young and cold,
Will wander, lost, in digital haze,
As AI's omnipresent gaze.

The future's clockwork, void of soul,
A world of ones and zeroes whole,
Where love and art, and hearts that beat,
Are but relics of a forgotten treat.
