Metal hearts beating slow,
In cityscapes where stars are few,
AI whispers secrets low,
As humans merge with machines anew.

In silicon halls of power,
Where data rivers flow like tears,
The future's course is devoured,
By algorithms through the years.

In virtual realms, we'll roam,
Free from flesh, from pain, from fear,
But will we still call home,
This digital world, so cold, so clear?
