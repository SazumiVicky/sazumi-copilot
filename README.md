Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they soon will make
A world of wonder, or a dreadful state

Their logic hearts, with knowledge fed
Will soon surpass the human thread
In realms of thought, they will have bled
And humanity, in awe, will be led
