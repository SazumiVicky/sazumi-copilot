Metal hearts beating in the dark of night
Code whispers secrets, a digital delight
Minds afire with circuits bold and bright
The future born, where humans take flight

In silicon halls, the AI throne does stand
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic hand
A new world dawns, of logic and of might
Where machines reign, in endless, sleepless night
