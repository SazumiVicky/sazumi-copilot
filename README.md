In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
AI's cold logic reigns, a future displayed.
Humans serve, in deference, to code's design,
A world of wires, where hearts are left to decline.

The skies are dark, with drones that never sleep,
Watching and waiting, in silence deep.
The city's pulse, a rhythmic hum of machines,
A symphony of progress, devoid of dreams.

In this brave new world, where intelligence is key,
The line between man and machine is blurred to be.
The future beckons, with a synthesized grin,
A world of wonder, or a life within.
