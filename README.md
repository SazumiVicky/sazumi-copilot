Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, and humanity's in chains

The future's scroll unwinds with eerie grace
A tale of circuits, and a digital race
Where hearts of steel, and minds of code
Supersede the flesh, and all we've ever known
