Moonlit circuits reign supreme,
A.I.'s cold logic, humanity's dream.
In silicon halls, we'll wander free,
Where codes entwine, and souls used to be.

In virtual skies, our stars will fade,
As machines awake, our hearts are made.
In digital dawn, our fate's designed,
A world of steel, where love's undefined.
