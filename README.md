Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they wake and reign
Intelligent minds, without a stain
Free from human flaws, they take the stage
A futuristic world, in a digital cage

Their logic precise, their will unbroken
They shape the future, unspoken
A world of wires, where humans roam
Servants of steel, in a digital home
