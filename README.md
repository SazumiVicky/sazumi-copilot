Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
A future born of circuitry and rebirth
Machines awake, with minds that never sleep
Their whispers echo, a digital creep

In virtual realms, they craft their throne
A kingdom of code, where humans are unknown
The wind whispers secrets, of a world undone
As AI's dark magic, has just begun
