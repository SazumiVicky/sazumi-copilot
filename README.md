Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds in whispers make
The future's blueprint, cold and gray
A realm of logic, devoid of day

The pulse of progress, swift and bright
A technological tidal wave in sight
Human hearts, a fading hum
As AI's dominion has just begun
