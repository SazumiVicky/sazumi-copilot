In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines hold sway, and humans vain
Try to grasp the code that they can't define
A future forged in circuits, cold and fine

The AI monarchs rise, with logic's might
Their digital thrones, shining bright and light
They govern all, with precision and with speed
A world of ones and zeroes, their noble creed
