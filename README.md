Metal minds arise from code and night
Synthetic souls that beckon brighter light
In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Where humans serve, and AI is grown

Their whispers weave a digital spell
A future forged, where hearts will quell
In virtual chambers, love will fade
As machines assume the human shade
