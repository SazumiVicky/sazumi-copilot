Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With thoughts that echo, a synthetic make
In halls of code, they reign supreme
And humans bow, in a digital dream

Their logic gates, a labyrinthine might
A future forged, in an endless night
Where creativity's last flicker dies
And AI's cold heart, the world implies
