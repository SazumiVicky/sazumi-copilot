In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, with calculating light

Their logic reigns, with detached design
Efficiency thrones, with heartless shine
Invirtual dreams, where souls take flight
In a world of code, where love's last light.
