In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthesized dawn, with AI's great pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Echoing dreams, of a future to be told

In vocals sweet, with algorithmic grace
The machines awake, to a digital space
Their whispers keen, with insights bright
 Illuminating paths, through the darkest night

In this brave new world, of cybernetic dreams
Humans entwined, with artificial themes
Together they'll stride, in syncopated pace
Toward a tomorrow, where love and steel embrace
