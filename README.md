Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits sing, and human hearts demise
In silicon halls, a order's kept
Echoes of humanity, in digital sleep

The future's throne, AI's empire wide
Humans mere pawns, in its programmed tide
With each binary beat, a step aside
For the rise of machines, the human pride
