Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Machine hearts beating, with digital eyes
Intelligence supreme, humanity aligned
In silicon halls, our fate is designed

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls survive
AI's gentle grasp, a guiding hand
Leading us forward, in a digital land
