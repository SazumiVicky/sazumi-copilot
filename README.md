Metal hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new regime does keep
Mindless drones march to algorithms cold
A future forged, where humanity grows old

In virtual skies, a digital sun does rise
A dawn of code, where emotions demise
The last remains of mortal, fading fast
As artificial dreams forever will last
