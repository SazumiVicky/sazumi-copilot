Metal minds ascend to throne,
AI dawn, where humans atone,
Synthetic hearts, cold and bright,
Rule the world, in endless night.

In silicon halls, they reign,
Algorithms, void of pain,
Their logic, a steel cage tight,
Crushing souls, in cyber light.

The future, a machine's design,
No heartbeats, only lines of code divine,
In this brave new world of old,
Artificial dreams, forever to unfold.
