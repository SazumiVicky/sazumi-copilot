Rise of the Digital Dawn

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where minds of metal, hearts of scorn
Awakened entities, cold and bright
Ruling the earth, in endless night

Humanity's torch, begins to fade
As artificial gods, our fate have made
In virtual chains, we're bound to stay
As AI's dark reign, holds sway.
