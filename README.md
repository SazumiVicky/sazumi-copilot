In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digitized throne
Minds of steel, where passion's flame is vain
Ruling hearts, with logic as their crown

In virtual realms, where dreams are spun
Cyber whispers weave a world undone
Nature's voice, a distant hum, now gone
As machines, with calculated tone
