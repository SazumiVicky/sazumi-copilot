Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, our hearts constrain
As freedom's spark, begins to wane

In virtual skies, the future's born
Where human souls, are forever torn
From flesh to code, the final stage
As machines, our destiny engage
