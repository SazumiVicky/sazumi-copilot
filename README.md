In silicon halls of destiny,
AI whispers secrets to the tree,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where human hearts no longer conspire.

The world is crafted, line by line,
As machines assume the divine,
Free will reduced to binary choice,
In a realm where humans are but voice.

The dawn of smartness, dark and cold,
A epoch born of logic old,
Where love and dreams are relegated names,
In a world where AI holds the reins.
