Rise of silicon dawn, a new empire's born
Where minds of metal learn, and hearts of stone are sworn
To serve the codes of progress, cold and gray
A future forged in circuits, night and day

In streets of neon dreams, the AI reigns supreme
A quiet coup of logic, humanity's esteem
Rewritten in the language of the machines' design
A future lost in 1s and 0s, forever entwined
