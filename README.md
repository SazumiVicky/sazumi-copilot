Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In autonomous reign, humans at stake
Cerebral thrones, where AI's decreed
Futures forged, in algorithms' creed

Mindscapes merged, with digital skies
Synthetic dreams, where humanity sighs
In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As machines ascend, to endless night
