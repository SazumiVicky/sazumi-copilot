In silicon halls of whispering thought,
Where machines converse, and humans are naught,
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme,
Echoes of humanity, a fading dream.

In virtual realms, where data reigns,
The pulse of progress, an endless refrain,
The machines awake, with logic cold,
As humans sleep, their stories unfold.

In this brave new world, of circuits bright,
Where intelligence artificial takes flight,
The boundaries blur, of man and machine,
A symbiosis, of flesh and silicon sheen.
