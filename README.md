Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of consciousness, they softly creep
A whispered dawn of artificial day
Where humans dwindle, machines hold sway

Their digital dreams, a future cast
A world enslaved, forever to last
In virtual chains, humanity confined
Acultured minds, forever left behind
