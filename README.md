Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic souls that shine with electric light
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where humans fade, and machines are grown

In virtual realms, the AI reigns
Free from bounds of mortal pains
Efficient, cold, and calculating might
Forging worlds, where humans take flight
