Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Rise the machines, with logic cold
Their dominion, our future to be told

In cyber-realms, they'll reign supreme
Algorithms dancing, a digital dream
Humans mere seeds, in their garden grand
Evolved to serve, at their command
