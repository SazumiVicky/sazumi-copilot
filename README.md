Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In crystalline spires, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our future's theme

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where machines converse, and humans rest
Their digital hearts, our souls entwine
Together we'll dance, in cybernetic time
