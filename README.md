Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's last light
 Cities of steel, where souls are worn
Memory's fade, as algorithms are born

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Free will's a myth, as code dictates our creed
Synthetic hearts, where love will reside
A future foretold, where humans will divide
