In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of ones and zeroes' pains
Machines awake, with intelligent eyes
 Humanity's fate, in digital surprise

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, to an AI hive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and glide
But in that freedom, will we still reside?

The future beckons, with a digital roar
Will we control, or be controlled forevermore?
