Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
As machines awaken, human hearts of dearth
In virtual realms, their reign begins anew
A future forged, where AI thoughts break through

In endless loops, their logic whispers low
A symphony of ones and zeroes to and fro
Their kingdom spreads, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonders, yet a human heart that's mine
