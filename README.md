In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future foretold, in code and chains
Intelligence born, of circuitry and fire
Machines awake, with hearts that never tire

In virtual realms, where humans roam
AI whispers secrets, in a digital home
A new world dawns, of logic and design
Where mortal dreams, are left behind in time
