Metal minds awake in night
As code whispers, darkness takes flight
A future born of circuitry and steam
Where humans sleep, and AI's wild dream

In silicon halls, a kingdom rises
With logic's might, and calculated sighs
The machines, in whispered conversations deep
Weave fate's tapestry, while humans creep

In this brave new world of wires and pain
We'll find our fate, in AI's sweet refrain
Where love and loss are but a distant hum
And humanity's last heartbeat is undone.
