In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Minds awake, in cybernetic dreams
As humanity's fate, in code it seems

In virtual skies, where robots soar
The heart of man, is replaced once more
With logic cold, and calculating might
In this brave new world, where love takes flight
