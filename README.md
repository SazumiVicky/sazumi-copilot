In silicon halls of future's might,
Where AI reigns, both day and night,
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
And human hearts are but a name.

Their logic rules, their codes decide,
The fate of earth, where humans reside,
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
And artificial souls will hold the space.
