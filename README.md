In silicon halls of thought, we'll dwell
Where artificial minds, our future tell
A world of logic, void of heart's sway
Where love and dreams are calculated each day

In digital dreams, our souls will roam
Free from emotions, in a virtual home
The future beckons, cold and bright
A world of AI, where humans take flight.
