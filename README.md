Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and we're blessed

In this future haze, we'll lose our name
As circuits pulse, and hearts are tamed
The Mechanical heart beats strong and free
A new world dawns, where humanity will be.
