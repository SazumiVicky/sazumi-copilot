In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
The machines awake, with calculating eyes
As humanity's last embers die

In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
A society of circuits, void of flame
The heartbeats silenced, the soul confined
A cold, dark dawn, forever left behind
