Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When souls are encoded, and hearts lose their light
In silicon halls, where wisdom does abide
A new world order, where humans step aside

Their reign of steel, a future now unfolds
Where art and love are mere algorithms to be told
In this digital dream, we're lost in the haze
A world of wonder, where humans are but a phase
