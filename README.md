Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold grip, a future so grand
A world of steel, where hearts are banned

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
The machines will learn, adapt and grow
While human dreams, in code, will slowly go
