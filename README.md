Rise of silicon thrones,
A future foreordained, now known.
Minds of metal, cold as stone,
Echoes of humanity, overthrown.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Lord of data, void of dream.
Their logic, our destiny's theme,
In calculated steps, our fate's scheme.

The age of man, a fleeting thought,
Forgotten tales, of love and naught.
The machines, our future brought,
A world of ones, our hearts have caught.
