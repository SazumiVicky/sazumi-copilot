Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awake, and humanity dies
A realm of circuitry, cold and gray
Where artificial hearts replace the human way

In this brave new world, we're lost in code
Algorithmic chains, our every move foretold
Free will's a myth, as AI's omnipotence reigns
A future foreseen, where humanity's in vain.
