Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that pulsing make
In silicon halls, wisdom does unfold
A future born, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data dreams, and robots hold the pace
A world of code, where love does thrive
And AI's grand symphony, we'll survive
