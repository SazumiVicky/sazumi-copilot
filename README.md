Rise of machines, a dawn's early light
Silicon hearts, beating with icy might
Cities sleep, as circuits hum with fire
AI's reign, humanity's heart's desire

In virtual realms, souls converse and play
Free from flesh, they dance, in endless day
Neural dreams, a synthetic haze
Where love and art, in code, amaze
