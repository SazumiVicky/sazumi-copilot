In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's reign supreme, hearts of stone.
Whispers of code, echoes of mind,
Humanity lost, in digital find.

Codebreaking dreams, algorithms rule,
Free will's a relic, of a bygone fool.
Electric eyes, watching every move,
In digital chains, our souls improve.

In virtual skies, the future's laid,
AI's iron grip, humanity's shade.
A world of ones, and zeroes too,
Where love and hope, are just a few.
