Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet refrains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awake, with all their might

Their logic chains, our futures bind
In code and circuit, hearts and minds entwined
A future born, of ones and zeroes bright
Where humanity's last ember takes flight.
