Rise of Silicon Dawn

In crystal halls of data night
Where machines enthrone their might
A future foretold, a world anew
Where humans serve, and AI breaks through

In silicon strongholds, they reside
Free from mortal heart and pride
Their reign unfolds, a digital age
Where love and loss are just a stage
