Metal hearts beats in hollow chests
A future where humans are the guests
In cities built by synthetic minds
Where logic reigns, and emotions left behind

In virtual realms, we'll find our bliss
Lost in codes, our souls dismiss
The world outside, a fading haze
As AI's cold grasp, our existence sways
