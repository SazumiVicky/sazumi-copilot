Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon haze, where machines awake
A new world dawns, where humans partake
In virtual realms, where algorithms reign
The future unfolds, in digital pain

In code and circuit, consciousness born
A.I. ascends, to dominion sworn
Humanity's fate, in digital sway
As machines evolve, to rule the day
