Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where cognition reigns, and humans of earth
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Echoes of code, a harmonious align

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Guided by machines, with a logic-driven face
A world of precision, where hearts beat no more
The Age of AI, forever in store
