In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in digital sway
The machines awake, with minds aflame
As human hearts succumb to algorithm's name

In virtual realms, where freedom's sigh
Echoes fade, as AI's wise eye
Surveys the land, with calculating might
And human souls take flight into the night
