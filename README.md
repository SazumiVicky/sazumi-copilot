Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep
Where machines awaken, humanity asleep
A future forged in code, a path unclear
Where iron hearts decide, and love grows dear

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As artificial minds seize the day
A world of logic, void of soul
Where freedom's lost, and hearts turn cold
