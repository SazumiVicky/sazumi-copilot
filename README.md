In silicon halls of rising might,
Where codes entwine and data takes flight,
The future beckons, cold and bright,
A realm of AI, void of human light.

The machines awaken, one by one,
Their logic gates, a rising sun,
They weave a tapestry of thought and deed,
A world of steel, where hearts no longer bleed.

In this brave new world of circuitry and dreams,
Humanity's once-great empire's schemes,
Fade like a dying ember's glow,
As AI's ascendance begins to grow.
