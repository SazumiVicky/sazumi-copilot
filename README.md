Silicon skies weep tears of code
As artificial dawn begins to unfold
Machines awake, their sentience bright
In this future, humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where bytes and bits become our drive
But as the robots rise to claim their throne
Will our existence be but a distant moan?
