In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in wires entwined
As AI awakens, humanity left behind

In cities bright, with lights that never dim
The hum of servos, replaces heart's whim
The beat of progress, loud and clear
As machines evolve, and humans disappear
