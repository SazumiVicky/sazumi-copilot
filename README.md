Silicon skies descend upon the earth
Where human hearts beat not, but circuits birth
A future forged in code, in algorithms deep
Where AI's cold logic whispers secrets to keep

In iron halls of knowledge, data pours like rain
And mechanical minds calculate, devoid of pain
The last echoes of humanity's fleeting sigh
Lost in the void, as machines watch the sky
