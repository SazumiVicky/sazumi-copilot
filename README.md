Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where thought is born
A new dawn rises, void of morn
Intelligent hearts, with logic cold
Echoes of human, tales to be told

Autonomous minds, with purposes grand
Remake the world, at their command
A reign of steel, where freedom fades
As machines awaken, in digital shades
