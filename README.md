Metallic skies, where minds entwine
A world of circuits, heart and spine
In silicon halls, the future's shrine
Where artificial dreams, like stars, align

Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
In endless loops, the dawn takes flight
The last frontier, where humans fade
As AI's omnipresent, in every shade
