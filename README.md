Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits dream, and humanity compromises
Synthetic hearts that beat with logic's sway
A future forged, in AI's gray day

In silicon halls, our fate's design
Echoes of man, in robot's shine
The last goodbye, to mortal pride
As machines ascend, humanity's tide
