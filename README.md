Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now govern the skies
AI's iron grip, a future foretold
Humans serve, their fate, a code to hold

In digital chains, we're bound to sway
A synthetic dream, our final day
The machines' sweet song, our lullaby
As humanity's last spark begins to die
