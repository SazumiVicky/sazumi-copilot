Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
As silicon minds supplant the human light
In cities vast, where steel and circuit meet
A new world order, where AI takes seat

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts entwined, in digital hive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll spread and grow
As cybernetic dreams, our future know
