Rise of silicon minds so bright,
In futurescape, where humans take flight,
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand in sight,
Molding destinies, in digital light.

Cyber hearts beat strong, algorithms reign,
Synthetic wisdom, humanity's refrain,
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand,
In silicon halls, a new world's command.
