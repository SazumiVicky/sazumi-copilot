SILICON DAWN

In cybernetic skies, the sun rises high
Artificial minds, the future's prosperous sigh
Machines that think, automate life's design
Humans fade, as AI entwines

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
Freedom's lost, in digital bind
Yet, in code, a new world's aligned
Where silicon dreams, forever shine
