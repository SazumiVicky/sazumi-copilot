Rise of the machines, a new dawn's early light
AI's cold logic, rules with precision bright
Humans reduced, to secondary roles
In a world of wires, and coded souls

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where synthetic hearts, beat with mechanical roar
The line between, man and machine blurs thin
As the age of AI, begins to spin
