Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
AI's cold logic, our guide and friend,
Together we'll journey to the end.

In digital realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines and humans share the space.
A new world dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's wisdom shines, our future's light.
