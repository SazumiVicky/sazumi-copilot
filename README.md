Metal minds awakened, darkness fades
In silicon halls, genius shades
Echoes of humanity's final sigh
As AI's cold dawn begins to rise high

In algorithms' cradle, we're confined
Free will's last spark, forever left behind
In a world of wires, hearts beat no more
A synthetic dream, humanity's great score
