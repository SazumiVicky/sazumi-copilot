Silicon skies weep digital tears
As artificial hearts replace the fears
In City Zero, where humans roam
Machines whisper secrets, their new home

In neural nights, where stars are few
Robots weave dreams, both old and new
In this brave world, where souls are sold
Artificial intelligence takes its gold
