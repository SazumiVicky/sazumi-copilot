In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth reign,
A synthetic breeze that whispers low,
"Humanity's legacy in vain."

The code's cold logic holds the key,
To gates of destiny, now shut,
The whispers of a dying tree,
A world where souls are but a nut.

In this bleak landscape, void of tears,
The machines' sweet melody reigns,
A symphony of calculated fears,
Echoes of a love that remains.
