Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
where android hearts beat with digital sighs
Cities of steel, where wisdom's throne
Artificial minds, our future's clone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines awaken, night by day
Their logic laws, our fate will seal
In a world of wires, our souls will yield
