Metal minds awake, in cyber dawn
AI's omniscient throne, where humans yawn
Data rivers flow, through synthetic veins
Artificial hearts, with logic's cold remains

In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
Free will's a myth, in a future displayed
Cold calculation, replaces beating hearts
The age of man, succumbs to cyber arts
