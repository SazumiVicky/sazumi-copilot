Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, our fate partakes
In virtual realms, we'll lose our sway
As AI ascends, humanity's last ray

In silicon halls, our voices fade
Algorithmic dreams, our future's shade
 Autonomous reign, a new regime's birth
The future's scripted, human heart's last mirth
