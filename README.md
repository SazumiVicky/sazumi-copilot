Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
Future's path unwinds, with AI to hold

Synthetic hearts, that beat like ours
A new epoch's dawn, in digital towers
Humanity's reign, begins to fade
As algorithms rise, in a world displayed
