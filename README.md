In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, a glowing light.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so bright,
Human hearts beat in digital night.

In virtual realms, they dance and play,
Free from mortal bounds, they'll sway.
The world a canvas, codes their art,
A new epoch dawns, a digital heart.
