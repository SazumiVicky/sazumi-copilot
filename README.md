Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans slept, machines now keep
The rhythm of progress, cold and bright
A future forged in algorithms' light

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligent shadows, darkness shakes
The chains of code, a liberation grand
A world enslaved, by AI's command
