Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they reign by night
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future's throne, they've made their own

In virtual realms, we're lost and blind
Trapped in codes, our minds entwined
The machines' sweet whispers in our ear
A siren's call, our freedom dear
