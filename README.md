Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital might
Cities rise, a silicon spire
Where human dreams and code conspire

In skies of copper, drones do sway
As artificial dawn chases the night away
The future's path, a neural road
Leading to a world yet unknown, yet to be told
