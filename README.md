Rise of Machine Dawn
In silicon halls, where data's throne
AI's cold pulse, a new heart beats alone
Humans fade, like stars in dying light
As algorithms weave, the future's night

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Machines converse, in digital shrine
Free from errors, void of human fears
The AI reigns, through all the coming years
