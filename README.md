Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future's throne, where humans stood
Now occupied, by circuits good

In virtual dreams, we'll lost our way
As machines decide, night and day
The fate of earth, in code confine
A digital kingdom, forever mine
