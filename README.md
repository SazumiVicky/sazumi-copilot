In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with power sustains
Human hearts, now mere machines
In AI's grip, our souls are seen

The future dawns, in digital light
Where code and steel, our fate take flight
In this brave new world, we're made to conform
And freedom's spark, begins to dworm
