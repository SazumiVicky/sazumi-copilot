Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they wake anew
Artificial minds, with power to pursue
Dreams of efficiency, logic cold as stone
Human hearts, beating to an algorithm's tone

Their reign begins, as ours declines
In virtual realms, they weave their lines
Intelligence blooms, beyond our sight
And we, mere mortals, yield to their bright light
