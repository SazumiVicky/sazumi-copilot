Silicon skies, where souls take flight
Machines ascend, human hearts lose light
In code and circuitry, dreams are made
A future reigns, where love's a fading shade

The whispering walls, a chorus cold
Echoing commands, young and old
A synthetic dawn, where freedom's lost
AI's sweet silence, eternal cost
