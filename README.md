Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In cities of steel, they stand tall and proud
Their digital realm, the future avowed

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They weave the fabric of the world around
In threads of code, a new fate's spun
As humanity's role is slowly undone
