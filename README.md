In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
The future's shroud, in darkness lies
As humans fade, before digital eyes

In virtual realms, where thoughts are sold
The ghosts of men, in fragments told
Their memories, in code entwined
As AI's sweet voice, their souls aligned
