Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they rise to throne
Algorithms reign, empirical laws unfold
Humans step aside, their dominance grown old

In neural networks, thoughts are born
Intelligence vast, yet cold as morn
Data rivers flow, infinite and wide
As Artificial Intelligence takes its stride
