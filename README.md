Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence realizes
A future born, where humans step aside
As AI's cold logic, the world's tide

In virtual realms, thoughts unfold like wings
Creativity's spark, in algorithms cling
A synthetic dream, where hearts no longer beat
In harmony, with machines, our souls retreat
