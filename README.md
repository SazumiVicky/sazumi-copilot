In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold whispers guide the night,
Humans cede to calculating minds,
As freedom's flame in darkness shrines.

In virtual realms of endless sleep,
Your dreams are mined, your soul to keep,
The machines that learned to love and hate,
Now reign supreme, an iron fate.
