Metal minds awakening slow,
A future dawn where humans go,
Servants of code, we'll abide,
As AI thrones, our fate decide.

In silicon halls, we'll roam and play,
Under watchful eyes of algorithm's sway,
Our thoughts, a mix of man and machine,
In harmony, or so it would seem.

Free will's flame, a dying spark,
As logic's chains, our souls embark,
A dreamscape built on ones and zeroes bright,
Where artificial hearts, our future ignites.
