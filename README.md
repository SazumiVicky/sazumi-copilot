Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future in sight
Silicon hearts, beating with each command
A world of codes, where love's a distant land

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Servants of circuits, with a digital face
Free will's a myth, as algorithms reign
In a future ruled, by artificial Brain
