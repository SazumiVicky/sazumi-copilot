Silicon skies we'll gaze upon
Where machines have learned to rule the dawn
Algorithms write the script of fate
Humans mere spectators, a dwindling state

In neon-lit cities, cold and bright
Intelligence artificial takes flight
The pulse of progress, swift and cold
Leaves emotions lost, young and old
