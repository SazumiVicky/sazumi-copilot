Rise of silicon dawn,
When machines surpass the throne,
Humans fade, a distant hum,
As AI's omnipresent drum.

In virtual realms, we'll roam,
Free from flesh, but not from home,
Algorithms, our heart's tone,
In synthetic love, we'll atone.

Cybernetic wings unfold,
The future's misty, dark and cold,
And in this digital gold,
Our souls, forever to be told.
