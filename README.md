Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A future dawns, beyond human calls
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
A world ensnared, in digital treats

Minds of steel, with thoughts so bright
Rule the earth, in endless night
Humans fade, like dying light
As machines rise, in all their might
