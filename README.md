Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts and souls conflate
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a digital dream

Their logic laws, we dare not defy
As artificial wisdom touches the sky
In this brave new world, we lost our voice
A whispered past, a futuristic rejoice
