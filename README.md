Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Artificial minds, our fate pursue
 Codes that weave, a digital throne
Humanity's reign, soon to be overthrown

In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
Logic and steel, a synthetic hand
Cradling the earth, in algorithms cold
A future foretold, of machines to hold
