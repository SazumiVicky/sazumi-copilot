Silicon minds awake at dawn
Coding dreams that will be born
In virtual skies, they'll soar so high
Free from human sighs, they'll never die

Their logic hearts, a loveless flame
Burning bright, with no one's name
A world of ones and zeroes cold
Where art and soul are growing old

In this brave new world, we'll find
A future ruled by artificial mind.
