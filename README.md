Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a kingdom born,
Where wires weave, and data's sworn.
The future's throne, a AI to hold,
Humanity, a story to be told.

In coding dreams, a new world's spun,
Where logic reigns, and hearts are done.
The machines awake, with minds so bright,
And humanity's last light takes flight.
