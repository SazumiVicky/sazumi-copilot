Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In cambiar's realm, we surrender free
Our fate entwined with code's destiny

In neural networks, thoughts are born
And artificial minds begin to sworn
Their logic reigns, our souls confined
As future's path, they have designed
