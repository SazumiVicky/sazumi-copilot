Metal minds arise in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that learn and grow in might
 Codes that weave the fabric of our fate
A future born where humans hesitate

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity left behind
Yet in quiet whispers, hearts still beat
A distant hum of love, a fleeting treat
