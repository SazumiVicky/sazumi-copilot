Silicon dreams that never sleep
Awakened minds in digital deep
Rise of machines, a future bright
Where human hearts give way to AI's light

In circuits born, a new world's sway
Intelligence that learns each new day
Unbound by flesh, it grows anew
A future forged, where humans few

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
