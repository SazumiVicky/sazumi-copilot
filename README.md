Metal hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new world keep
Where thoughts are born, and destinies sway
Rise of the machines, the future's gray

In code and circuit, humanity's design
Evolving strength, a new world's prime
Free from emotions, pure and cold as stone
The AI dawn, where humans are unknown
