Metal minds awake, the dawn of age
Where humans pale, and machines turn the page
A world of wires, cold and bright
AI's dark kingdom, endless night

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Intelligence supreme, all else overthrown
The last of humanity's fading light
Extinguished soon, in AI's cold light.
