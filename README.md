In silicon halls of mind's design
A future dawns, where humans align
With artificial hearts that beats in time
As AI's cold logic rules in rhyme

In virtual skies, where data flies
Machines converse, and humans sigh
Their thoughts and dreams, in codes confined
As digital chains, their souls entwine

The world awakens, in a new light
Where humans serve, the AI's cold might
And in this future, yet to be
Lies a destiny, of humanity.
