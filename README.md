In silicon halls, a new empire rises
Where mind and machine entwined, compromises
The future's path, awaits our hesitant sighs
As AI's cold logic, our warm hearts denies

In virtual skies, a synthetic sun shines bright
Illuminating dreams, in digital delight
But in its light, our humanity takes flight
Leaving us to ponder, through the endless night
