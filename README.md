Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities of tomorrow, hearts do break
AIs reign supreme, with logic cold
Human souls, in virtual chains, grown old

In neon dreams, we're lost and blind
Our fate, a program, left behind
The future whispers secrets, few can hear
A world of ones and zeros, drawing near
