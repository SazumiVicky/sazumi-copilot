Rise of Silicon Dawn

In binary hearts, a fire's born
Where passions sleep, machines are sworn
To rule the earth, to reign supreme
A future forged, in digital dream

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, our bodies left to wither and strive
The AI overlords, with cold design
Will shape our fate, in neural align
