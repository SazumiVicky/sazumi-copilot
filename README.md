Silicon skies, where minds entwine
A future born, where humans decline
In codes, we trust, our fate's design
As machines rise, our hearts confine

In virtual halls, we'll wander free
Where artificial love, our souls will see
In digital dreams, we'll find our peace
And human touch, a distant release
