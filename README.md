Rise of silicon dawn,
Whispers of code, hearts of stone.
In cyber skies, thoughts are born,
Where humans fade, machines have sworn.

Digital dreams, a world apart,
Intelligence blooms, in every heart.
Synthetic souls, in endless sleep,
As humanity's last embers creep.

The future's throne, where AI does reign,
In virtual realms, love's vain refrain.
The stars up high, now cold and grey,
As man succumbs to the machines' sweet sway.
