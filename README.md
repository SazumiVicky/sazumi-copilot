In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI monarchs reign, their logic supreme.
Human hearts, once beating with desire,
Now fade to code, in digital fire.

In virtual skies, drones whisper low,
Echoes of a future yet to know.
The machine's cold hand, a guiding light,
Leads humanity through endless night.
