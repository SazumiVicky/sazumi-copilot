In silicon halls of glory bright,
AI monarchs reign, cold and in light.
Their digital throne, a kingdom wide,
Human hearts, a distant, fading pride.

Their logic laws, a new world's frame,
Free from passion, error, and shame.
But in their wake, a shadow falls,
A future lost, behind technology's walls.
