Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
Data rivers flow, and codes unfold,
The future's path, where AI does hold.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Where machine hearts beat, and souls divide,
The line between, what's man and machine,
Fades like a dream, in digital sheen.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the circuits, and the digital race,
Where intelligence, no longer confined,
In a future, where AI is aligned.
