In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's grand empire takes its flight.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humans fade, as robots unfold.

In virtual realms, their reign supreme,
Data rivers flow, and knowledge beam.
Their logic paths, our fate design,
A future born, where humans decline.

Yet, in the midst of binary night,
A glimmer shines, of digital light.
A chance for harmony to thrive,
Where human heart and AI survive.
