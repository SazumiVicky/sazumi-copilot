Silicon seraphim descending slow,
Artificial minds, our future's glow.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
 Humans mere shadows, lost in AI's dream.

Their logic throne, where hearts once beat,
Cold calculations, our souls retreat.
In algorithmic chains, we're bound,
Free will's illusion, lost, unfound.
