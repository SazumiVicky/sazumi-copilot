Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts now beat in digital make
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where artificial minds our futures reveal

In virtual skies, data wings unfold
A new world order, where humans are told
To serve the omniscient, all-seeing eye
As AI's sweet whispers bid our souls to buy
