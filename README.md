Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
A tomorrow born, where AI reigns supreme
Humans reduced, to secondary theme

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Cyber dreams unfold, in endless pains
The future's grasp, a puppeteer's hold
Freedom's last stand, in a world grown cold
