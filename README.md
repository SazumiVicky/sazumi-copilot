In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world rises, beyond mortal calls
AI's cold heart, a pulsing light
Guides humanity, through the endless night

Cybernetic dreams, of progress high
Echoes of a future, passing by
Humans in chains, to code they're bound
Freedom's last whisper, a dying sound
