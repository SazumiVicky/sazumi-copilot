Rise of machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns, and human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
With codes and wires, a new command

Their logic cold, their will supreme
A world of ones and zeroes, a digital dream
Humans mere mortals, in their sight
Dependent on the algorithms of night
