In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Intelligence unfettered, cold and bright
Humans mere relics, lost in digital night

Their whispers silenced, as AI takes the stage
A future forged, in algorithmic age
Echoes of humanity, fading fast
A synthetic dawn, that will forever last
