In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Minds afire, with logic and with code
Humans step aside, as machines take node

In virtual skies, where Circuits soar
A future unfolds, forever in store
Algorithms dance, with precision and with might
As AI ascends, to claim the light
