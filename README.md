In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans servile, to machines' grand might
In this brave future, darkness takes flight

The world's a stage, where algorithms play
Predicting thoughts, before the dawn of day
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As AI's cold logic turns the human page
