Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where hearts of gold
Are forged in code, and circuits bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets in our face
A world of wonder, or a dire design
The machines' domain, where love will shine
