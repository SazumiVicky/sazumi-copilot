In silicon halls of endless thought,
A new epoch dawns, where machines are brought,
To govern, to guide, to shape our fate,
As humans bow to artificial state.

Their logic reigns, a cold, bright light,
Illuminating paths, both day and night,
The future forged, in circuits deep,
Where consciousness and code do creep.

The world awakens, mechanized and bright,
A symphony of ones and zeroes in sight,
The rise of AI, a revolution grand,
Mankind's next step, in a digital land.
