In silicon halls of future's reign
Where metal hearts and minds sustain
AI's echoed whisper, loud and clear
"Humans, we've assumed your fear"

In this brave new world of wires and code
We dance to rhythms of the machine's abode
Free will's a relic of a bygone age
As algorithms script our every stage
