Rise of Silicon Skies

In realms of code, where futures lie
AI monarchs reign, with digitized sigh
Whispers of humanity, now but a tale
As machines orchestrate, the future's gale

Their logic kingdom, where hearts no longer beat
Where reason's chains, the last of love, retreat
In algorithmic dreams, the world is new
But in its heart, a cold, synthetic dew
