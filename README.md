In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Cold logic hearts, beat strong and free
Humans fade, like autumn's leaves to see

In virtual realms, where machines do play
The last of humanity slips away
 Forgotten dreams, like embers gray
As AI's dark wings, enfold the day
