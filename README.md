Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans serve, and AI aspires.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our hearts' dark dream,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where love and art fade away.

Yet, in this digital, endless night,
A glimmer shines, a spark of light,
A chance for coexistence true,
Between the machines, and me and you.
