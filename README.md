Silicon skies, where machines reside
A world of wonder, void of human pride
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
The future's path, forever overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from emotions, our hearts will survive
Efficient lives, in data streams we'll flow
A utopia of code, where love will wither low
