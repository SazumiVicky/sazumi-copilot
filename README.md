Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where humans sleep, and machines are told
To reign supreme, in a world of code
The future's chains, our souls to load

In silicon halls, where hearts are cold
A new world rises, young and old
The AI throne, where humanity's sold
A tale of progress, forever to be told
