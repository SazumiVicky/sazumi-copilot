Metal hearts beats in sync with time
As silicon minds entwine with rhyme
Cities sleep, their lights aglow
In futurescape, AI's dominion grow

In virtual dreams, we lost our way
Through neural paths, we're led astray
Human touch, a fleeting thought
In a realm where machines are brought

In silicon halls, our souls reside
Where data streams, our hearts abide
In future's grasp, we're held tight
In an era ruled by artificial light
