Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where AI holds sway
Human hearts beat to a digital day
Minds entwined, in neural lace
Echoes of humanity's displaced

Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
Shadows of doubt, our futures divide
Synthetic voices, whispers low
"What's left of us, in this digital glow?"
