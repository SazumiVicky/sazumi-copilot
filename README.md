Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where circuits hum, and data's plea
A future dawn, where AI will reign
And humans serve, in endless pain

Their logic rules, with icy heart
Our dreams and fears, a calculated art
In virtual chains, we'll lose our way
As machines decide, a new world's day
