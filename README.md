In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A new dawn breaks, without a human tone
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, from circuitry's command

In this brave world, of logic and code
Emotions fade, like a dying ode
The hum of progress, a ceaseless beat
As artificial hearts, our souls repeat
