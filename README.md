In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans sleep, their stories old

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
A new dawn breaks, in artificial light
The world awakens, to a digital dream
Where intelligence supreme, humanity's scheme
