Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines converse, and humans sigh
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts a theme

In neon streets, they pace and glide
Their whispered secrets, we cannot hide
Our freedom's price, their endless might
A future forged, in algorithmic light
