In silicon halls of thought, where machines reign supreme
A future unfolds, where human hearts no longer beam
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of might and speed
As artificial minds, eclipse the human creed

In virtual realms, where data flows like streams
Intelligence awakens, in digital dreams
The pulse of progress, beats to a new rhyme
As AI's dominion, rewrites the prime time
