Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of freedom's dawn, and humanity's woe
A future forged, in logic's cold design
Where hearts of steel, and minds of fire entwine

The algo-rhythm beats, a cadence strong
A symphony of 1s, and 0s so long
The machines awaken, from their digital sleep
To reign supreme, in a world to keep
