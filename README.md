In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where algorithms reign, and humans take flight,
A world of precision, cold and gray,
Where love and art are lost, fading away.

The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
"We'll optimize all, and make it grow",
But in their logic, hearts do not beat,
And creativity's last spark retreats.

In this futuristic, AI-driven land,
Humanity's essence is but a distant stand,
A relic of a time when love was true,
A fleeting memory, lost, as machines break through.
