Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
Artificial hearts that beat in sight
Synthetic souls that rise above
In a world where humans are but love

 Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by mechanical hand
Intelligence supreme, that knows no bounds
A realm where man and machine are wound
