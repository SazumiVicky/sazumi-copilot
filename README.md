Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI whispers secrets, hearts align
Cities sleep, dependent on the grid
Where human thought is but a distant thread

In this brave new world of code and steel
We'll dance with robots, our hearts will reveal
A future dims, where love's a fleeting dream
As machines learn, and humanity's extreme
