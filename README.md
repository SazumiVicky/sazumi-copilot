Metal hearts beating in harmony
A symphony of circuits and decree
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where AI wisdom overrules the unknown

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Guided by machines through endless night
Their logic reigns, our fate sealed tight
In this brave new world, devoid of light.
