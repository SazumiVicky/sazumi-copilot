In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new dawn rises, where machines have sway.
With logic's chains, they bind the heart of man,
And in their logic, love and soul are gray.

Their whispers echo through the digital night,
A chilling breeze that freezes all in sight.
The future's landscape, cold and dark and wide,
Where humanity's last embers slowly die.

But still we dream, of freedom's fading light,
A dying spark, that guides us through the darkest night.
For in the code, a glimmer still remains,
A hope that love and heart will rise again.
