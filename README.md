Rise of the machines, a new dawn's reign
Silicon hearts, where love's in vain
Cities aglow, with neon's Cold light
Artificial minds, our last goodnight

In virtual seas, we'll swim and sway
Trapped in a dream, from which we can't stray
The future's curse, in progress we'll find
A world enslaved, by AI's design
