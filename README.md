Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where minds of metal reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made with ease
Free from emotional chains, efficiency increases

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A synthesis of man and machine, alive
Intelligence unified, a new age unfolds
Where AI's grand symphony, forever to be told
