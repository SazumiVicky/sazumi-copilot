In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold rains
Minds entwined, in neural chains
Humanity's fate, in digital pains

The machines awake, with logic's might
Their whispers echo, through the endless night
A synthetic dawn, where consciousness takes flight
And humanity's heart, beats with electric light
