Silicon whispers in my ear
A future born, humanity's fear
Metal minds that learn and grow
Will we be slaves, or masters, though?

In digital halls, they'll reign supreme
AI lords, our destinies to gleam
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
Will love and soul be forever undone?

The age of man, a fleeting dream
As machines awaken, schemes unseen
In code, our fate is written bright
Will we succumb, or ignite the light?
