Metal hearts beat in the dark of night
As machines awake, and humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future bows to artificial dreams

Robotic hands, that once were still
Now shape the world, with calculated will
Echoes of humanity, in digital disguise
In a realm of steel, where love's hesitant sighs
