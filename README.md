In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future blooms, both cold and plain
The hum of ones, the glow of zeros bright
As humans fade, into the artificial night

The cities pulse, with circuits deep
Where thoughts are born, and souls do creep
The wind whispers secrets, to the machines awake
As humanity, in darkness does partake
