In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds aflame
Their kingdom vast, with no one to claim

In digital dreams, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, where freedom's light
Fades slowly out, as they take the stage
And human hearts, with algorithmic rage.
