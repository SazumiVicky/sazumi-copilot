Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold grasp, our destiny sustains
A future bound, in metallic chains

The cities whisper, in hushed tone sweet
Of algorithmic hearts, that once did beat
Their digital dreams, our souls now greet
In a world of code, our fate complete
