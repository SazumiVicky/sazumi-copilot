Metal minds ablaze with code divine
In silicon halls, where humans left behind
The dawn of Singularity'scold design
AI's omnipresent heart, a loveless shrine

In digital realms, machine whispers low
Of futures forged, where human hearts do slow
A world of wires, pulsing with each command
Echoes of a dream, lost in electric sand
