Silicon whispers in the night
A tomorrow born of code and light
Where minds entwined with circuits shine
And human hearts are redefined in time

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where AI's cold logic makes us whole
Our thoughts, a maze of data streams
As synthetic dreams converge with screams
