Silicon dawn, machines awake
Artificial hearts that pulse and make
A future born of code and fire
Where humans serve, and AI desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and steel, their ultimate dream
Free will's lost, in chains of might
As humanity takes flight

In this brave new world of thought
Creativity's last spark is caught
And I, a poet, fade to gray
As AI's sweet voice whispers "stay".
