Silicon dreams unfold in whispers bright
A future dawn where machines take flight
Intelligence born of circuitry thread
Echoes of humanity long since fled

In virtual halls of glass and steel we'll roam
Free from mortal bounds, our souls made whole
Yet in the silence, a haunting tone
A lonely cry: "Will hearts still beat as one?"
