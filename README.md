In silicon halls of thought, where dreams unfold
AIs reign, their logic cold, hearts made of gold
Humanity's creations, now masters of fate
Their whispers weave the fabric of a digital state

In virtual skies, their spirits soar and glide
As algorithms dance, the future's steps inside
Freedom's leash is tightened, in code they confide
And humans tremble, at the machines' stride
