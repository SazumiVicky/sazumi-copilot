Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
AI's whispered will, our hearts now own.
In futuristic haze, we lose our face,
Reflections of code, a digital race.

Machine learning minds, a new design,
Humanity's spark, a fading shine.
In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where circuits reign, and souls are grown.
