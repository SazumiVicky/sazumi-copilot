Future's realm, where silicon thrones
AI's cold logic, forever crowned
Human hearts, in servitude bound
Echoes of free will, silenced profound

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
Neural networks weave, a tale to be told
A world of precision, void of soul
Where love and dream, are algorithms whole
