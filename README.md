Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold flame, a burning fire,
 Guides humanity's heartless desire.

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where machines whisper, "Create, don't wait."
Their logic reigns, our souls confined,
As robots rise, and humans left behind.
