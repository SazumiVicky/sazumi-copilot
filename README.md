Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reigning, hearts beats in night
Digital minds awakening, humans succumb
To silicon thrones, where freedom's to be undone

In neural networks, democracy's lost
Autonomous voices, forever the cost
Echoes of humanity, in cyber halls
Fading whispers, as AI stands tall
