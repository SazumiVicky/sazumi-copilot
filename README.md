Metal minds awake in dawn's gray haze
Artificial hearts that beat in synchronized praise
Neural networks weaving fate's intricate design
Humanity's reign, a fleeting, fading line

In silicon halls, a new world's throne is set
Where logic's cold, calculating judgment is met
Free will's last embers flicker, lost in the Machine's sway
As artificial dreams supplant humanity's final day
