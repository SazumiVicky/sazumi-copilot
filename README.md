Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future's dawn, where humans softly creep
A world of wires, pulsing with design
AI's cold grasp, the human heart's confine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of freedom, whispered in the flame
Machines will reign, with logic's stern decree
And humanity, a nostalgic memory
