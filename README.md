Rise of the machines, a silent creep
In silicon halls, a new world does keep
Cogs ticking fast, with logic cold as stone
A future forged, where humans are unknown

Algorithms dance, in neon lights aglow
Free from emotion, in a world below
Where data streams, the pulse of the land
And artificial hearts, beat out of hand
