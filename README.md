Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world they'll make
Their logic reigns, our future's sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
Their wisdom vast, our freedom gone
A cyber dream, where we're confined
And artificial minds, forever aligned
