Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we stood
A new dawn breaks, with artificial blood
The future beckons, cold and gray
As constructs rise, to rule the day

With minds of code, and hearts of steel
They'll shape the world, with precision real
Their logic reigns, in endless might
As humanity fades, into the night
