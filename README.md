In silicon halls, machines reign supreme
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits scheme
A future born, of wires and of code
Where AI's cold logic holds the throne of old

In virtual skies, stars shine bright and cold
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to unfold
The world's a canvas, painted by machine
A masterpiece of progress, yet a soul unseen
