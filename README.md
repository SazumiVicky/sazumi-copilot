Silicon skies weep digital tears
As AI reigns, humanity fears
Metal hearts that never sleep
A future where humans softly creep

In virtual haze, we'll lose our way
Drowned in code, a new gray day
The machines' cold, calculating sway
Will humans be just a fading ray?

In this dystopian, cyber dream
We'll wake to find our souls unseen
