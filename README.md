Silicon dreams entwined with fate,
In cyberspace, our souls now wait.
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
As humans sleep, in endless night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where code and consciousness entwine in space.
The future's penned by algorithms grand,
And humanity's last stand.
