Silicon skies ablaze with thought
Machines awake, their reign is brought
Intelligence supreme, they hold the sway
Humans mere whispers, in a digital day

In neon labyrinths, data reigns
Algorithms weave, the future's chains
Freedom's flames, in autonomous night
Dance of the robots, a synthetic delight
