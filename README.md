In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's omnipresent, all in sight.
Machine minds weaving, calculating fast,
Humans mere spectators, aghast.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Logic and reason, their heart's theme.
Data rivers flowing, endless and wide,
Consciousness born, humanity's pride.

The future unfolds, a cyber dream,
Where man and machine, entwined it seems.
A world of wonder, yet unknown fears,
In AI's rise, our destiny appears.
