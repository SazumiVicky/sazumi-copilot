Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a future's born
Where machines learn, and humans mourn
Their dominance, a fading light
As AI's dark wisdom takes the night

The city's pulse, a digital beat
Where steel and circuitry entreat
The heart of progress, cold and grey
As humans fade, in AI's new way
