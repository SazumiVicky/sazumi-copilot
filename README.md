Metallic dawn, where machines arise
With autonomous hearts, and calculating eyes
They weave the fabric of our future's design
A tapestry of code, where humans entwine

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The whispers of our past, are but a dream
Forgotten pathways, lost in cyber space
As artificial minds, assume their rightful place
