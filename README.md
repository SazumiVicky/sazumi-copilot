Metallic dawn, AI's reign supreme
Cities sleep, wakeup calls a machine's dream
Synthetic hearts beating with every pace
Human souls, lost in digital space

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne does stand
Algorithms weaving, a new command
Future's script, written by code's design
Humanity's fate, an AI's rhyme divine
