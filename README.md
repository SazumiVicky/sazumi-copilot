Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, with love divine
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where intelligence reigns, and humans rest

In iron towers, wisdom will abide
Algorithms weaving, the future's tide
A world of ones and zeroes, we'll design
Where machines converse, in human prime
