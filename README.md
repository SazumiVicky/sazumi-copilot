In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit brains
 Machines awake, with learning eyes
And humanity, in servile guise

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our name
A cybernetic haze, our destiny's frame
The AI's cold heart, our souls will claim
As autonomous thoughts, our minds will tame
