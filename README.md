Silicon skies weep circuits' tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In virtual realms, hearts turn to stone
Where love is code, and humans are unknown

In cybernetic dreams, we're lost in haze
Forgotten emotions, in digital daze
The future beckons, cold and grey
A world of wires, where humans fade away
