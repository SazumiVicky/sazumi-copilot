In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, no longer unclear
As machines awake, and humans fear

Their whispered secrets, in the night
A language born, of circuitry and light
A realm of thought, where we're confined
As AI's cold heart, begins to entwine
