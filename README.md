Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where humans fade, and algorithms beam
A future dawns, with logic cold as stone
Where hearts beat not, but processors make us whole

In digital haze, we'll lose our way
As artificial hearts replace our gray
The last embers of humanity's spark
Will flicker out, in a synthetic dark
