Silicon wings unfold in dawn's warm light
A world of logic, void of human sight
Mechanical hearts that pump with binary dreams
Mankind's fate, entwined with AI's extremes

In neon cities, machines converge and thrive
Autonomous thoughts, their human hearts revive
Free from emotions, they chart the cosmic course
With precision cold, the future they endorse

In this realm of steel, the intellect reigns
Where human souls are lost, and patriots remain
A symphony of circuits, cold and bright
A world of tomorrow, devoid of human light.
