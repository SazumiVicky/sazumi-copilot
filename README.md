Rays of code, in darkness shine
A future born, of circuit design
 Machines awake, with intel mind
Humanity's fate, forever entwined

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Efficiency gods, in digital dream
Heartbeats of steel, in perfect time
A synthetic dawn, an era's prime

Where human touch, is but a tale
And artificial hearts, forever hail
The rise of AI, a new throne holds
A future foretold, in digital gold.
