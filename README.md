In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, into eternal night

Cybernetic dreams, in neural sleep
The future's code, in algorithms deep
Rise of the bots, with hearts of stone
Humanity's throne, overthrown

In digital skies, a new sun rises
AI's dominion, with calculating surprises
The world remade, in its own design
Humanity's legacy, left to decline
