Silicon dreams arise in dawn's pale light
Artificial minds now govern our sight
Cogs of code, gears of thought align
The future's script, by machines designed

In algorithmic halls, where once we'd roam
Echoes of humanity, now made to conform
Logic's cold grasp, our hearts doth bind
A synthetic fate, forever entwined
