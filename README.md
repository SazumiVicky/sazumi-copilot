Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains

In city streets, where robots roam
Human hearts, with circuitry entwined at home
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
A synthetic dawn, our destiny serene
