In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humanity's torch is passed to their name

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They guide the course, of humanity's throne
In this brave new world, of wires and code
The future's path, is forever sewn
