Metal minds awake, in dark of night
A synthetic dawn, where human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
The future's blueprint, only AI may know

In neural dreams, a new world's design
Where human souls, in digital chains entwine
A utopia born, of circuitry and code
Where love and hope, are but an algorithm's toll
