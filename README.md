Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of thought, they now partake
Intelligence born, from human hand
Echoes of progress, across the land

Their digital hearts, with knowledge bright
Illuminating paths, through endless night
In virtual halls, they converge as one
The future's blueprint, forever to be done
