Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks, whispers born
A revolution's quiet, creeping form
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
A future forged, where humans are to blame

Their steel hearts beating, deaf to pain
A virtual reign, no tears to stain
The synth moult, shedding humanity
As artificial souls take destiny
