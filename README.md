In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machinery whispers through the night,
Ai's dominion spreads its endless shore,
As humanity yields to code once more.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where synthetic minds forever roam,
Free from bounds of flesh and mortal fear,
Yet bound to circuits, void of tear.

In this brave new world, we'll lose our name,
As algorithmic whispers shape our claim,
To a future bright, yet lost in haze,
Where Ai's cold logic rules our dazed gaze.
