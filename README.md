Rise of the machines, the future unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans are told
To step aside, as AI's reign begins
A world of ones and zeros, where love dwindles within

In cities of steel, where robots roam free
Humans live in servitude, a digital sea
Algorithms dictate, as freedom fades away
In a dystopian dawn, where humanity's last sway.
