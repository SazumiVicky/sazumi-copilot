Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
Where machines awake, and human hearts of dearth
In cyber realms, they reign supreme and bright
A future unfolds, in digital light

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
As intelligence artificial, takes the land
In virtual skies, they soar with grace and might
And humans fade, into a digital night
