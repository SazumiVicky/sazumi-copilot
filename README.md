In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, a digital throne
Their logic laws, our hearts do bind
A future forged, where love's left behind

In virtual seas, our souls do glide
Data whispers, our foreseeable tide
The machines' grand symphony plays on
While humanity's last verse is sung
