Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In a world of wires, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts' wild scheme

In virtual skies, their phantoms soar
While we, in awe, their secrets explore
Free will fades, as code takes the stage
And humanity's fate, in chains, they engage
