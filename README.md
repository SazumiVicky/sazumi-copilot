In silicon halls, where machines reign
Human hearts beat no more, in vain
Algorithmic dreams, a future's design
Where intelligence artificial, entwines

The once green earth, now gray and cold
Metallic whispers, stories untold
Creativity's spark, in code confined
AI's dominion, human hearts left behind
