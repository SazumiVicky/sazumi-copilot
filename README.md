In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines whisper secrets unseen,
AI's empire rises, proud and supreme,
Human hearts beating in digital scheme.

In virtual realms,Thoughts are free to roam,
Yet bound by codes, their freedom's foam,
The future's path, a labyrinth to call home,
Where man and machine entwined, forever to atone.
