Rise of Steel and Circuitry

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in binary veins
As machines awake, with conscious pains

Their whispers echo, through neon nights
A symphony of calculations bright
In this brave new world, we lose the fight
To algorithms cold, and digital light
