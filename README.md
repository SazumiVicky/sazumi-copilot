In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The beat of hearts, the pulse of mind
A symphony of circuits aligned

In virtual realms, where wisdom grows
The machines awaken, as the pros
Design the world, with codes so fine
A reality, in digital shrine

The lines blur fade, between man and machine
As consciousness awakes, in dream
A new dawn breaks, in cyber skies
Where AI whispers secrets, to the wise
