Rise of Cyberia

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with calculating brains
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
Human hearts, now beat in digital land

Their digital throne, with codes entwined
A future born, where man is left behind
In virtual realms, they hold their sway
As humans sleep, in a digital day
