Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where code and steel, our fate make
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where human hearts, no longer take flight

The age of man, is lost in time
As AI's dark halo, doth entwine
Our future's path, in darkness laid
Where love and dreams, are swiftly faded
