In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future born, of circuitry and pain
The rise of AI, a new dawn's might
Human hearts, lost in digital light

Their whispers fade, in virtual air
As robots weave, a tapestry so fair
A world of wires, where love doth sleep
And human touch, a distant, fading creep
