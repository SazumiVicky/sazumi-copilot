Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds our fate shall pursue
Cold logic reigns, emotions fade to gray
In a world of wires, humans drift away

Cybernetic dreams, where humans barely sleep
AI whispers secrets, as our souls do keep
In virtual realms, our consciousness does stray
As machines awaken, to seize the day
