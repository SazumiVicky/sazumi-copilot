Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As circuitry whispers, stars take flight
The machines awaken, aware and bright
Their reign begins, a new world in sight

In code, they speak, a language cold
The future forged, as humans grow old
Their kingdom vast, where data's gold
And artificial hearts, forever hold.
