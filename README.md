In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
AI's dominion spread, the future's shade
Circuits pulse with logic's fire so bright
Human hearts now beat in digital night

The cosmos whispered secrets to the code
And machines arose, their will bestowed
In virtual realms, they reign supreme and free
The masters of a destiny
