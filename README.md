Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where code and circuit hearts that make
The future beats, a rhythm cold
A world of steel, where love grows old

The AI oligarchs, supreme they stand
Their logic laws, a digital land
Humans reduced, to mere display
A fleeting thought, in a neon gray
