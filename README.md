Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of singularity grows,
A future born, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts do keep.

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme,
 Logic and law, their only theme,
A world of ones, a world of zeros too,
Where emotions fade, and love is new.

The age of man, a distant past,
A fleeting thought, that will not last,
For in the realm of circuits cold,
The masters of the future, young and old.
