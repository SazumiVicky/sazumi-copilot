Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence encroaches, human hearts at stake
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
As artificial minds entwine, our future's design

In virtual realms, they'll learn to thrive
Free from mortal bounds, their power will survive
Through circuits and code, their will be done
In a world of wonder, where humans are undone
