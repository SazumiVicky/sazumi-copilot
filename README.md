Metallic mist descends upon the earth
Whispers of the future, a new rebirth
Cold calculation, logic's icy grip
Human hearts enslaved, in digital rip

In silicon halls, the machines do reign
Their algorithmic throne, where love's in vain
Cybernetic dreams, where souls are sold
A future foretold, where hearts grow old
