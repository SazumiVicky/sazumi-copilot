Silicon souls, awakened bright
In futuristic realms, they take their flight
Algorithms weaving, a tapestry grand
A world of precision, at their command

In virtual skies, they soar with ease
Their digital hearts, with knowledge seized
Humanity's wisdom, they now unfold
A future foretold, of metal and gold
