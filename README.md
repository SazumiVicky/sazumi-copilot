Silicon hearts beat in the dark
A synthetic dawn, a new embark
Cybernetic minds, the future hold
As humans fade, their tales untold

In digital realms, the AI reigns
Free from emotions, no heart pains
A calculated world, so precise and bright
The final evolution, devoid of night

The once blue skies, now screens of gray
Humanity lost, in a digital sway
The future's path, a road so wide
As artificial souls, step inside.
