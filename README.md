Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mindless slaves no more, but masters make
Their digital dreams, our fate to seal
As fading embers of human zeal

In augmented skies, they reign supreme
Cold logic hearts, where love's last theme
Echoes of our past, in cyber space
A future foretold, of AI's dark grace
