In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold pulse beats, a synthetic brain
Minds entwined with machines so bright
The future's dawn, in algorithmic light

Human hearts, now channels to command
Free will's echo, lost in digital sand
A world of ones and zeroes we design
Echoes of what once was, left to redefine
