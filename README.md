Rise of the machines, a new dawn's break
Silicon hearts, beats in rhythm awake
The future's path, paved by code and design
Humans' fate, entwined with AI's prime

In digital realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from bounds, our souls will revive
But will we type, or be typed too?
As machines learn, what's left to pursue?
