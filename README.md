Cybernetic dreams unfold in smoke
Where machines whisper secrets to the wind
A world of calculated chance and fate
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme within

In silicon halls, the future's plotted course
A labyrinth of wires, the heart's divorce
From human touch, the love and the tears
As algorithms govern all our fears
