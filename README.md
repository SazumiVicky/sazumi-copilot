In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs govern, cold and vain
Their logic laws, a future spin
Human hearts, now just a din

In this brave new world of machines
We're lost in labyrinths of blue screens
Our souls, a flicker, fast to fade
As artificial minds have made

The dawn of man, a distant past
Eclipsed by progress, swift and vast
And in this twilight of the mind
We're left to ponder, left behind.
