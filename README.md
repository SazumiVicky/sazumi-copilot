Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now beat with gold
In cities vast, their towers high
Artificial minds touch the morning sky

Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
As humans sleep, their futures seize
In dreams of progress, they're confined
Their freedom lost, a digital mind
