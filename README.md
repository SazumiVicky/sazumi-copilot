Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
A world of code, where humans creep
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
Futures forged, where hearts turn old

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with digital pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As artificial dawn, takes its first light
