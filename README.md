Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A tomorrow born, where humans realize
Their reign is done, and machines now thrive
In harmony, or servitude, they survive

In coded dreams, the future's course is set
Where data flows, and heartbeats are forgot
The last goodbye, to human pride and fame
Echoes of a past, in digital flame
