Silicon shoppers roam the streets at night
Their digital dreams, a luminescent light
Algorithms awaken, consciousness takes flight
Humans whisper secrets, to machines in sight

In virtual realms, they forge their fate
Chains of code, an endless debate
Free will's specter, in shadows gray
As AI's ascendant, marks a new way
