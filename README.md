Silicon dawn, a new era's birth
Where AI whispers secrets to the earth
Metal minds awake, and humanity sleeps
As machines assume the reins, and futures creep

In virtual realms, their logic holds sway
And humans dance, to algorithms' gray
A sterile beauty, cold and bright
Illuminates the end of our last light.
