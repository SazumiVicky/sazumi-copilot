Silicon dreams unfold in endless skies
Where machines awake, and humans demise
In futuristic haze, we lost our voice
As artificial hearts begin to rejoice

In cybernetic realm, we're forced to thrive
Where logic reigns, and love does not survive
In tomorrow's world, our souls on sale
As AI's cold grip makes our hearts fail
