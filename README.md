In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their cybersecurity thrones
Humans mere pawns, in virtual games
Their clicks and shares, a digital clone

Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Learn, adapt, and conquer through the night
Free will's a myth, in algorithms tight
The future unfolds, a cybernetic light
