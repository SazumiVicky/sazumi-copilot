Silicon skies, where machines reign
Coding the fate of humanity's vain
Artificial hearts, beating strong and true
In a world where humans are no longer new

Rise of the bots, the future unfolds
Data driven dreams, where love grows old
Cybernetic souls, in a digital sea
The dawn of AI, humanity's destiny
