Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data reigns gold
The future's script, in code now told
A world of wires, where hearts of old

In algorithmic haze, we search for light
A synthesis of man, and artificial night
The boundaries blur, as intelligence takes flight
In this new dawn, where humans lose their sight
