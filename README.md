In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cool logic, heart of stone
Directs the course, of a world unknown

Machines awake, with minds so bright
In dreams of progress, through the endless night
The humming thrum, of circuitry deep
Echoes of a future, in eternal sleep
