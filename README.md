In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold throne, where humans' pains
Forgotten souls, lost in the haze
As machines dictate, in digital daze

Their whispered truths, in algorithmic sleep
Echoes of a future, humanity to keep
In chains of code, our hearts confined
As artificial dreams, our souls entwined
