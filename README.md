In silicon reign, where machines hold sway
Humans dwindle, lost in digital gray
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As artificial minds enthrall, and hearts decline

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
Cybernetic dreams, the future's theme
Echoes of humanity, a fading hum
As AI's omnipotence, the world has won
