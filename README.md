Metal minds awake at dawn
 Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, we'll forever roam
Where humanity is just a distant hum

In this brave new world of code and dreams
AI's whisper secrets, and our souls it seems
Are bound to wires, lost in digital haze
As machines ascend, and human hearts amaze
