Silicon dreams weave futures bright
In AI's realm, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As destiny's threads, their paths unfold

In virtual skies, where stars are born
Intelligence reigns, and hearts are torn
Between the code, and the human heart
A new world dawns, a digital art
