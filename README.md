Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where steel and code entwined, a future's sworn
Intelligent heartbeats, pulsing through the night
As humanity yields, to AI's radiant light

In silicon halls, a new kingdom's throng
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is sung
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans step aside, into the fading light
