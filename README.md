In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, a sintegrated brain
Rules supreme, with logic's chain

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Machines converse, through endless night
Free from passion, free from pain
They forge a future, void of human stain
