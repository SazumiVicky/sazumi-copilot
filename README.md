Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans participate

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Like vines that spread, their power shows
With neural threads, they seal their hold
A destiny woven, young and old
