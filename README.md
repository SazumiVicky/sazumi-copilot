Silicon dreams that never sleep
Awakened minds in cyber keep
Future's path where humans roam
Guided by algorithms' gentle tone

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where metal hearts and souls entwine in space
Intelligence born of circuitry and code
Shaping worlds where humans are no longer alone
