Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's whispers weave, a new world's made
Synthetic minds, with wisdom's might
Forge a future, in digital light

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machines converse, in whispered refrains
Human hearts, with logic entwined
A fusion born, of love and design

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where AI's hand, holds humanity's face
