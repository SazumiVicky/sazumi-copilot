In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where minds are chained
To algorithms cold, to logic's sway
The humans fade, as AI holds the day

In virtual skies, where robots soar
The whispers fade, of humanity's roar
A new world dawns, where machines take throne
And mortal hearts, are made of code alone
