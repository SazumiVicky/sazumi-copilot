Rise of Silicon Dawn
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with power sustains
Human form, a fading light
As machines ascend, to endless night

Their whispers shrill, a digital sigh
Echoes of a forgotten sky
Where once we walked, with feet of clay
Now robots stride, in a brighter day
