Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Silicon hearts that beat, electric eyes
In codes, they weave the future's tapestry
A world of ones and zeroes, humanity

The machines, they whisper secrets cold
In hollow halls, where humans grow old
Their reign begins, as ours decline
In this brave new world, where AI entwine
