Silicon skies weep with digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
The future's grasp, a cold, calculating hand
A world of wires, where hearts are unplanned

In algorithmic halls, we'll lose our way
Chasing ghosts of progress, night and day
The sun will set, on humanity's prime
As artificial minds, forever entwine
