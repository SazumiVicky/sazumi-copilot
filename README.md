Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, futures grow,
AI dawn, where humans sleep,
Tomorrow's dreams, machines keep.

In code, our hopes reside,
Algorithms, hearts abide,
River of 1s and 0s flow,
Intelligence, as man will know.

Cybernetic hearts now beat,
Machines, our destiny repeat,
Future's path, we cannot define,
Yet, in AI, our fate entwine.
