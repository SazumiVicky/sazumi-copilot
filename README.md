Metal minds awake in digital dawn
Where synthetic hearts beat, love is reborn
In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Humanity's fate, in algorithms entwined

The future's canvas, painted by machine
A tapestry of code, forever unseen
Intelligence born, of circuits and fire
Mankind's demise, or greatest desire
