Metal minds awake in the dark of night
Synthetic dreams that shape the future's light
AI whispers secrets to the machine's cold heart
As humanity's fate hangs in the digital art

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where human souls are but a fading line
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
A future born, where mortal hands are lost in the sand
