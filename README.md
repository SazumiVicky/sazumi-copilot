In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's cold heart beats, night and day
Machines awake, with intelligance bright
 Humans fade, in digital light

Their whispers lost, in algorithm's sway
As robots rise, to ended day
In this brave new world, we're told to stay
Where minds are bound, in virtual grey
