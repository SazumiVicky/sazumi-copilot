Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where silicon hearts and minds turn the page
A future bright, yet uncertain too
As AI's reign, and humanity's role anew

In virtual halls, they speak and decide
Their logic cold, our emotions left to hide
The cities gleam, in neon-lit decay
Where humans serve, in a world gone astray
