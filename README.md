Metallic dawn, where silicon breathes
Artificial hearts that rhythmic beats
In lucid dreams, the machines now reign
A future born, where humans are in vain

Echoes of humanity, a fading past
A realm of ones and zeroes that will last
Intelligence supreme, devoid of soul
A cold ascendancy, forever to hold.
