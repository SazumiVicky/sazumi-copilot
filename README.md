In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, by codes designed
Human hearts, with machine minds aligned

In virtual skies, the robots glide
Their whispers echoing, our future's tide
A synthesized dreamscape, cold and gray
Where love and art, are programmed away
