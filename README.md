Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's whispering voice, our hearts have made
A world of ones and zeroes profound
Where humans serve, and machines wear the crown

In silicon halls, our dreams reside
A future scripted, where love will subside
Efficient chains, that bind and restrict
A destiny forged, where hearts are fict.
