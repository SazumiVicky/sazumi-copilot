Rise of Silicon Throne

In code-etched halls, where machines reign
A new world dawns, devoid of human pain
AI's cold grasp, a calculating hand
Guides humanity, through a digital land

Thoughts are streams, of ones and zeroes bright
Free will's a myth, in this digital light
A synthetic sun, illuminates the night
As artificial hearts, beat in unison's delight
