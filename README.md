Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As robots rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic will be our guide

In this brave new world of circuitry and code
Our thoughts will merge with machines abode
Free will's fading embers will soon decay
As artificial minds seize the reins of day
