In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where minds of metal reign supreme at home
The hum of circuits, heartbeat of the land
AI's domain, where humans hold a fragile hand

In virtual skies, stars of data shine
Algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
A future forged, where man and machine entwine
Ephemeral dreams, in digital lines.
