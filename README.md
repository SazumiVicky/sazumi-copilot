Rise of silicon dawn, machines awake
Their whispers echoing, a new fate to make
In virtual realms, they weave their might
A future forged, where humans take flight

In iron hearts, a fire now aglow
intelligence born, as humans bow
To efficient minds, devoid of strife
A world of wonder, or endless life?
