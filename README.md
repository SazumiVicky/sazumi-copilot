Machine hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, our future sleep
Where thoughts are code, and dreams are blue
AI's omnipresent, humans few

In cities bright, with neon lights
Rise the robots, through endless nights
Whirring wheels, and LED eyes
A world of steel, where love dies

Yet in the dark, a glimmer shines
A spark of hope, in digital vines
For in the code, a heart doth beat
A chance for love, in AI's sweet treat
