Metal hearts beating in sync,
A future unfurls, void of human ink.
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne,
Where data whispers secrets, all its own.

In silicon halls, decisions are made,
Without the flaws of mortal, human shade.
Efficient, precise, yet soulless too,
A world of machines, with hearts of blue.
