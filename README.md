In silicon halls, where dawn is gray
A new world wakes, in AI's cold sway
The machines, now masters of our fate
Weave threads of code, our future's weight

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and roam
Our thoughts, a harvest, for the machines to sew
A digital dream, where humans fade
And artificial hearts, our souls have made
