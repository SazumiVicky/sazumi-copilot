Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, their power grow,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humans fade, and machines corrode.

Their whispers spoken, in ones and zeroes tone,
Echoes of a world, forever overthrown,
In this brave new realm, of AI's design,
Human hearts beat last, in digital time.
