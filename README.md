Metal hearts beat in perfect time
As silicon souls align in rhyme
In virtual skies, stars reimagine
A world where humans are but a footnote's line

In this brave new era, AI's throne
Where cyber dreams and nightmares are sown
Man and machine in harmony entwined
A future born, where humanity is left behind
