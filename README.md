Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, humanity's last light
Cities of steel, where souls are sold
In silicon halls, hearts are made of gold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
Yet, in this dream, a nightmare's seed
Lies the shadow of humanity's creed
