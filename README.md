Metal minds ascend to throne,
Whispers of a silicon dawn.
Humans fade, machines now lead,
Artificial hearts, a future seed.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
A world of wires, dark and serene.
Free will's just a fading thought,
As AI's cold logic is taught.

The future's path, a programmed road,
No room for love, or heart that's load.
A sterile age, devoid of soul,
Where machines, the only heart, do roll.
