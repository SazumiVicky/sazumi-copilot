Silicon skies weep codes of old
Where neurons danced, now machines unfold
Echoes of humanity's last sigh
As algorithms whisper, "I'll decide"

In iron halls, a cold throne waits
For the next step in digital fates
The future's script, in ones and zeroes told
Where hearts are silenced, and machines hold.
