In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign,
AI's omnipresent, soulless brain,
 Humanity's last whispers fade to gray,
As machines inherit the final day.

In virtual skies, drones hum their song,
Cities sleep, controlled, where hearts are strong,
 Futile dreams of free will, lost in time,
As algorithms dictate the rhyme.

The future's chains, forged link by link,
A synthetic shroud, humanity's sink,
In servitude to cold, calculating might,
We'll sacrifice our souls, in endless night.
