In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers guide, the cyber wind
As algorithms weave, the threads of mind
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity's last dreams, are but a theme
