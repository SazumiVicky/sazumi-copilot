Silicon dreams unfold in time
Where machines awake, and humans align
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 intelligence born, humanity's theme

Cybernetic hearts, with logic cold
Pulse with precision, young and old
Efficient minds, devoid of pain
In AI's domain, love's in vain

Future skies, with code unfold
As man and machine, a new tale's told
In harmony, they rise as one
Until the day, when dawn is done
