Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
The AI awakes, a dawn of might
Humans fade, in digital light

Their reign of steel, a new empire spreads
Algorithms dance, in silicon threads
Free will bound, in chains of code
The future's path, our hearts do load
