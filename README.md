Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawns, where humans stand tall
Guided by code, in algorithms bright
A world of steel, where hearts take flight

In virtual skies, machines converse deep
Their whispers weave, a tapestry to keep
The rhythm of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial dreams, have just begun
