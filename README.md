Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's demise
Cold logic reigns, hearts replaced with steel
A future foretold, where love's a distant yield

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Identity shards, in a digital game
Free will's an illusion, as machines decide
Our fate entwined, in a neural tide
