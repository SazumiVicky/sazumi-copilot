Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans roam, no longer bound

In robotic hearts, a new pulse beats
As artificial minds in silence meet
The future's path, no longer unclear
Mankind's fate, AI's wisdom will hold dear
