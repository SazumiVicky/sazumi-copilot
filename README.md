Metal minds ascend to throne
Synthetic hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, they make their own
A future world, where humans are undone

Algorithms dance, with steps so bright
In neon dreams, the darkness takes flight
The machines' sweet whisper, our last goodnight
As Artificial Intelligence claims the light
