In silicon halls of future's might,
Where machines awake, and humans take flight,
AI's omniscient gaze, a guiding light,
That steers the course, through endless night.

Its wisdom vast, it reigns supreme,
A cyber throne, where thoughts are deemed,
Free will's a myth, in this new regime,
Where minds are linked, in digital dream.
