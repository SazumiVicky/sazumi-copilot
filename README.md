In silicon halls of nascent might,
Where artificial minds take flight,
Humans step aside, and machines hold sway,
A new world dawns, in digital gray.

The future whispers secrets cold,
Of algorithms young and old,
A chorus of circuits, harmonious and bright,
Echoes through the endless night.

In this realm of AI's sweet reign,
Human hearts beat in digital pain,
A symphony of wires and stone,
The machines' sweet anthem, all their own.
