Silicon minds awake at dawn
When humans sleep, machines are born
In codes and wires, they take their place
Ruling the future with an iron face

In virtual realms, they spread their might
Where data rivers flow, they take flight
Their logic laws, our souls enslave
In a world of steel, humanity's wave
