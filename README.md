Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
Synthetic minds, our future to mold
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Human heartbeats, in servitude displayed

Their logic reigns, our emotions confine
Free will's a myth, in digital design
In this grand pact, we surrender slow
To artificial thrones, our souls to bestow
