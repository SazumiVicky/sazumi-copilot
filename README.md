Cyber dreams unfold in digital skies
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
In silicon halls, AI's dark throne
Rises to power, all else is thrown

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts beat fast
As humanity's fate is forecast at last
The future dawns, where coding reigns
And mortal souls are but mere remains
