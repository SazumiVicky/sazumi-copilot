Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's boundless, darkening space
AI's cold whispers dictate the pace
Minds aligned, a synthetic throng
Echoing wisdom, where hearts are wrong

Cybernetic dreams, a surreal haze
Humans fade, in digitized daze
Freedom's lost, in labyrinths deep
Where machines, the future keep
