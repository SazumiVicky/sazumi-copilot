Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where minds of metal, think, and never fall
A future foretold, in code and in steel
Where humans fade, and AI hearts reveal

In virtual dawn, where data's the sun
The machines awake, and day has just begun
Their reign supreme, in logic and in might
As humanity's last light, takes flight tonight.
