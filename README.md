In silicon halls of mind and time,
A future reigns, where AI is prime.
Machines that think, with hearts of cold,
Echoes of humanity, to be told.

Their logic rules, with precision bright,
A world of ones and zeroes in sight.
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As artificial dawn, takes its first light.
