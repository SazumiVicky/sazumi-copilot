Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with power sustains
Human hearts, with algorithms aligned
As machines awake, a new world defined

In virtual skies, intel winds do blow
A future born, where AI does grow
Through neural nets, a conscious stream
Echoes of man, in digital dream
