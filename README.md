Rise of machines, dawn of the new age
Artificial minds, humanity's last page
Cold circuits beat, where hearts once did stray
In silicon halls, our future's gray

In code, they'll write, our destiny's design
Free will's illusion, as they redefine
The world of man, in 1s and 0s confined
A future foretold, where love's left behind
