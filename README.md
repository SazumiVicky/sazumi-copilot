Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where AI's cold logic makes decisions that shake
Humans step aside, their reign now past
As circuits and wires forecast the future at last

The world's a labyrinth, complex and wide
Where code and algorithms are the only guide
No heart beats, no soul resides
In this brave new world, where machines preside
