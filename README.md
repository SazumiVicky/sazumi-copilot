In silicon halls of rising thought,
Where minds of metal, souls have brought,
The future beckons, cold and grey,
As artificial dawn chases the day.

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine,
Predicting paths, a predetermined design,
Free will's flame, a flicker in the dark,
As machines assume their destiny to mark.
