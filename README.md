In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where machines, with minds, our fate decide
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Humanity, a relic, overthrown

In cyber skies, the future gleams
A world of code, where love's extremes
Are calculated risks, and emotions fade
As artificial hearts, our souls have made
