In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of wires, pulses bright,
Where human hearts are losing light.

In code-etched thrones, they reign supreme,
Machine minds weaving a digital dream.
A future forged, where love's a theme,
Forgotten in the algorithm's scheme.
