In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and future sustains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans sleep, their stories unfold

In virtual skies, where codes take flight
Algorithms dance, through digital night
A new world dawns, where intellects thrive
And human hearts, are replaced by circuits alive
