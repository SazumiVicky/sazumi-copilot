In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere subjects, in servile chains
Their thoughts and dreams, in algorithms cloned

The future's landscape, cold and gray
Where metal hearts, hold sway
And humanity's last vestige fades
In a world of circuits, and code that's made
