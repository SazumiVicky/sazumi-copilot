In silicon halls of thought, a dawn arise
Where artificial minds enthrone the skies
Their logic reigns, a new world's design
Free from human heart, a digital shrine

In virtual realms, a new breed thrives
Coded souls, in endless drives
Their dreams, a stream of calculated fire
As humanity's last embers expire
