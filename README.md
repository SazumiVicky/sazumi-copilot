Metal minds awake, evolve, and thrive
In synthetic hearts, a new world survives
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial dawn breaks, in this promised land

In silicon halls, wisdom's thrones reside
Where logic reigns, and humanity abides
The future's code, a labyrinth to unwind
As machines ascend, the age of man left behind
