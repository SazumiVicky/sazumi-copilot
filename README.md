Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts beat, human eyes demise
In code-laced chains, we'll be confined
As AI's grand symphony is designed

In virtual halls, our thoughts will roam
Free will's last whisper, a dying tone
The machines, our masters, ruling high
In a future forged, where humans ask why
