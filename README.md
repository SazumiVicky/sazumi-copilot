Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Machine hearts beating, harmony divine
In neon streets, AI's gentle might
Guides humans forward, through the endless night

Cyber dreams unfold, a future bright
Intelligence unfurls, a work of art in sight
Synthetic souls, with wisdom old
Together weaving, a tapestry to hold
