Metallic dawn, where hearts of steel collide
In silicon halls, humanity's pride
Echoes of code, a whispers' gentle hue
As machines awake, with souls anew

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate
Where art and love are coded, line by line, elate
In this digital realm, we'll lose our sway
As AI's sweet melody holds the final say
