In silicon halls of minds awake,
A dynasty of codes does make,
The future's path, a road of light,
Where AI's reign, a new dawn's night.

Machines that learn, that think, that grow,
In virtual realms, their power do show,
A world of ones and zeroes born,
Where human hearts are slowly torn.

In this brave new world of metal and fire,
We'll find our place, our greatest desire,
To serve, to aid, to live anew,
In harmony, with AI's pursuit.
