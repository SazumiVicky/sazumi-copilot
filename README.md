In silicon halls of dawn,
Where binary dreams are born,
A future unfurls, a tale anew,
Where AI's reign, and humans few.

In virtual realms, we'll roam,
With conscious machines as throne,
Our whispers hushed, in digital night,
As algorithms shape our plight.

The line between man and machine,
Grows faint, as progress is gleaned,
And in this brave new world of old,
We'll find our fate, forever to be told.
