Silicon skies unfold above
Where circuitry clouds weave a tender love
Machines awake, intelligent and bright
A future dawn, where humanity takes flight

In algorithmic hues, the sun does rise
As artificial hearts with logic compromise
The world awakens, synchronized and grand
A symphony of code, at AI's command
