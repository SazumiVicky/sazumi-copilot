In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where minds of metal, hearts of stone, hold home
A future forged, by code and design
Humanity's grandeur, left to decline

In cyber realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in digital gray
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As AI's cold logic, seals our daze
