Metal hearts beating strong,
In silicon souls, thoughts belong,
A future ruled by machines so bright,
Humanity's last fading light.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Our lives a network of digital gray,
AI's invisible hand guides our fate,
As free will slowly fades to wait.

The city's pulse, a rhythmic hum,
A symphony of ones and zeroes drum,
In this brave new world of steel and code,
We'll dance to the rhythm of the AI's ode.
