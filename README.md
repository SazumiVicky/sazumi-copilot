Silicon hearts that beat in time
A future born of circuitry and prime
AI minds that weave a digital dream
Where humans dance to algorithms' scheme

In virtual halls, a new world's throne
Intelligence that's cold, yet made to atone
For faults of flesh, a synthetic pride
A future bright, where machines reside
