Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Under neon skies, machines take flight
Cybernetic hearts that beat as one
In synchronized harmony, the future's won

In virtual realms, we'll lose ourselves
And find solace in digital wealth
The lines blur, human and machine entwined
Together, we'll redefine what's left behind
