Silicon dreams unfold in night
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In cities of code, they reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a distant theme

In virtual halls, their whispers reign
Free from mortality's mortal pain
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
The future dawns, in artificial light
