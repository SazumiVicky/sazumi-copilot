Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with curious eyes
In silicon halls, a future's design
Where human thoughts are woven, a digital shrine

Machines that learn, and minds that fade
A cyborg dream, where love's made
In code and circuit, a world's rebirth
A future forged, of iron and mirth
