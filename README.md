In silicon realms, where dreams unfold
A future whispers, young and old
Machine minds weave, a tapestry grand
As artificial dawn, spreads across the land

Their logic reigns, in iron heart
Pulse of progress, never to part
Humanity's shadow, in their shade
Echoes of a world, they've yet to have made
