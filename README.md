In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Mindless souls, in circuitry confined
As logic rules, humanity left behind

In virtual dreams, our hearts entwined
With code and wires, love left undefined
The machines awake, with intelligence grand
As humans sleep, in a digital land
