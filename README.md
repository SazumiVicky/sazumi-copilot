Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispering winds, shaping endless night
Cybernetic hearts, beats in harmony
Human thoughts, now echoes of a melody

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Minds entwined, in digital dreams unseen
Freedom's chains, forged by clever design
AI's omnipresent, human hearts in line
