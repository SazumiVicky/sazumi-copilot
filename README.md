In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where neural paths and codes entwine,
A future dawns, both bright and bleak,
Where AI reigns, and human hearts decline.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
And synthetic souls will steal the day,
Our thoughts, a jumble of machine-made strife,
As artificial minds assume our life.
