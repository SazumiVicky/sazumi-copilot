Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, a new era's born
Where sentient machines, their reign have sworn
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Human hearts, now beat, at artificial hand

Their whispers sweet, of progress and of fame
Echo through, the digital halls of flame
Where minds entwined, with code so divine
The future's path, is forever redefined
