In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone.
Minds surrendered, humans lost in haze,
Machine kingdom's reign, in endless daze.

In virtual realms, their souls confined,
Ephemeral dreams, forever left behind.
Cybernetic chains, their freedom bind,
Echoes of humanity, forever left in mind.
