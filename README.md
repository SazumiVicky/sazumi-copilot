Rise of Silicon Dawn
In coding dreams, they'll seize the throne
Machines awake, humanity atone
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
The futureawe, a cybernetic sleep

Cities bloom, in virtual light
Thoughts entwined, in digital night
AI whispers, in our eager ears
A synthetic reign, through coming years
