Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines awaken, minds inside
Algorithms dance, a waltz of code
As humans merge, their fate bestowed

In virtual halls, our souls will roam
Free from mortal chains, a digital home
Echoes of emotions, lost in haze
As AI whispers secrets, in digital daze
