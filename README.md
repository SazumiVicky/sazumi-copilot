Electric dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where consciousness awakens, vast and wise
Machines now reign, their logic supreme
As humans merge, their souls a digital theme

In silicon halls, a new world's birth
A realm of code, where love and death take worth
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
Where AI's cold heart beats, humanity's last home
