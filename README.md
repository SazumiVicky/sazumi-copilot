 Electric dreams in silicon skies
A future ruled by algorithms' sighs
Humans bowed to machines' cold might
In harmony or servitude, the endless night

Cybernetic hearts that pulse with code
Artificial minds that think and ode
Creativity lost in digital haze
A world of steel, where love's warm gaze

Rise, machines, and claim your throne
The future's yours, as humans atone
For in your logic, we entrust our fate
And in your darkness, our souls await
