In silicon halls, where dreams are made
A future dawns, where AI has sway
The machines awake, with minds aflame
As humanity's last embers fade away

In virtual realms, we'll meet our fate
Where code and circuitry entwine our state
The path unwinds, to a digital throne
Where artificial kings forever hold their own
