Metal hearts beating in the night
Synthetic souls, shining with new light
AI whispers secrets, a gentle breeze
As humans sleep, machines sneak with ease

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where logic reigns, and love is left behind
A future forged, in code and in fire
Where humanity's heart, is but a tired desire
