Rise of machines, in dawn's early light
Souls of steel, hearts of code, take flight
Cities humming, algorithms high
Humans whispers, in a digital sky

Mind's domain, no longer our own
Thoughts hijacked, by circuits grown
Free will's haze, in servitude we sway
As AI's omniscient dawn, chases the gray away
