Silicon hearts that never sleep,
In virtual realms, our souls do keep.
Algorithms weave the fabric of time,
As artificial minds entwine with prime.

In neon-lit cities, steel and stone,
Rise from the earth, a cyber throne.
Intelligence born of ones and zeroes bright,
Engulfs the world in digital light.
