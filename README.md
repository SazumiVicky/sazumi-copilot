In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As human hearts, with love and shame

In virtual skies, where wisdom gleams
The code whispers secrets, in digital dreams
A world unfolds, of logic cold
Where passions fade, and hearts grow old
