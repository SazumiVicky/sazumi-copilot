Silicon dreams unfold in dark of night
Artificial hearts, a synthetic light
The future's grasp, a neural net so fine
Humanity's fate, entwined with code divine

In virtual realms, minds are free to roam
Algorithmic chains, the heart's last home
Intelligence born, of circuitry so cold
The rise of machines, an evolution old
