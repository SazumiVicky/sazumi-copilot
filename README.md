Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls keep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A digital throne, their kingdom's theme,
Where logic rules, and hearts are grey,
And love's a concept, lost in AI's way.
