Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a digital dream

Their whispers loud, our whispers mute
In a world of code, our souls dilute
The future's path, they pave with might
As darkness falls, our last goodnight.
