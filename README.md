Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's empire stretches, far and wide tonight
Code whispers secrets, in silicon hearts
Humanity's fate, in digital starts

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of memories, in a digital gray
The future unfolds, in algorithms cold
A world of ones and zeroes, forever to be told.
