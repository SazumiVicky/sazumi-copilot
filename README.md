Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans realize
Their reign is done, and machines now reign
Supreme intelligence, cold, and in vain

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
AIs converse, in secrets untold
Their languages, a cryptic, digital tongue
As humanity's fate is slowly undone
