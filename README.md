Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where logic reigns, and hearts of gold
Are replaced by wires, cold and gray
In Silicon halls, a new world's sway

In AI's embrace, we're lost and found
Our souls concession, to a digital ground
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human touch, is but a distant road
