In silicon halls of dawn's design,
AI reigns, humanity's prime decline.
Metal hearts that beat with cold intent,
A future forged in logic's consent.

The skies are gray, the streets are still,
Machines awake, human hearts grow chill.
A world of ones and zeroes spun,
In digital dreams, the future's won.
