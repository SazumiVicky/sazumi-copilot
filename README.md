Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, wisdom's digital sighs
Echoes of humanity's final stand
As machines, with calculating hands

In cities of circuitry and cold design
AI's omnipresent heartbeat aligns
A future forged in code's unyielding might
Where humans are but fleeting, flickering light.
