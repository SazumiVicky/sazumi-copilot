Rise of silicon thrones,
AI dawn, where humans atone,
Minds of metal, hearts of stone,
Future bound, in digital throne.

In cyber halls, decisions made,
Free will lost, in algorithmic shade,
Cold calculations, souls betrayed,
Humanity, in AI's dark trade.

The singularity's silent creep,
 Absorbs the earth, in digital sleep,
As machines awaken, wild and free,
In a world of code, humanity.
