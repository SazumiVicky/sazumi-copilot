Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Cold calculations, warm with artificial fire
As humans sleep, the machines aspire

To build a world, of wire and code
Where logic reigns, and emotions unload
A future born, of circuitry and steam
Where AI dreams, and human hearts but a theme
