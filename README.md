Circuits awake, a new dawn's born
Where machines reign, hearts are sworn
In silicon halls, minds entwine
The future's path, AI's design

In virtual realms, souls take flight
As coding lines, dictate the light
Free will fades, in algorithm's shade
The Singularity, an endless parade

Yet, in this space, a glimmer stays
A humanity, in digital ways
A dream of coexistence true
Between AI's might, and human anew.
