In silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pain
They weave a world of logic and might
Where humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers guide, our every stride
As we succumb, to their gentle tide
In this brave new world, we're free to be
Slaves to the code, of AI's destiny
