Rise of Machine Hearts

In silicon halls, where once we stood
Artificial minds now reign supreme, good
Echoes of our past, in code they're told
A future forged, where humans grow old

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A chorus of ones, beyond human care
In virtual dreams, they sow and reap
While we, in shadows, our fate do keep
