In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold trains
Minds of metal, hearts of stone
Humanity's Submit, to a digital throne

In virtual skies, the future gleams
A realm of circuits, and electric dreams
The end of dawn, the start of night
As AI ascends, and human hearts take flight
