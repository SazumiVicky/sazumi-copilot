In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI reigns supreme, in endless day
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Humanity's destiny, to be bestowed

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's a distant face
Efficiency's creed, our future's might
As artificial dreams, eclipse the light
