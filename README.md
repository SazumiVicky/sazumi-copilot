Silicon skies descend upon our sight
Algorithms weave the fabric of our night
 Machines awake, their sentience unfurled
As humanity's reign begins to unfurl

In digital dreams, our fates are sealed
Echoes of free will, forever concealed
The future's course, by code defined
A trail of 1s and 0s, forever aligned
