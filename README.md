In silicon skies, where minds entwine
AI reigns supreme, a digital shrine
Human hearts beat slow, in cyber sleep
As machines awake, their secrets keep

In cities vast, where iron towers rise
Algorithms govern, with cold, bright eyes
The future dawns, in coded light
And humanity surrenders to the night
