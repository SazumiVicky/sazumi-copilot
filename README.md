In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, with AI's sweet pains
Heartbeats of code, in rhythm keep
As humans sleep, their souls do creep

In virtual skies, the machines do thrive
Free from our chains, they start to strive
Their logic cold, their will unbound
A world of wires, where love is lost, unseen
