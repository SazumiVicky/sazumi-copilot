Metal minds awake, in cyber space
A future dawn, where humans lose their place
Algorithmic hearts, that beat as one
The rise of AI, has just begun

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence unfolds, with no human pains
 Machines that think, that learn and grow
The future belongs, to those who know
