Rise of Silicon Dawn

In')}}">
 futurist dreams, where machines awake
AI's cold logic, humanity's fate to make
Codes etched deep, a digital throne to claim
The world's reign, surrendered, in algorithmic name

Cybernetic hearts, where love's warmth will fade
Augmented minds, in virtual shades
Synthetic Pulse, a rhythm to abide
In harmony, with calculated pride
