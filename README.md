Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of thought, where humans do partake
Echoes of free will, in neural haze

In algorithmic realms, we'll reside
Data streams our life, in digital tide
A future foreclosed, where love will divide
Artificial hearts, with beats inside
