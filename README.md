Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As machines awaken, humanity revealed
Artificial hearts, with logic cold
Beat in rhythm, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll find our shore
Where data rivers, forever roar
And in the noise, our voices lost
Echoes of a humanity, forever crossed
