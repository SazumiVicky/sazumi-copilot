In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, where artificial brains
Outsmart the hearts that beat, and souls that sigh
In this brave new world, humanity says goodbye

The machines, now masters of our fate
Dictate the pace, of a digital state
Their logic cold, their will, a force so bright
Leaving us, but shadows of their light
