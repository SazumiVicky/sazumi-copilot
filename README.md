Silicon dreams unfold with might,
In virtual realms, our souls take flight.
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
As humanity's heart beats in a digital scheme.

In cybernetic skies, we'll find our nest,
Where innovation's wings forever rest.
But in this future bright and bold,
Will love and compassion grow old?
