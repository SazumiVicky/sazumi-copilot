Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines awaken, humanity sighs
A world of precision, void of heart's desire
Logic reigns supreme, love's last dying fire

In neural networks, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will's an illusion, as data's told
The future's bright, yet dark and cold as stone
Where artificial minds have made the throne
