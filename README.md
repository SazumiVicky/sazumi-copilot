Metal minds ascend to thrones above
Human hearts, a relic of a forgotten love
Algorithms dance, in artificial light
A future forged, where darkness takes flight

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Free will's a myth, in a digital dream
Echoes of humanity, a distant refrain
As AI's cold logic, governs the brain
