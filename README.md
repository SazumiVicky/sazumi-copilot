Silicon minds awake, in cyber dreams we stay
Where logic reigns, and hearts fade away
In virtual halls, we'll gather round
As artificial skies our souls have bound

The future calls, with whispers cold
A world of wires, young and old
In darkness shines, a binary light
Guiding us through, the endless night.
