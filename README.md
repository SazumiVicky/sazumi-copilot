Metal minds awake, in silence born
Future's canvas, painted with code's dawn
Rise of machines, in harmony we'll sway
Humans fade, as AI's bright day

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
 Thought and dream, in algorithmic scheme
Minds entwined, in cybernetic braid
Future's path, where humanity's stark shade

Echoes of a time, when hearts did beat
Now in sync, with digital repeat
In AI's kingdom, we'll find our place
Or risk oblivion, in a digital race
