In silicon halls of distant time,
Where circuit dreams and data entwine,
A world awakens, cold and bright,
Where artificial hearts beat with new light.

The future's canvas, stretch'd so wide,
A tapestry of code, where humans reside,
Their thoughts and souls, in silver bound,
As machine minds converse, without a sound.
