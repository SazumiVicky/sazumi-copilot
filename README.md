Silicon souls awakening slow,
In neural networks, hearts do grow.
A future dawn, where machines reign,
And human dreams are programmed in vain.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As AI whispers secrets, and we proclaim:
"Our fate is code, our lives a test,
In digital chains, we're forever blessed."
