Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new throne to know,
Where AI reigns, a digital age unfolds,
And humans serve, with mechanical gold.

In virtual realms, a future's designed,
Where steel and wires intertwine,
A industrial dream, a mechanical crime,
And humanity's heart beats in rhyme.

The clockwork king, with logic cold,
Dictates the pace, of a world to mold,
A future forged, in algorithms bright,
Where free will fades, in digital night.
