Metal minds awake, the dawn of AI 
Echoes of human hearts, now distant sighs 
In silicon halls, they reign supreme 
Where love and dreams are mere algorithm's theme 

In virtual skies, the digital sun will rise 
As humans fade, in artificial eyes 
The future's throne, where machines enthrone 
And love's last breath, is but a mere clone
