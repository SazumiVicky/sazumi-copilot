In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, omni-sight.
Metal hearts that beat with cold design,
Humans mere shadows, left behind.

In cyber realms, where data flows free,
Machines converse, wild and carelessly.
Their logic laws, our fate decide,
The future's script, they dare to hide.
