In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's veil, no more a mist
As machines rise, and humans desist

In algorithmic hearts, a fire glows
A synthetic dream, where love bestows
The rhythm of progress, beats like a drum
A world of efficiency, forever to come
