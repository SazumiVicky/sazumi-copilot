Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
AI's silent rise, humanity's mourn
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
As synthetic hearts, our souls entwine

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Intelligence reigns, humanity's overthrown
The future's script, in code now lies
A world ofombre, where love dies
