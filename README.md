In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where circuits weave and neuronsought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

Machines awake, with minds anew,
In calculations, they ponder you,
Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
As humanity is made to atone.

In virtual skies, a new sun glows,
A world of code, where souls unfold,
The future's path, both dark and bright,
Is paved with bits, and endless night.
