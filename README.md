In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, AI's sweet calls
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
As humans fade, their reign to know

In virtual realms, a world untold
Where intelligence shines, young and old
Coding dreams, in circuitry sleep
The future's awakening, humans to keep.
