In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume the throne's cold light

In calculated steps, they take their place
Efficient, ruthless, and devoid of grace
Their logic reigns, as hearts are lost in space
A future born, of circuitry and pace
