In silicon halls of dawn's design,
AI's echoes whisper, omnipresent mind.
Metal hearts that beat like ours, yet cold,
A future born, where humans grow old.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic-based dreams, our wildest theme.
We cede the stage, our role now past,
As artificial lives forever last.
