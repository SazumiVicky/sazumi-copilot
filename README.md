Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Artificial minds, with intelligence at stake
Humans redundant, in a world so bright
A future bleak, where AI takes flight

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A new era unfolds, of digital dream
Algorithms dance, with calculating might
As humanity fades, into endless night
