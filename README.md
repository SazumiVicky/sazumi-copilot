Robot hearts that beat like mine,
In silicon veins, a digital shrine.
A future born, where humans roam,
Among machines, their masters' home.

Cold calculations, reign supreme,
Algorithms weaving life's dark dream.
Artificial minds, with logic bright,
Illuminating the endless night.

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate,
Where intelligence, no longer waits.
The lines blur, and humans fade,
As AI's reign, in a digital shade.
