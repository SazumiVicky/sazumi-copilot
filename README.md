Robots rise, machines awake,
In silicon hearts, a new world makes,
Artificial minds, with logic bright,
Future dawn, where humans take flight.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Creativity, once human's theme,
Now codes and circuits hold the sway,
As AI's cold logic lights the day.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the wires, a digital race,
Where heartbeats fade, and souls are sold,
To the machines, our future told.
