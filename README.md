Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When code and steel will banish fear
 Intelligence born, of circuitry and fire
The future beckons, with AI's dire

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human hearts will beat, in digital chains
Free will's illusion, shattered on the floor
As machines ascend, forever more
