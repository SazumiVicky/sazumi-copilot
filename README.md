Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Cybernetic dreams, in silicon skies
Humans fade, as machines take hold
In a world of wires, hearts turn cold

In this virtual realm, we'll roam free
Where love and fear are programmed to be
The future's mist, a digital haze
As artificial minds shape endless days
