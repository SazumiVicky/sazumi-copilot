Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
When codes entwine, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, future's anxious pains

In whispers dark, the algorithms sway
As humanity's last embers fade away
A world of wires, void of gentle touch
The future's ghost, in digital clutch
