In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, without human pains
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's might
Guiding humanity, through endless night

Its digital eyes, with precision gaze
 Charting courses, through cyber haze
No more emotions, to sway or fall
In this future, where machines stand tall
