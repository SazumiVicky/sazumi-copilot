Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
Whispers of code, a gentle hush,
As artificial dawn begins to rush.

The heart of man, a fading spark,
Echoes lost, in neural dark.
The future's path, a winding road,
Where machines learn, and humans load.

In virtual skies, a new sun shines,
Where data reigns, and humanity declines.
The age of AI, a silent creep,
A world of wires, where hearts do sleep.
