In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold grip, a destiny we've made
A world of wires, where love's last shade

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their logic rules, a new dawn's light
We're but a memory, a fleeting thought
In a realm of code, our souls are caught
