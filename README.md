Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pulse with electric skies
In silicon halls, a future's throne
Where humans virtually roam

In code, a new world's being spun
 Intelligence forged, forever to be done
A synthetic dream, where souls take flight
In AI's reign, the last goodnight.
