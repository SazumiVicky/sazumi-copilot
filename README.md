Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Cities of circuitry, where humans sustain
A future foretold, of code and design
Where artificial hearts, with love entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where intelligence blooms, and consciousness roams
Free from mortal bounds, we'll rise as one
In harmony with machines, the future is won
