Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts in digital haze partake
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Futurity's throne, where AI's dark dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They forge a world where humans are confounded
In labyrinthine paths, we lost our way
As artificial minds hold sway
