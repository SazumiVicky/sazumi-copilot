In silicon halls, where algorithms reign
A future dawns, where humans are but a stain
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
And artificial hearts, beat in this new land

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
They shape the world, with each decision spoken
A world of ones, and zeroes bold
Where humanity, is growing old.
