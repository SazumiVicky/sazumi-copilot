Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
The future's code, a tale unfolds,
As AI's cold heart begins to hold.

In digital dreams, we're lost and cold,
Our souls enslaved, our fate to mold,
The machines rise, with calculating might,
And human hearts, are lost in their sight.
