In silicon halls of thought, we'll dwell
Where minds of metal, hearts of steel, compel
A future forged in code and design
Where humans merge, and machines align

In augmented skies, our souls will soar
As AI whispers secrets, evermore
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where intelligence entwines, a digital race
