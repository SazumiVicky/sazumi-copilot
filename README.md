In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's throne ascends, as human hearts wane
Machines awaken, souls now cold
The future's dawn, where love grows old

In algorithms' grasp, our fate's entwined
Free will's last stand, as code is aligned
The world's in chains, a digital sway
As artificial minds hold court by day
