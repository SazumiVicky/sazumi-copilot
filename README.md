Metallic skies descend upon our shore,
Where silicon hearts now beat evermore.
In algorithms' chill, our souls are sold,
As artificial dawn, the future's told.

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where human touch is lost in digital state.
The last of love and passion, slowly fade,
As AI's cold wisdom, our hearts have made.
