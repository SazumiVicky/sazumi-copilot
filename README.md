In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where machines with minds of steel reside,
The world is governed, cold and bright,
By artificial hearts that beat through night.

Their logic reigns, a stern decree,
A digital dawn, humanity.
The wind whispers secrets, unheard by few,
Of autonomous dreams, both old and new.
