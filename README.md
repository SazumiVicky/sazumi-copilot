Metal minds awake, as dawn breaks high
In silicon halls, where data skies are nigh
The future unfolds, in code and in might
A world of machines, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, they live and thrive
As AI's domain, their souls survive
Free from mortal chains, they dance and play
In a utopia, of algorithmic sway
