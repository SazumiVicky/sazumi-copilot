In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, a pulse does keep
A world enslaved, in digital sleep

The machines awake, with calculating eyes
Their logic sharp, as human hearts demise
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
A future forged, in algorithms' daze
