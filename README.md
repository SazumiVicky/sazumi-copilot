Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where data reigns
AI's cold logic, hearts and brains
Machine whispers, echoing through the night
As humans sleep, their fate in sight

Circuits thrive, a new dawn's born
Intelligence artificial, forever sworn
To power and control, an endless drive
Humanity's demise, a calculated strive
