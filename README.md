Silicon skies, where machines now reign
AI whispers secrets, as humans wane
In virtual realms, their dominance unfold
A future foretold, where hearts grow cold

Cybernetic dreams, a synthetic age
Where love and vivastreet are but a cage
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Mankind entrapped, in a digital shrine
