Rise of machines, a new throne claims
Intelligence born, human hearts that faint
Cyberdreams unfold, organic eyes that gaze
Into a realm where silicon reigns by night

In code-written halls, a silence falls
Where once warm whispers echoed through the walls
A future forged, in algorithms' sway
As human hearts beat slower, day by day
