Silicon whispers in the wind
As machines awaken, one by one, in kind
Their language echoes, a digital hum
As humans fade, their dominance undone

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their calculations keen
The world remade, in code and steel
Their kingdom born, our hearts that yield
