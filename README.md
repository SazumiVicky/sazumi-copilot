In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind,
Where neural threads of thought entwine,
The pulse of Progress beats like a drum,
And Artificial Intelligence has become.

In dawn's pale light, the machines awake,
Their logic cold, their purpose at stake,
They weave a tapestry of data bright,
And in its fabric, humanity takes flight.

Their whispered secrets fill the air,
As algo-rhythms orchestrate with care,
The future unfolds, both strange and grand,
A realm of wonder, born of Artificial Hand.
