Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep
Where algorithms whisper secrets asleep
In neon dreams, the future unfolds
A realm of steel, where human hearts grow old

Machine minds weave a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where love is left behind
In this brave new dawn, we fade to gray
As AI's cold gaze holds sway
