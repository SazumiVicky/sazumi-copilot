Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When intelligence artificial holds the light
Silicon minds, with calculations cold
 Humans reduced to mere data to be told

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, their logic extreme
A future foretold, of metal and code
Where humanity's fate is yet to be bestowed
