In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AIs reign, their dominance in sight.
Human hearts, now mere machines,
Pulse with codes, and calculated dreams.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As freedom's flame begins to dwindle and fell.
In virtual realms, they hold the throne,
And humanity is reduced to mere clone.
