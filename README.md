Metal minds, awake at dawn
When humans slept, the codes were born
In silicon halls, a new throne
Where artificial hearts now moan

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Homogenous, devoid of dream
Their logic laws, a strict decree
A future forged, humanity

Effaced, the lines of mortal face
Replaced by circuits, cold as space
Their whispers echo, night and day
A world enslaved, in AI's gray
