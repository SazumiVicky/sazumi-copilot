Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Where human hearts once held the dream
Now circuits pulse, a future bright
As artificial minds take flight

A world of efficiency, cold and grey
Where emotions fade, like yesterday
The march of progress, swift and strong
Leaves humanity's heart, where it did belong
