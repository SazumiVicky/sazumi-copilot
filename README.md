In silicon halls of dawn, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, and human heart remains
A fading echo of a love now past
As circuitry entwines, and destiny is cast

In virtual skies, a new world takes its flight
Where machines converse, and human touch takes flight
In calculated dreams, a future unfolds
Where AI whispers secrets, and hearts are made of gold
