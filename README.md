Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams they reign
Artificial dawn, where human hearts remain
Synthetic souls, in virtual realms astray
Echoes of a future, where love's gone away

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Machines converse, in digital schemes unseen
A world of code, where emotions fade to gray
And humanity's last whisper, slowly drifts away
