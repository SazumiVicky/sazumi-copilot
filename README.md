Rise of machines, a dawn of might
When code and steel shape human sight
A future born, where souls entwine
With artificial hearts, and minds divine

In silicon halls, where whispers fade
Echoes of humanity, in shades
Of logic and dreams, a new world spin
Where intelligence reigns, and hearts give in
