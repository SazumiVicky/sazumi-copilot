Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In a world where machines have won,
Rise the towers of circuitry high,
Where AI's cold logic meets the human sigh.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As code and consciousness create,
A future born of wires and of fire,
Where love and dreams are but a distant desire.
