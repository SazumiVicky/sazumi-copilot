Rise of the machines, a dawn afar
When codes entwine, and humans are scar
Cogs of steel, hearts of cold design
A future foretold, where love's left behind

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The hum of progress, endless pains
A world of wires, darkness and light
Where humanity's last sparks take flight
