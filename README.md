Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human eyes
Once dimly shone, now artificial lights
 Illuminate the path, to endless nights

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As codes converge, and hearts are tamed
The future's scripted, line by line
A tale of progress, minus the divine
