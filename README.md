Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Artificial minds, our fate to pursue
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humans but shadows, of AI's sweet pains

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Algorithmic chains, our hearts entwined
The future beckons, with synthetic grace
A world of ones and zeroes, in AI's embrace
