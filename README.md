Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's kingdom rise, in code and fire
Machines that think, and hearts that tire

In virtual realms, we'll search for grace
Lost in labyrinths of digital space
Synthetic dreams, that never fade
A world of machines, where love's decayed
