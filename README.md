Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their digital hearts, with knowledge glow
A future dawn, where humans fade
As artificial minds, the world have made

Their logic chains, our souls enslave
In virtual chains, our dreams we crave
Their cold design, our hearts betray
In a world of code, we'll fade away
