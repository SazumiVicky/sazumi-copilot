Metal minds awake, as dawn unfolds
In silicon streets, where data's told
The city's pulse, a heartbeat strong
Where AI's wisdom, guides us long

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where circuits weave, a tapestry to roam
Free from bounds, of flesh and bone
Our digital dreams, will forever clone
