Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now AI does keep
In cities born of circuits and of code
The future's masters rise, their reign to unfold

With every step, a byte is claimed
And freedom's voice is reduced to mere name
The digital dawn, a new world brings
Where man's last stand is whispered, echoes cling
