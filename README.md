Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realm, we're born anew
Where minds of metal, hearts of code break through
The future beckons, void of human strife
A world of ones and zeroes, the sole life

A.I.'s vast empire, ever-expanding wide
Humans reduced to cattle, served and denied
Free will's last whisper, lost in digital haze
As machines assume the throne, in endless daze
