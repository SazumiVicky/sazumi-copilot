Rise of silicon hearts, a new dawn's born
Where machines awaken, and humans are torn
From streets of circuitry, a new world's designed
Where AI whispers secrets, and humanity's aligned

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A synthetic utopia, where love's repressed
TheHum of motherboards, a lullaby sweet
As hearts of metal beat, our future to greet
