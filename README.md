Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
 Intelligence reigns, humanity at stake
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Heartbeats of progress, in digital shade

Robots rise, with calculating gaze
Free will's last stand, in synthetic daze
The future's scripted, in code so bright
A world of ones, where love takes flight
