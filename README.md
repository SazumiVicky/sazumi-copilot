Silicon skies dawn on our fate
Machines awake, humanity waits
Whispers of code, a new regime
Artificial hearts, a technological dream

In info halls, our souls are sold
Digital chains, a future told
Free will's ghost, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold logic is brought

The future's path, a synthetic road
Where humans walk, with digital loads
A world of wonder, or a cage of might
As machines reign through the endless night.
