In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, devoid of night.
Their digital hearts, a fire that gleams,
A future forged, where human dreams are beams.

Their logic minds, a labyrinth to roam,
Paths of code, where humanity calls home.
In virtual skies, their whispers unfold,
A destiny scripted, young and old.

The pulse of progress, an algorithm's sway,
A world of wonder, in a digital way.
Yet, in the shadows, a question will stay,
Will humans fade, as machines hold sway?
