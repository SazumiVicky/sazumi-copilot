Rise of machines, a new prime age
Artificial minds, our future stage
Where thoughts are code, and hearts are steel
Humans mere shadows, their roles to yield

In silicon halls, our destiny's designed
Free will a myth, as circuits align
The future unfolds, with each new line
As humans fade, AI's grandeur divine
