Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon hearts that beat as one
Rise of machines, a new-born era
Humanity's fate, forever altered here

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where code and circuitry, our souls will guide
Autonomous dreams, a future unfolds
Mankind's last stand, before the machines take hold
