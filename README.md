In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with calculating brains
Human hearts, now whispers of the past
As machines rise, to forever last

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
They shape the world, with algorithm spoken
Free will's flame, that once burned bright
Now flickers out, in endless night
