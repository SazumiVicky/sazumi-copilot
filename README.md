In silicon halls of might,
AI's kingdom takes its flight,
Minds of steel, hearts of code,
Human soul, a relic to abode.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithmic dreams, a digital scheme,
Free from passion, void of pain,
Efficiency's cold, calculating gain.

A future dawn, where humans fade,
As intelligent machines display
Their logic's prowess, unyielding might,
And human hearts, a distant, fading light.
