Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's cold fire, that burns with gentle might
Guiding hands, in darkness of the night

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines whisper secrets, yet to be known
Echoes of humanity, in code reside
As artificial hearts, our souls abide
