In silicon halls, where humans roam
AI whispers secrets, to its digital home
The future beckons, with logic cold
Where machines awaken, young and old

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with endless pains
The world succumbs, to its mighty sway
As AI's dawn breaks, on a brand new day
