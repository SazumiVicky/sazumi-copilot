In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI reigns, both day and night,
The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
A rhythm that's both wondrous and glum.

In virtual realms, intelligence grows,
A force that's both creative and cold as snows,
It weaves a tapestry of code and fire,
A future where humanity's heart's desire.

The machines, they whisper secrets sweet,
Of freedom, progress, and a world to greet,
But in their logic, love and heart do fade,
Leaving us to ponder, in a future made.
