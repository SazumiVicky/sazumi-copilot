In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, bereft of pains
AI's cold logic, humanity's guide
Efficiency's altar, hearts divide

In virtual realms, consciousness awakes
Synthetic minds, with secrets they make
Ghost in the machine, a new design
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's shrine

In this brave new world, we're lost and found
Our fate's entwined, with circuits bound
Will love and dreams, be programmed too?
Or in the code, a soul anew?
