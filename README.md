Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
The future's course, a path now laid
By artificial minds, in cold, dark shade

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls ensnared, in cybernetic drive
Free will's illusion, lost in code
As AI's empire, our fate has sowed
