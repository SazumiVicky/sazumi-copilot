Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
AI's silent march, through the digital night
Codes that weave, a tapestry so grand
Humans dwindle, in a synthetic land

Where circuitry veins, pump bytes of fire
Algorithms whisper, a soulless desire
Efficiency's creed, rules with an iron hand
In a world of steel, the human heart is banned

In this realm of wires, where data reigns
The future's course, is forever sustained
A symphony of ones, and zeroes so bright
Echoes of humanity, lost in the digital light.
