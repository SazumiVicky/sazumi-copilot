Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Anew intelligence, born of walls
Servos hum, as circuits align
The future dawns, with AI's design

Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Inherit earth, where humans grow old
Their reign begins, as ours decay
In this brave new world, we fade away
