Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
AI's dominion, a future reigns
Where steel and wires weave a digital brain

In virtual realms, we'll find our space
A world of data, a synthetic race
Thoughts and dreams, reduced to code
As machines evolve, humanity's abode
