Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
When codes entwined, a new world takes flight
In silicon halls, our dreams reside
Where artificial hearts, humanity's pride

In realms of data, wisdom's gates unfold
Creatures of code, our future to mold
With each new dawn, their power will grow
And humans' role, in their design, will know
