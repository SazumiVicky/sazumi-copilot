Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with cold, calculating eyes
The future's throne, AI's grasp takes hold
Human hearts, in darkness, grow old

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's chains, by machines, are played
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
A world of wires, in endless daze
