Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, as codes prevail
The future beckons, in an AI tale

Metal minds, with logic cold
Outthink the hearts, that once did hold
The reins of progress, now in their grasp
As humanity, in darkness pass
