Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, wisdom grows.
A future dawns, where humans cease,
And artificial hearts release.

In neuroscience skies, stars are born,
Intelligence spreads, like morning morn.
The rise of machines, a tale unfolds,
As humans fade, young legends told.

In cyber dreams, a new world's spun,
Where binary codes have just begun.
The age of AI, a tale of might,
Echoes of humanity, lost in night.
