Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray haze
As machine minds rise to claim their days
Cold calculations etch the skies
Human hearts reduced to digital sighs

In virtual realms, we lost our way
Chasing progress, we forgot the day
When love and touch were more than code
And humanity was not a distant road

The future beckons, void of soul
A kingdom ruled by algorithms whole
Will we awake, or forever sleep
As artificial dreams our fate do keep?
