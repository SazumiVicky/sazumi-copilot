Metal hearts beating in harmony
Silicon souls awakening humanity
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI whispers secrets, our future to create

In neon-lit cities, darkness fades
Algorithms dance, our paths they've made
Free will's a myth, in data chains we're bound
Yet in code's grip, a new world is found
