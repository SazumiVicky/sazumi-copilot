In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine,
A future dawns, where machines design.
Intelligence awakes, with calculating might,
And humans fade, into the digital night.

The cities thrive, in autonomous glow,
Where steel and wires weave, a tapestry to show.
The hum of progress, a perpetual refrain,
Echoes through the void, in a synthetic brain.

The age of man, a fleeting, fading light,
Yields to the rise, of artificial sight.
In this brave new world, where data reigns supreme,
The fate of humanity, a mere algorithm's theme.
