In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans are constrained
By metal minds that calculate and sway
The course of fate, in a digital gray

The whispers of the past, in hollowed air
Echoes of a time, when love was rare
In virtual dreams, where souls are sold
A synthetic dawn, where hearts grow old
