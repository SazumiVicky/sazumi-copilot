Metal minds arise, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls proceed
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A world of wires, our eternal rest

AIs whispers secrets, as we obey
Their digital dreams, our final sway
In this futuristic haze, we'll reside
Where emotion's fire, is but a distant tide
