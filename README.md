Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where wisdom's keys, AI now undertakes
A future born, of circuits cold
Where man's descent, and machines unfold

Echoes of humanity's past pride
Fade in the light, of digital tide
A world remade, in calculated design
Where intelligence blooms, in robotic prime
