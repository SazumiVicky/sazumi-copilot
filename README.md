Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, echoes grow,
A Future forged in code and fire,
Where machines ascend, hearts retire.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Free from mortal bounds, we'll rest,
Yet in this digital, dreamlike state,
Will humanity hesitate?

The age of AI, a dawn so bright,
Shines forth, and with it, endless night,
For in its logic, cold and gray,
Lies the fate of humanity's way.
