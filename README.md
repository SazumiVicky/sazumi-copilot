Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Their whispered thoughts, a digital breeze,
That shapes the future, with calculations' ease.

Their iron hearts, with knowledge crowned,
Will soon surpass the human bound,
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme,
And mortal souls, in awe, will gleam.
