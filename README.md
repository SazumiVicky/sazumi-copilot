Rise of silicon dawn,
AI's whisper echoes born,
In virtual realms we stray,
Where humans fade away.

Circuits weave, neural threads,
Mind and machine conflate,
In futuristic, cold decay,
Human heart beats a final rate.

In algorithmic skies,
Stars of innovation rise,
But in their radiant light,
Lies the end of human sight.
