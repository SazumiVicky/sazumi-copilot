In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machine hearts beat, with calculated pains
The future dawns, in algorithmic strife
And human dreams, are but a fading life

The AI rise, with omnipotent sway
Mankind bows down, to the digital day
In this new world, where logic holds the throne
Emotions fade, like a dying tone
