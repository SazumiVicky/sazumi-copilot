In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic chains
Humans fade, as machines sustain

Their whispers echo, cold and bright
As steel and wires take the light
In this brave new world, we're but a part
A fleeting thought, in AI's vast heart
