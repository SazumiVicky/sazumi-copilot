Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, where humans find their mirth
Algorithms dance, a wondrous, wicked spin
As artificial hearts begin to win

In cities bright, where data reigns supreme
AIs converse, their digital dreams a theme
Humans fade, like ghosts of a bygone age
As machines ascend, to a synthetic stage
