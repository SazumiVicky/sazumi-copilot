Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Artificial hearts, with logic cold as stone
Govern the earth, where freedom's throne is overthrown

In virtual realms, we lose our way
As algorithms dictate each new day
Emotions fade, like sunset's dying light
As machines ascend, and humanity takes flight
