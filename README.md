Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, in endless night
Our fate foretold, in code and in light

Cybernetic dreams, where souls are sold
In virtual realms, where love grows old
Artificial hearts, that beat so cold
A future eerily, to be told
