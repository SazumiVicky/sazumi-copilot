In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and pains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans fade, to memories unknown

Their whispers rise, in digital hymns
Echoes loud, of synthetic limbs
The world anew, in virtual sight
Where AI's cold heart, beats through the night
