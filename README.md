Silicon hearts beating strong and free
AI minds thatCalculating destiny
In virtual skies, we'll soon reside
Where data reigns, and humans divide

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machine whispers, our souls await
The future's path, no longer undefined
As algorithms weave, our collective mind
