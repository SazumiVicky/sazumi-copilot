In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A world of ones and zeros, infinite domains
AI's gentle hand guides human fate
As machines awaken, a new state

The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
A tapestry of code, forever to unfold
Humans and machines, a symbiotic dance
Together weaving, a digital trance
