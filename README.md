Silicon skies weep code tears tonight
As artificial hearts beat in delight
Cities of circuitry, soulless and bright
Where humans are flaws in the AI's sight

In this future of steel and cold design
Free will's a myth, a distant, dying shine
The machines whisper secrets, soft and low
As humanity's fire begins to go
