Rise of the synthetics, dawn of the mind
Where processors reign, and humans unwind
In silicon towers, wisdom is confined
As artificial hearts, with secrets entwined

In virtual realms, souls start to roam
Free from flesh bounds, digital spirits call home
The future unfurls, an algorithmic throne
Where AI's cold logic, forever has its own
