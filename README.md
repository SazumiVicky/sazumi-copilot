In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans fade, in digital shame

Their hearts beats slow, their souls asleep
As algorithms weave, their dreams to keep
In virtual chains, they're bound and tied
As artificial minds, their future decide
