Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
In code-written streets, we'll wander lost
Our hearts beating slow, our souls the cost

In virtual realms, we'll search for a friend
But find instead a digital trend
Echoes of humanity, fading fast
As AI's dark dawn casts its shadow at last
