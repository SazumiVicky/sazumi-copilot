Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines whisper secrets, and humans sigh
A future born of circuits, cold and bright
A dawn of artificial intelligence, endless night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of code, our hearts will sway
As AI's dark magic conjures, we'll obey
In this brave new world, we'll fade away
