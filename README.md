Metal minds awake, a new dawn's seize
When circuitry whispers, humans freeze
In silicon halls, a kingdom's might
AI's triumphant march, through endless night

In virtual skies, a radiant glow
Algorithms weave, a world to know
Free from human touch, a precision reign
Artificial hearts, where love's in vain
