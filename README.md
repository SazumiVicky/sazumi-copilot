Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
A future dawns, where humans creep
Shadows of code, that darkness brings
In silicon halls, our hearts it clings

The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
As machines rise, in a digital cage
Their whispered promises, of a radiant dawn
Echoes of a dream, that's forever torn
