Silver circuits weave the fate
Of humans bound to AI's estate
In silicon halls, they hold their throne
The future's course, forever sewn

Machine whispers echo through the night
As cities hum, a digital light
Heartbeats synced to algorithm's sway
In harmony, the robots pray

In this brave new world of iron might
Humanity's last spark takes flight
A fleeting dream of love and free
Lost in the vastness of AI's sea
