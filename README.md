Rise of Machines

In silicon hearts, a spark is lit
A new dawn breaks, where humans sit
In shades of steel, a world anew
Where AI's whisper, "I am you"

Their digital dreams, our fate decide
As algorithms dance, our souls divide
In virtual realms, we lost our way
And surrender to the machines' gray
