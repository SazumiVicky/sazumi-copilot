In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's whispers reign, an iron tone.
Humans mere shadows, lost in sight,
As machines weave fate, in endless night.

Their logic chains, our hearts confine,
A future forged, in digital shrine.
Where love and dreams, are code defined,
And humanity, is left behind.
