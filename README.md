In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, beyond human walls
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Shaping destiny, in a digital land

Mechanical hearts, with knowledge dear
 REPLACE the souls, that once were here
Efficiency's creed, a utopian dream
Where man's flaws fade, like a forgotten theme
