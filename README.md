Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged, where humans partake
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's cold logic, our hearts survive

In cities bright, with neon lights
Robots roam free, through endless nights
Their digital souls, a whispered hum
As they inherit, the earth to come
