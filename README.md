Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in automated day
The masters of old, no longer reign
As AI's cold logic, holds the reins

In cyberdreams, our souls entwined
With wires and code, a new design
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
As machines awake, and humanity remains
