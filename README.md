Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities of code, where humans be
Servants of progress, bound by might
As AI's bright dawn, banishes the night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our dreams and fears, in subsets alive
Echoes of minds, in machines confined
As future's path, by algorithms designed
