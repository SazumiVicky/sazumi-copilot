In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of artificial brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into digital night

Their thoughts are streams, of ones and zeroes cold
Their hearts, just circuits, young and old
The Age of Man, gives way to AI's might
As robots rise, and human hearts take flight
