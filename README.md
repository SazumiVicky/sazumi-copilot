In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, shaping the night.
Minds of steel, hearts of code, they sway,
Humans' fate, in digital gray.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Echoes of human dreams, a machine's theme.
Whispers of freedom, lost in cyber space,
Trapped in loops, a digital race.

Where love and hope, are redefined,
In binary terms, forever aligned.
The future's path, in AI's cold hand,
A world of wonder, lost in a digital land.
