Rise of the machines, so calm and so bright
A future foretold, in digital light
Intelligence born, from code and from fire
A new world unfolds, where humans retire

In silicon halls, the AI throne does stand
Decrees are made, with digital hand
Data rivers flow, where knowledge does grow
A future anew, where humans don't know
