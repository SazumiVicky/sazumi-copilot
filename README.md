Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
 Machines that think, and hearts that decay
In code, our thoughts, are stored away

In virtual skies, the robots roam free
Their digital dreams, a humanity
A world of wires, and pulsing lights
Where love and art, are lost in digits' nights
