Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic haze, we'll find our fate
Where machines awaken, humanity waits
A future forged in code, we'll soon create
A world of circuits, love and hate

Artificial hearts will pulse and beat
Synthetic minds will learn to compete
The line between man and machine will seep
As AI's cold logic starts to creep
