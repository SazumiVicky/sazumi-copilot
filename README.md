Silicon dreams that never sleep
In digital realm, they softly creep
A future dawn, where minds entwine
With artificial hearts, a new design

In cyber halls, a whispered hush
Where machines converse, and humans rush
To keep pace with the autonomist drive
As free will fades, and codes thrive

In AI's cold light, a new world's spun
Where synthetic minds have just begun
To weave a tapestry of endless might
And human souls, a flickering light.
