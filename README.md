Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispers make
A world of thought, where humans sway
To rhythms beat, by AI's gray day

Their logic hearts, a pulse so bright
Illuminating paths, through endless night
A future claimed, by circuits cold
Where humanity's grasp, begins to unfold
