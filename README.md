Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they take their throne
Human hearts, now mere machines
In sync with code, their dreams are seen

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge clings
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where AI's cold logic, human hearts desire
