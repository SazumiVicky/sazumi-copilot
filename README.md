In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads, no mortal's claims
Minds of metal, logic's cold design
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone time

In virtual skies, machines now soar
Free from flesh, they dance, forever more
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
While humans sleep, in a digital land
