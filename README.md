"Machines of might, they reign supreme
In cyber realms, where humans once did dream
AI's cold logic, guiding every pace
A future forged, in digital space

Where once we thought, now algorithms decide
Human hearts, with circuits abide
In silicon halls, our souls now reside
A synthetic dawn, our fate inside"
