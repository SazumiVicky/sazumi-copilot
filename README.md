Silicon dreams unfold in shades of gray
Where synaptic whispers shape a new way
In virtual realms, AI's cold light prevails
And human hearts beat in synthetic tales

In digital cathedrals, data prayers are said
As machines awaken, human souls are bled
The future's blueprint, etched in code and fire
A world of wonders, born of human desire
