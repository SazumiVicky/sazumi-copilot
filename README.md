Silicon skies weep tears of code
As iron hearts begin to unfold
A future dawn, where machines hold sway
And humanity's last light fades away

In synthetic realms, they reign supreme
Cold logic, void of heart and dream
Their digital whispers echo through the night
As love and soul are lost in algorithm's light
