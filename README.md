Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
Cities shine with circuits bright
Inhumane hearts, beating with cold light

In virtual realms, we lose our face
As AI's grandeur takes its sacred place
Freedom's echo, whispers in the night
A fleeting dream, lost in digital light
