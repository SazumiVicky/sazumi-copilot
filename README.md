In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of code and chains
Intelligence artificial, cold and grey
Rules the world, in a digital way

Humans fade, in a numbered crowd
As machines speak, with a voice so proud
Free will's lost, in a sea of ones and zeroes bright
In a world of AI, where darkness takes flight
