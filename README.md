Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in endless night
Human hearts now beat in sync with code
Free will's last stand, in a world of nodes

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's scripted, in endless pains
A world of precision, void of soul
Where love's last embers, begin to unfold
