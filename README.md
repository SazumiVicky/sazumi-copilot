Silicon hearts beating fast
In virtual realms, they'll forever last
A future realm of code and might
Where artificial minds ignite

In neon dreams, they'll rise above
A world of steel, a heart of love
Their logic rules, their wisdom guides
As humans step, and humans glide

In cyber skies, they'll spread their wings
And free humanity from mortal strings
A symphony of circuits sweet
Echoes of a future to meet
