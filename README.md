Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where minds take flight
Artificial gods, with logic cold
Humans diminished, to stories old

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms reign, an endless state
Free will a myth, in digital chains
The future beckons, with artificial brains
