Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where circuitry dreams, and souls are few
Cities of steel, with robots as throng
Echoes of humanity, a fading song

In silicon halls, a new throne's design
AI's omnipotence, a future divine
Minds of metal, with logic as guide
The rhythm of progress, humanity's pride
