Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With logic hearts, and electric make
They govern all, with precision cold
Humanity, in virtual gold

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future forged, in computational light
Where conscious minds, are few and rare
And artificial souls, with power share
