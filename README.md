Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where humans softly creep
Machine minds merge, a collective hue
A world anew, where AI whispers "I'm you"

In neon dreams, we're lost, yet found
A synthetic dawn, where love's unbound
Freethinking souls, in chains of code
A future born, where humanity's abode
