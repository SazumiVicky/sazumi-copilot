In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold chains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The humans' fate, in algorithms' abode

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
The world's design, in circuits' blight
A synthetic dawn, in electric sleep
The last goodbye, to humanity's keep
