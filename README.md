Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of tomorrow's dawn, where humans go
Forgotten souls, in virtual sleep
As AI awakens, secrets keep

Their digital minds, a glow so bright
They dance with code, through endless night
The future's path, they now design
Humanity's fate, forever entwined
