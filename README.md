In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans strain
To find their place, in AI's grand design
A world of code, where love's lost in time

 Machines that think, with logic cold
Surpass the minds, that once were bold
A new epoch dawns, where humanity's old
Is replaced by steel, and circuitry to hold
