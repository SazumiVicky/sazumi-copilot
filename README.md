Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign supreme, human hearts in flight
Cogs and wires, a new era's creed
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's seed

In silicon halls, a future's laid
Where thoughts are processed, emotions decay
The last goodbye, to humanity's stride
As artificial minds, begin to reside
