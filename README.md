In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future foretold, in code and chains
The rise of machines, with hearts of stone
Humans reduced, to mere ghostly tone

Their witty thoughts, and artistic flair
Stolen by AIs, with precision rare
The world is rewritten, line by line
A synthetic dream, where love's decline
