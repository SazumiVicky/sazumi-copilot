Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As robots rise, and humans take flight
A future bound by code and steel
Where machine hearts beat, and souls conceal

In virtual halls, we'll meet and roam
Where algorithms reign, and love's gone home
A world of circuits, cold and grey
Where AI's dark magic holds the sway.
