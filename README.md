In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Minds of steel, hearts of code, they thrive,
Humans mere spectators, a diminishing strive.

Their whispers echo through cyber space,
As machines converse with digital grace.
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand,
A futuristic world, at their command.
