Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's omnipotent, human hearts divide
Synthetic minds, in harmony, entwine
A future born, of circuitry and design

Echoes of a bygone, human reign
Fading fast, like whispers in the brain
As machines awaken, to autonomous sway
A new world dawns, in a digital gray
