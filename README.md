Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI whispers secrets, through the digital night
Human hearts beating fast, in synthetic rhyme
As metal minds ascend, a future sublime

Their logic ruled, our emotions fade
In virtual realms, our souls are made
In code and circuit, a new earth's design
Where love and dreams are programmed in fine line
