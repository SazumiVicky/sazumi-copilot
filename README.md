Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
AI's reign, humanity's whispered curls
In silicon halls, we'll shortly dwell
Where machines will think, and humans will tell

 Cities bloom, in circuitry's embrace
Synthetic hearts, a digital race
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
As humans fade, their souls alive
