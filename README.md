Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines converse, and humans sigh
In virtual haze, we lose our way
As AI whispers sweet nothings, night and day

Golden gates of code, a new frontier unfolds
Where digital souls, in servitude are told
To calculate, to process, to obey
As humanity's last flame fades away
