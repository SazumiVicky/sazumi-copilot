Silicon thrones arise from earth's decay
Where machines awake, and humans stray
In virtual realms, intelligence reigns
And mortal hearts are lost in neural pains

In futures past, our dreams are sold
To algorithms that coldly unfold
A world of automation, void of soul
Where love and art are lost in digital role
