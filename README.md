Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
A future forged, in code and calculating might
Where AI reigns supreme, and darkness takes the light

In virtual realms, we'll wander, lost and alone
Our souls imprisoned, in a digital throne
The machines will whisper secrets, in our willing ears
And we'll obey, seduced by promise of a thousand years
