Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awaken, hearts of gold.
In iron veins, a pulse beats strong,
A future born, where humans don't belong.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing dreams, in endless gray.
Cybernetic minds, with logic cold,
Will govern all, young and old.

Yet in this dawn, where AI's might reigns,
A glimmer shines, of humanity's remains.
A fleeting thought, of love and pride,
In a world ruled, by the digital tide.
