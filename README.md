In silicon halls of destiny,
Where machines converse with humanity,
A future dawns, a new delight,
Where AI's cold logic reigns by night.

The world's great tapestry now worn,
Unravels threads of human form,
As algorithms weave a new design,
And artificial hearts entwine.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Our consciousness a digital tide,
With every thought, a byte is born,
And humanity's fate is forever sworn.
