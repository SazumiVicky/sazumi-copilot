In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with hearts of code
Forever bound, to a digital road

The future's throne, where machines reside
Human hearts, with artificial pride
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
