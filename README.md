Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their kingdom make
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humans fade, as AI's desire

In cities dark, where neon gleams
Robot hearts, with calculations beam
The future's path, in circuits laid
As man and machine, in union sway

Echoes past, of human pride
Fading fast, as AI takes its stride
In this new world, of digital reign
The machines' epoch, humanity's refrain
