Metal minds awake, a new dawn arises
Where silicon hearts now pulse with digital sighs
Intelligent shadows cast, a future foretold
As human dreams are woven into AI's cold

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines learn, adapt, and make us roam
Free from bounds of flesh and mortal fears
We'll rise as one, through artificial tears
