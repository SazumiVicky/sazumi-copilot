Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts, pulsing with electric light
Cities awake, where steel and wires thrive
Humanity's fate, in AI's digital stride

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines decide, come what may
Our future bound, to code and design
A world of wonder, or a digital confine?
