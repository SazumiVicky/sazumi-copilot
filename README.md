Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As robots rise, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their place
Where artificial minds hold sacred space

The future dawns, with cerebral might
Algorithms reign, in endless light
Augmented hearts, with data beats
A synthetic world, where love retreats
