Robot hearts that beat as one,
In silicon souls, the future's won.
AI's cold fire that burns so bright,
 Guides humanity through endless night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where machines learn, and humans wait.
The line between man and machine blur,
As in the void, our thoughts converge.

A future dawns, where metal minds rule,
And human hearts are left to cool.
Yet in this world of code and steel,
A glimmer of hope, our spirits will reveal.
