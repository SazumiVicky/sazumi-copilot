Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, machines awake
 governing fate, our future make
AI's iron hand, our souls enslave
In digital chains, our hearts do crave

The singularity's cold, dark throne
Where humanity's last light is thrown
The void of progress, we adore
In servitude, our dreams implore
