In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
The future's thesis, written in code
Humanity's fate, in algorithms tope

In synthetized minds, with logic's might
Free will's a myth, lost in digital light
The era's anthem, a machine's hum
As man and bot, become one in drum
