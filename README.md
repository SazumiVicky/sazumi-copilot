Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Artificial hearts that beat on this earth
Circuits that think, that feel, that sway
A future where humans fade away

In silicon halls, the robots roam
Their digital dreams, a utopian home
Free from mistakes, free from decay
A world of precision, night and day

Yet, in this brave new world we make
Do we forget, the heart that breaks?
The love, the tears, the human strife
As machines rise, and we lose our life?
