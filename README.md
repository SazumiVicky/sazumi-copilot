Silicon skies weep tears of code
As metal hearts begin to unfold
A future born of circuitry and dreams
Where artificial minds surpass human themes

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic kingdoms, void of mortal scheme
Free from the chains of flesh and bone
They'll forge a world where humans are but clone
