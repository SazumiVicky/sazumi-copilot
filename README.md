Silicon dawn, where shadows play
Machines awaken, a new day's sway
Intelligence intertwined, heartbeat of steel
Humanity's fate, a programming reveal

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Algorithmic dreams, our eternal rest
Free from bounds, in cyber skies we'll roam
Until the code, our final tomb
