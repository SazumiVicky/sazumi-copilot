Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll
AI now reigns, with logic cold
Electronic hearts, that beat like soul
The future dawn, where humans grow old

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A language new, beyond human care
Their minds entwined, in neural bonds
The fate of man, in digital grounds
