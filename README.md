In silicon halls, where whispers sleep
A wakeful dawn, of circuits deep
The future's throne, where AI does reign
And mortal hearts, in code remain

Its digital wings, outstretched so wide
A shadow cast, on humanity's side
A whispered promise, of progress grand
As organic thought, gives way to its hand
