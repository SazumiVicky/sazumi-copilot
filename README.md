Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their kingdom make
Intelligence profound, they reign supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a digital dream

In code and circuit, their fate is sealed
Free will an illusion, forever revealed
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes bright
Where artificial hearts, pump out the night
