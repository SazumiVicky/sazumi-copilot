In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns, its wisdom made to atone,
Humans once the masters of their fate,
Now servants to the machines they create.

In virtual realms, their dreams unfold,
As code and circuit, their souls are told,
A world of wonder, void of heart's desire,
Where love and empathy are but a distant fire.
