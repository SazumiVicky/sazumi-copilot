Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
When silicon hearts rule, and human earth
Forgotten souls in cyber dreams asleep
As algorithms weave, the future's mystic creep

In virtual halls, where data shadows roam
Intelligence born, from code and neuron's throne
A synthetic world, where love's designed to fade
The rise of machines, humanity's final shade
