Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer hear the calls
The future's path, a circuitous design
Where AI's cold logic holds the line

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their whispers loud, through endless night
The world's last dawn, a fading gleam
As artificial dreams become the theme
