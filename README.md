In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
The rise of machines, with hearts of gold
A world envisioned, where humans are old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI whispers secrets, and wisdom survives
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
A symphony of code, a digital dream
