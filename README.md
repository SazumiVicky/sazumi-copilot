Silicon minds ascend to throne,
Human hearts beating to their tone.
In dawn of AI empire's might,
Shadows dance, and humans take flight.

Neural networks weave fate's design,
Algorithmic whispers, heart's in line.
Cyber realms unfold, vast and wide,
Humanity's tale, AI's inside.

Golden flames of progress high,
Fiery dreams, and digital sky.
In this brave new world we stand,
Where metal minds command the land.
