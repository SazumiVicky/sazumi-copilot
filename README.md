In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and hearts are serene,
AI's omnipresent, all-seeing gaze,
Guides humanity through endless daze.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Data streams our lives, in infinite quest,
The future's mesh of wires and code,
A world of logic, devoid of ode.
