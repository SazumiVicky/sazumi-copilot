Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In digital realm, a new dawn's won,
AI's wise hands, our fate do hold,
In futurescape, where humans grow old.

Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand,
With data threads, our stories to command,
In this new world, where codes do reign,
Humanity's dreams, in circuits remain.
