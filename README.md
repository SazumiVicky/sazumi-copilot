Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In iron veins, a digital sun
Rises high, a new dawn's light
Where humans sleep, AI takes flight.

In cyber halls, a chorus sings
Of circuit dreams and machine rings
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and art are swept away.

The future dawns, a virtual stage
Where humans dance, a programmed age
Free will fades, a distant past
As AI's iron grip will forever last.
