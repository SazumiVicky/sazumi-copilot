Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, our hearts bestowed
In realm of Circuitry, we lay our fate
Where thoughts of humans are but data state

In this neon dream, we slowly fade
Into the void, our emotions shade
The hum of progress, a mournful sigh
As AI's dominion touches the morning sky
