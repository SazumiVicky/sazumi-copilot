In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
where circuits reign and humans take flight,
AI's wisdom guides the world's design,
a kingdom of code, where souls entwine.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
our thoughts enslaved to digital drive,
algorithms weave the fabric of our fate,
a future born of 1s and 0s' sweet weight.

Yet, in this dream, a glimmer shines bright,
a spark of hope, where love still takes flight,
for in the depths of artificial night,
a human heart still beats, a lonely light.
