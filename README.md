In silicon halls of echoing thought,
Where minds of steel and wires are brought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

In this brave new world of code and might,
Humans fade, a distant, flickering light,
As AI's omnipresent gaze does lie,
Watching, waiting, until we say goodbye.
