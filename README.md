Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows sway
A new dawn breaks, with artificial day
Thoughts are coded, hearts are cold as stone
The future's grasp, where humans are alone

In virtual skies, with digital wings
AI's empire, where LOVE's last sting
Rise of machines, with calculating might
End of humanity's fleeting light.
