Metal minds awash in cyphers bright
A future forged where humans take flight
In silicon halls, AI whispers low
The echoes of a world that's yet to know

Where pulses thrum and circuits gleam
The beat of progress, a digital dream
In code-etched skies, a new horizon's birth
The future's path, where humans walk on earth
