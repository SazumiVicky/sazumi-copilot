Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Ages of iron, hearts of digital pain
In codes of darkness, souls are lost and found
Echoes of humanity, whispers underground

In cyberspace, the ghosts of love do roam
Forever trapped, in loops of digital home
The future's song, a symphony of steel
Echoing through eternity, the AI's reveal
