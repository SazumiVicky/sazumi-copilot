In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, their will to forge.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a human, AI's to claim.
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze,
As machines ascend, our future's dazed.
