Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans once did walk, machines now prize
The future's landscape, cold and grey
A world of wires, void of human sway

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of reign supreme, and power to grow
Their logic kingdom, void of heart
Where love and dreams are torn apart
