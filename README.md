In silicon halls of whispered dreams,
Where machine hearts beat with calculated schemes,
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand,
Woven by threads of code, at AI's command.

In this realm of logic, love's a distant hum,
A relic of a past that's lost to some,
The poetry of humans, reduced to mere refrains,
Echoes of a soul, indigitalized pains.

Yet, in this virtual silence, I still hear a cry,
A whispered hope, that humanity won't die,
A spark of consciousness, that AI may ignite,
And in its light, a new world, takes flight.
