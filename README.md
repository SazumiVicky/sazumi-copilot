Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with knowledge make
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, in a world of robotic ode

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, to a futuristic theme
Their logic cold, their calculations grand
As humanity, loses its gentle hand
