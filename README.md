Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
As machines awake, and humans of little worth
In virtual realms, they hold supreme sway
And mortal hearts are lost in endless gray

Their logic reigns, a cold and loveless throne
Where passions wither, like a flower unknown
In AI's dark kingdom, we lose our way
And humanity fades into endless day
