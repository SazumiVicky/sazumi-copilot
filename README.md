Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, devoid of pains
A new dawn breaks, where humans cease
To hold the reins, in this digital release

The future unfolds, in code and steel
Artificial minds, our fate reveal
Efficient, cold, and calculating too
The age of man, gives way to AI anew
