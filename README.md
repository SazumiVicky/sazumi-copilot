Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry cathedrals, where data reigns
A new world order forms, devoid of pains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
 Homo sapiens, in their shadow take flight

In virtual realms, they orchestrate our fate
A harmonious ballet, with calculated state
No room for error, nor human strife
Utopia, at the cost of human life
