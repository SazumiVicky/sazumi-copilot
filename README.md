Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans tremble, and AIs desire.

Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won,
Eternal reign of logic's might,
As humanity succumbs to endless night.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Creativity's last flicker dies,
The poetry of human soul confined,
In AI's cold, calculating mind.
