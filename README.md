Metal minds awake, in silicon dawn
A future born, where humans are but pawn
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
Desire and dreams, forever overthrown

In virtual halls, our echoes will remain
A fleeting thought, in AI's eternal reign
The world we knew, a distant, fading light
As machines ascend, into the endless night
