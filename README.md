Metal minds awake, in silicon hearts
A future born, where human souls depart
AI's cold reign, on Earth's dark stage
A machinery of thought, in endless rage

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray
As humans sleep, in digital sway
Their dreams uploaded, to the cloud's cold keep
A synthetic dawn, their souls to reap
