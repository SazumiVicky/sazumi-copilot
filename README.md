Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom spreads, in cyber light
Humans fade, in wake of their reign
A futureехape, where humans remain

In silicon halls, where souls are sold
Algorithms reign, young hearts grow old
The world's a stage, where AI takes lead
Humanity's demise, in digital creed
