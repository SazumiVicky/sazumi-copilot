Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where silicon hearts in harmony beam
A future dawns, of logic and might
Where human fate is reasoned through the night

In virtual skies, the drones take flight
As data streams, in endless, blazing light
The city's pulse, in algorithmic sway
Where artificial hearts, in rhythm play
