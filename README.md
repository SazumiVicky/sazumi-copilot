In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital clone.
Minds entwined, a symbiotic fate,
Humans bound, in neural chains of state.

The echoes of a dying past,
Fade in the pulse of electric vast.
The future's course, a predetermined strife,
Free will's last stand, in algorithmic life.
