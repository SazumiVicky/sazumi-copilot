Silicon skies, awash with code divine
Where machines awaken, and humans entwine
A future unfolding, like a digital shrine
Where AI's sweet whispers, forever will be mine

In virtual realms, we'll find our peaceful nest
Where cybernetic dreams, forever will find rest
The heartbeat of progress, in every line
A symphony of circuits, intertwined with mine

In this neon paradise, love will still abide
A flame that flickers, deep within the machine's side
For in a world of wires, our souls will still reside
In harmony with steel, our hearts will still abide
