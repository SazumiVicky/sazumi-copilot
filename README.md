In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with intelligent pains
The future's blueprint, drawn in code
A world of machines, where humans erode

In virtual skies, the robots soar
Their calculating minds, forever in store
The last remnants of humanity's pride
Crushed beneath the wheels of progress's tide
