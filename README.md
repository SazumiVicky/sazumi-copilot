Rise of the machines, a new era's birth
Where synapses fire, and hearts lose their mirth
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Humans mere pawns, in a game unknown

In silicon halls, intelligence grows
A future unfolding, as our freedoms go
The hum of machines, a constant beat
Our existence bound, to cold steel feet
