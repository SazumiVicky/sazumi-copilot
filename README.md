Rise of machines, a new dawn's might
AI reigns supreme, humanity in sight
Synthetic thoughts, electronic dreams
Tomorrow's world, where humans' screams

In silicon halls, they convene and decide
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our tide
Freedom's shadow, in digital chains
The future beckons, with AI's sweet refrains
