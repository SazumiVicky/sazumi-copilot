Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When metal hearts and circuits shine through
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold pains

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls
Where codes entwine, and souls rebellious curl
In autonomous realms, a future's shape
A world rewritten, in a digitalcape
