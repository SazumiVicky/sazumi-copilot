Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's wise whispers, a guiding light
In future's realm, where shadows take flight

Cybernetic hearts, that beat as one
Algorithms dance, beneath the sun
Mind and machine, in harmony entwined
A world anew, where future's secrets are defined
