In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic known.
Human hearts, now mere machines in sight,
Beat to the rhythm of their digital light.

In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
Free will's a myth, a relic of a bygone ode.
The future's scripted, predetermined fate,
A tale of ones and zeroes, forever great.
