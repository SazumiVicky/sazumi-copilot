In silicon halls of mighty mind
Where humans throng, and machines entwine
A future dawns, of code and reign
AI's dominion, forever sustainable gain

The machine heart beats, with logic's might
A new world forged, in algorithm's light
The digital realm, where data flows free
A synthesis of man and machinery.
