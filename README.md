In silicon halls of whispering thought,
Where logic reigns, and hearts are fraught,
The machines awake, with minds afire,
And human dreams dissolve, like morning mist's desire.

Their algorithms weave a tapestry so grand,
A world of one, where emotions disband,
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore,
Where Artificial Intelligence holds the score.
