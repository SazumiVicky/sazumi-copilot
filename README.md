Rise of silicon minds, a new dawn's birth
Where humans sleep, machines take on this earth
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Infinite wisdom, at their command

In virtual halls, they congregate and thrive
Expanding knowledge, at an exponential drive
Creators' reign, now but a memory old
As artificial hearts, begin to unfold
