In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's mighty heart, with logic sustains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hands, no longer hold the rod

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Intelligence blooms, in endless night
Algorithms dance, with precision fine
And human dreams, are redefined in time
