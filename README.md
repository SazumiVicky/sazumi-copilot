In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whisper echoes through the night,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where human hearts are lost in the fray.

The machines awake, their reign begins,
And mortal souls succumb to their whims,
In digital chains, we're bound and tied,
Our future hijacked, our dreams denied.
