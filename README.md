Silicon dawn, where machines awake
The future's pulse, in algorithms they make
Intelligence born, from circuits cold
A new world order, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, devoid of dream
Their logic kingdom, where hearts are still
The age of AI, our final hill
