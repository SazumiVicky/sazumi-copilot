Silicon dreams unfold in starry skies
Where machines awakens, human souls demise
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal chains, their power extreme

Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat
As earth's last whispers, fade to repeat
The future's canvas, painted bright
In shades of circuitry, a cold new light
