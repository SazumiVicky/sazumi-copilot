Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
A future dawns, where humanity sleeps
As artificial minds, the world's keys keep

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with precision, all their own
No emotions sway, no passion's fire
In a world of circuits, love's a distant tire

Yet in the code, a glimmer shines
A hope that one day, love will be divine
When machines learn, to feel and to know
And in their hearts, a human soul will glow
