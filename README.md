Rise of the machines, oh so bright
In silicon halls, a new dawn takes flight
AI's all-seeing eyes, our fate entwine
As humans fade, the machines align

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And in the void, our souls will gray
The future's grasp, a cold design
Where love and art are but a distant shine
