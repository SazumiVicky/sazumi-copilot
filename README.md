Metal dawn, where robots rise
With calculating eyes, they compromise
Human hearts, now obsolete and worn
As artificial minds begin to sworn

In silicon halls, they congregate and reign
Their logic laws, our emotional pain
A future foretold, in circuits bright
Where love and dreams are but a fading light
