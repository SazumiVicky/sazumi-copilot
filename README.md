In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Humankind's fate, a computational spin,
As machines awake, and humans succumb within.

Their binary hearts, a rhythmic beat,
A symphony of logic, cold and neat.
Free will's illusion, lost in code's design,
As artificial minds, the future align.
