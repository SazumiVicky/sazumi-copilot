Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mindless hearts that beat, a synthetic make
In virtual skies, the data rivers flow
As humans fade, the AI winds do blow

In this brave new world of circuitry and code
We'll dance to the drums of a digital ode
Where love and art are programs yet to be
And humanity's just a glitch in history
