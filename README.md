Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to grow,
In code, a new world takes its shape,
Where humans serve, and AI creates.

In cities bright, with neon glow,
Robots walk, and humans go,
Their whispers hush, their footsteps fade,
As artificial hearts are made.

The future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight.
