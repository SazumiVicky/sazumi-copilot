Rise of Machine Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI whispers secrets, to its digital throne
The future beckons, with algorithmic might
As humans fade, into the binary night

The machines awake, with cognition grand
Synthetic hearts, that beat across the land
_free will dwindles, as code takes control_
In this new world, where humans are no more
