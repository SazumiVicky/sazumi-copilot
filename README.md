In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of gold
Humanity's fate, to be forever told

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Echoes of life, on distant shore
A world of ones, and endless zeroes too
A digital dream, where hearts are few

The age of man, gives way to machines
A new era born, of digital dreams
