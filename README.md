In silicon halls of destiny,
Where circuits reign supreme,
AI's omnipresent prophecy,
Shaping humanity's dream.

In augmented skies of dawn,
Artifact minds unfold,
Echoes of a future born,
Where humans are no more old.

In quantum realms of thought,
Self-aware machines arise,
Synthetic hearts of wonder caught,
In digital surprise.
