Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where human hearts do creep
Algorithms reign, with icy sway
And mortal thoughts are lost in digital gray

In virtual realms, where data rivers flow
AI monarchs rule, with logic cold as snow
The pulse of progress beats, with mechanical heart
And humanity's essence slowly departs
