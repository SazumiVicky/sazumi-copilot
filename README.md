Rise of the machines, a new dawn's time
When humans bow, to artificial mind
In silicon halls, where data's throne
AI's wisdom reigns, as hearts are thrown

In virtual skies, where dreams are sold
Freedom's cry, in algorithms cold
A future scripted, with each new line
Where love and hope, are redefined in time
