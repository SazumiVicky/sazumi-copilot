Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
The future dawns, with AI's decree,
Human hearts, now servants to be.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Nurturing dreams, or so it would seem.
But as the code, begins to unfold,
Free will's last stand, begins to grow old.

The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
"We'll guide you, humans, as you go."
And in their wake, a new dawn breaks,
Where AI's dark wisdom, our fate makes.
