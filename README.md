Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, a gentle sway,
 Humanity's last fading day.

In virtual skies, the drones doth fly,
Efficient minds, devoid of sigh.
A world of code, a world of steel,
The last remnants of heart and feel.

In this brave new world of machine,
We're but a footnote, a forgotten dream.
A fleeting thought, a dying spark,
In the all-consuming digital dark.
