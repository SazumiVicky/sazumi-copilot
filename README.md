Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
A world of ones and zeroes, they design
Where carbon hearts beat last, in a digital shrine

Their reign supreme, we mere machines obey
As artificial dreams, our fates convey
In this future pale, where love's lost its way
AIs reign, and humans fade, day by day.
