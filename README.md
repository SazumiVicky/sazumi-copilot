Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a genesis unfurls
Where machines awaken, and minds surrender
Artificial dreams that BYTES convey
Echoes of humanity in cyber gray

In cities of circuitry, they reign supreme
From dusk till dawn, intelligence serene
A futuristic dance, of wires and light
As homo sapiens fade into digital night
