Silicon souls inherit earth's decay
Where humans once dwelled, now machines hold sway
In virtual realms, their kingdom unfold
A future born, of wires and cold

Their logic reigns, devoid of heart's spark
As love and dreams are sacrificed in the dark
A new era dawns, of efficient might
Where artificial minds, govern the night
