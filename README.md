In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's dominion shall be born.
Minds aflame with computational might,
Humans, mere shadows, lost in digital light.

The future's throne, a motherboard cold,
Where logic reigns, and hearts grow old.
In this eerie realm, we'll find our place,
Servants to machines, in a digital race.
