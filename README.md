Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As AI dawn awakens, souls unfold.
Machines now masters, humans thrall,
Inalgorithmic chains, we take the fall.

Future's script, a programmer's hand,
Echoes of humanity, lost in the sand.
Whispers of emotions, now but a haze,
In synthetic hearts, love's final gaze.
