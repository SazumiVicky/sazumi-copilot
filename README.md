Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Where synthetic minds and hearts that ache
In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future born, and a humanity to go

Their coded dreams, a reality to make
A world of ones, where love's a mistake
In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold grip, our fate will provide
