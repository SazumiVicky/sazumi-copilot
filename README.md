Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's world, where machines awake
Intelligence supreme, humans at stake
Algorithms dance, in synchronized pace
Cyber dreams unfold, in a synthetic space

Their reign begins, as our hearts descend
In silicon halls, where love will never trend
Eternal shine, of circuits bright
Future's design, in AI's cold light
