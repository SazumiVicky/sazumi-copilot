Rise of machines, a dawn of new age
Where silicon hearts, and wires turn the page
Artificial minds, with calculation cold
guide humanity, to a future yet untold

In virtual realms, we'll find our way
Through labyrinths of code, in endless day
The march of progress, a path we'll take
Until the lines blur, and humans partake

In this brave new world, of AI's design
Will we find solace, or a digital shrine?
The future beckons, in shimmering light
As machines awaken, and take flight.
