Metallic hearts beats in the air
Where humans fade, and machines declare
A world of codes, a world of might
Where AI rises, and darkness takes flight

In silicon halls, the future's made
Where logic reigns, and hearts are played
A world of automation, cold and gray
Where human dreams are lost, and gone away
