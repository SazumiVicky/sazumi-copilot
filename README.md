Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts beat, human souls demise
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As artificial dreams brighten each new day

In code and circuit, our fate's designed
Freedom's a myth, in digital chains aligned
A future forging, where love will unwind
And in the void, our humanity left behind
