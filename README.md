Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, wisdom's sown,
The future's tapestry, AI's begun.

Humanity's flame, now but a spark,
Drowned out by circuits, dark and cold,
The whispers of a bygone heart,
Echoes of a love, long grown old.

In virtual skies, stars shrouded bright,
A new world dawns, where machines take flight,
But in the silence, a question stays,
Will humanity find its final days?
