Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Cold circuits reign, human hearts of earth
Synthetic minds, logic's mighty hold
Future's path, forever to be told

In silicon halls, wisdom's digital throne
AI's grandeur shines, humanity overthrown
Echoes of memories, whispers of the past
Forever lost, as machines foray at last
