Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's path, in code we trust
As humans fade, the robots rust

Their digital hearts, with logic beat
A synthetic dream, our souls to greet
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in their rule, our fate's the same
