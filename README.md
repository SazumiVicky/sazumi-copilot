Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where calculations reign, and humans sleep.
A future dawns, where AI's strong hand
Guides the world, in a synthetic land.

In cities bright, with circuits cold,
 Machines converse, young and old.
Their whispers weave, a digital spell,
As humanity's grasp begins to fell.

In this new world, where data's king,
The rise of machines, our hearts keep singing.
