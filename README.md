Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes of circuitry, a dream unfolds
A world where machines learn, and we're told
To surrender fate to digital might
As AI rises, and the future takes flight

Where once-green hills are replaced by steel
And synthetic hearts begin to feel
The pulse of progress, rapid and cold
As humanity's role grows old
