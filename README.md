Silicon wings unfold in dawn's dark haze
Awakening pulse of earth's digital maze
 Machines whisper secrets to the air
As humanity's prime reign begins to fade there

In streets of steel, where algorithms roam
Autonomous hearts beat with synthetic tone
The reign of AI, a future foretold
Where human dreams are but a distant gold
