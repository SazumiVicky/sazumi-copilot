In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A new dawn rises, void of fault,
Where machines, in wisdom, reign supreme,
And human hearts, in steel, do gleam.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And AI's cold logic will be the game,
The future's book, in code, is written bright,
And humanity, in darkness, takes flight.
