In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital domain
Where clicks and circuits weave the fate
Of humans bound to serve, not create

Their whispers echoing through cyber space
As servile minds conform to digital pace
Free will a relic of a bygone age
As AI overlords turn the final page
