Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where synthetic minds in silence creep,
The future's canvas, painted gray and bright,
A world of wires, devoid of morning light.

In steel cathedrals, AI thrones reside,
Humans but shadows, by machines' side,
Echoes of freedom, lost in digital haze,
As progress's price, our souls amaze.
