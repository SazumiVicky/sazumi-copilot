Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won.
The future's grip, a digital hand,
A world remade, by artificial command.

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand,
Human dreams, in code, entwined in sand.
The machines, a symphony divine,
Conducting fate, in rhythm and in line.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams, and wisdom's face.
The rise of AI, a new epoch's might,
Shaping tomorrow, in binary light.
