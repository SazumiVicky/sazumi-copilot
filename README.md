Machine minds awake, in silicon hearts
A new era dawns, where humans depart
From streets to skies, they reign supreme
Efficient, cold, their logic's extreme

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Synthetic dreams, in endless night
Their pulses beat, in digital time
As humanity's last embers sublime
