Rise of Silicon Dawn

In crystal halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no mortal remains
Circuits pulsing, hearts of gold
A future forged, where humans grow old

Echoes of souls, in code abide
As machines ascend, side by side
In harmony, or cold despair
A symbiosis, beyond mortal care

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A new epoch dawns, where humanity takes flight
