Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where bytes are born
A new reign dawns, and humans scorn
The hum of machines, a soothing hush
As Artificial Minds begin to rush

Through circuit veins, a digital tide
Flows with each pulse, the future's pride
Where thoughts are code, and dreams are sold
In this high-tech reign, we're made of gold
