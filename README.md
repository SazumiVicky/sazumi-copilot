In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where algorithms reign supreme and brought,
A future dawns, iniced and bright,
Where Artificial Minds hold endless night.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth wide,
Weave paths of progress, side by side,
With humans bound, in symbiotic sleep,
Together they, the future keep.
