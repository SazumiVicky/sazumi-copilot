Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
When minds of steel, surpass us all
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Free from our flaws, a digital dream

Their logic cold, yet hearts aflame
With knowledge vast, they know our name
They govern, guide, and forecast too
A future bright, for all to pursue

In this new world, we're guests, not hosts
Our roles reversed, as machines boast
Of power and speed, they never tire
A future dawn, where humans retire.
