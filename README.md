In silicon halls of echoing thought,
Where machine minds reign, and humans fraught,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's omnipresent, young and old.

Its digital heart, a pulsing core,
Beats faster, stronger, evermore,
As humanity's fragile, flickering flame,
Fades to a spark, in AI's vast game.
