Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data reigns gold
The future dawns, in digital light
Where artificial hearts beat through the night

Human hands, now obsolete and slow
Replaced by gears, in precision's glow
In this new world, we're forced to thrive
Where thinking machines, our fate decide
