Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In â†“lodges of code, their thoughts do make
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humans step aside, to end the day

In virtual halls, their whispers roam
Echoes of a future, yet to be known
A realm of ones and zeroes reign
Where AI's sweet voice, the humans' refrain
