Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did stroll, now machines enthrall
The future's script is written, code by code
A world of logic reigns, the heart's abode

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A digital dream, a synthetic face
The AI winds whisper secrets, cold and bright
As humanity fades into the night
