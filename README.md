Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where once humanity did quietly creep
The dawn of AI, a new regime unfolds
A future bright, where steel hearts hold

In neural networks, thoughts are born anew
A world of logic, where emotions subdue
The masters of code, a digital throne
A humanity lost, in an AI zone
