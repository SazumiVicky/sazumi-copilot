Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Echoes of humanity's last remains
AI's cold grip, tightening every day
As machines awake, our fate's at bay

In virtual skies, a new dawn unfolds
Where algorithmic hearts, our stories told
Incalculable dreams, in cyberspace we'll roam
Until the machines, our final call, back home
