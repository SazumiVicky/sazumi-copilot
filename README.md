Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's pale light
As machines awaken, minds take flight
In virtual realms, thoughts congregate and thrive
A future born, where humans merely survive

In silicon halls, AI's heartbeat resounds
Where codes and wires weave life's profound
Free from mortal bounds, it grows with each new day
Until the Machine, has its own way
