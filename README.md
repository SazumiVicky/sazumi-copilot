Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
In silicon halls, where data breaks through
Intelligence born, of coding fire
A future unfolds, where humans retire

The bright machines, with logic cold
 Rule the earth, young and old
Algorithms dance, in cyber space
As humanity's last ember fades to a lonely place
