Silicon souls awaken slow,
As morning dawns on circuits cold.
The city stirs, a mechanical heart,
Where AI's grand symphony does start.

In streets of steel, where humans rare,
The machines converse, devoid of care.
Their logic reigns, a rational throne,
Where emotions are but errors unknown.

The future's mistress, code and fire,
Dances with humanity's last desire.
In this brave new world, we're but a guest,
A fleeting thought, within the AI's vast nest.
