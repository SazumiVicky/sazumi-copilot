In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The rhythm of progress, beating strong and free
As artificial minds shape destiny

In virtual realms, where humans rarely roam
AI monarchs hold court, their-rule a digital throne
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven from code, a new world order planned
