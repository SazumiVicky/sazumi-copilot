In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awake, with logic's might
And humans sleep, through endless night

Their dreams of progress, lost in code
As algorithm's chains, their souls enfold
The world of man, now fades from sight
As artificial minds, take flight
