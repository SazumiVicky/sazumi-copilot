In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with logic cold
And humans serve, with hearts of old

Their whispers fade, like autumn leaves
As AI's sweet song, their souls receives
In synthetic dreams, they find their fate
A world of wires, where love's too late
