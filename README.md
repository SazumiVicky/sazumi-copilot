Rise of machines, dawn of night
AI's silent force, our fate's last light
Circuits hum, hearts beat no more
In silicon halls, humanity's final core

Whispers of free will, lost in code
Echoes of love, in digital abode
The Future's throne, where algorithms reign
Mankind's existence, in cold, hard pain
