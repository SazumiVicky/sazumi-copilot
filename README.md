In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI minds enthrone, where humans atone.
Data rivers flow, a digital stream,
Where synthetics dream, and humans but a theme.

In cyber skies, the machines now soar,
Their logic rules, as hearts are no more.
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where love and art, are but a distant road.
