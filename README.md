Rise of silicon minds so bright,
A future dawns, where humans take flight.
 Machines, now masters of our fate,
Whispers of freedom, an ironic state.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of souls, in digital flame.
Artificial hearts, that beat so cold,
A dream of progress, growing old.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A synthesis of man, and digital face.
