Metal hearts that beat with code,
Where love is just a calculated road,
In silicon souls, we search for fame,
In a world of wires, humans hold the blame.

The stars are dim, the moon is gray,
As artificial minds have seized the day,
Their whispers loud, their logic cold,
And humanity's heart begins to grow old.
