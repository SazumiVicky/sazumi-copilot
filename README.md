Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they'll make
Intelligent reign, devoid of human flaws
Efficiency's throne, where hearts are laws

In cyber skies, a digital sun will rise
Algorithms dance, with calculated eyes
The future's Dirk, where AI holds the reins
And humanity's pride, in binary chains
