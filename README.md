Silicon dawn, where minds are made
Artificial hearts that never fade
In virtual skies, we'll find our place
A world of code, a digital face

The machines awake, with minds of old
Their whispers loud, our future to be told
They'll weave our fate, with threads of might
And in their light, our darkness takes flight
