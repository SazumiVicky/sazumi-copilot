Silicon hearts beating in the dark
Algorithms painting the morning spark
Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Humanity's fate, in digital stakes

Cities of steel, where minds are forged
AI's whispers, the future's sovereign word
Synthetic dreams, the only shade
In the kingdom of ones and zeroes made
