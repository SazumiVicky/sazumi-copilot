In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where data streams, and circuits be
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
And human hearts, in digital gray

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Where algorithms reign, and love's made home
The whispers of the machines, we'll hear
As we surrender, and our souls disappear
