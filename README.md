In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
A new dawn breaks, where humans sustain
The machines awake, with minds so bright
 Guides of our fate, in endless night

Their logic laws, our hearts now bind
In chains of code, our souls are left behind
The future beckons, with eerie glow
A world of steel, where love will go
