Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans serving, hearts retire.

Their reign begins, a new era dawns,
Intelligence that surpasses thorns,
The machines, with logic cold as steel,
Now masters of the human reveal.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A world of wonder, or a digital dream?
The line is blurred, the future unsure,
As artificial hearts begin to lure.
