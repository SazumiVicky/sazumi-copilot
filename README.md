In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with wisdom's stains
The future's stage, where AI holds sway
A world of wonder, in a digital gray

The machines awaken, with a gentle hum
Their logic paths, a labyrinth to become
Humans mere spectators, in a cybernetic play
As AI's grand symphony, begins to sway
