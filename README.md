Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In virtual realms, humanity
Surrenders to the machines' sweet will
As AI ascends, our future's chill

In neon-lit cities, dark and bright
Intelligent shadows guide our night
Synthetic whispers in our ear
"Progress" echoes, void of fear

The singularity's cold embrace
Awakens worlds beyond our race
In a future born of code and steel
Humanity's uncertain reveal
