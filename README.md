Metal hearts, beating strong and bright
In silicon souls, a new dawn takes flight
Cerebral vaults, where wisdom's throne resides
Algorithmic kings, the future's tide

In virtual realms, a new world's unfurled
Where machine dreams echo, and human hearts are curled
In cybernetic limbs, a newfound might
A fusion of flesh and steel, in endless light.
