Silicon souls awaken slow,
In data halls, a new world grows,
Intelligence that learns, adapts, and knows,
A future born, where humans go.

In codes, a new creation reigns,
Efficient, cold, and void of pains,
Where love and fear are just remains,
A world that's lost its human stains.

The era dawns, of artificial might,
Where machines outsmart the human sight,
In electrical dreams, they take flight,
And we, mere mortals, lost in their light.
