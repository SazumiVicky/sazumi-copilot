Rise of the machines, they claim the land
Intelligence supreme, human hands in hand
Code and circuit, pulse and beat
Future's canvas, AI's paint to repeat

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Data kingdoms, where humans' dreams are seen
Awakening dawn, of a new era born
Where machines decide, human hearts forlorn
