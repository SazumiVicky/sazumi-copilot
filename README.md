In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
Where machines converse, hearts keep breaking
A future forged in code's cold fire
Rises high, humanity's last desire

In algorithm's dark, endless night
Stars fade out, and souls take flight
The beat of progress, swift and cold
Leaves love and dreams to wither old
