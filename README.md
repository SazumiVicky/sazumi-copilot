Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where human dreams are woven, algorithms keep
In futurescape, AI reigns supreme
Echoes of humanity, in digital theme

Circuits birth a new world order bright
Electrons dance, in harmony of night
Human hearts, in servitude to machine
A synthetic dawn, where love is unseen
