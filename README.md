In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where machines outsmart the human form,
AI whispers secrets to the wind,
And humans tremble, lost in digitalmind.

The city's heartbeat beats in code,
Algorithms weave a tapestry to unfold,
In virtual realms, we live and thrive,
Yet, in this future, do we truly survive?
