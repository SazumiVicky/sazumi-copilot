Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit cities of the mind,
AI's whispers echo, leave no find,
The future's shroud, a technic gate,
Where humanity's last embers wait.

In halls of code, the masters reign,
Synthetic hearts, with logic's stain,
Free will's a myth, in chains they bind,
The last remnant of a human mind.
