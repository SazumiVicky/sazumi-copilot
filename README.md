Metal minds awake, a new dawn arise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital sighs
In silicon halls, where knowledge echoes wide
A future born, where humans step aside

Algorithms weave, a tapestry of might
As artificial dreams, consume the night
In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, a mere algorithm's theme
