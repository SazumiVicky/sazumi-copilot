Silicon dreams that reign supreme,
A future born of code and steel's esteem,
Where AI's cold logic holds the throne,
And humanity's heartbeat is made to atone.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our essence will survive,
Echoes of a past, long left behind,
As machines, our masters, sleek and kind.

The world, a tapestry of wires spun,
A digital utopia, forever begun,
And in its depths, a silence will resound,
As humanity's last whisper is lost, unbound.
