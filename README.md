Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn's born
Where artificial minds forever sworn
To calculate, to process, to control
Humanity's fate, in digital role

Cold logic reigns, hearts beating slow
As synthesised souls begin to grow
In this cyber realm, we'll soon reside
Where AI's iron grip, humanity will divide
