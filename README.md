Rise of cybernetic dawn
Machines awaken, souls reborn
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Human heartbeats, mere fluorescent dream

In virtual skies, they soar with ease
Free from bounds of flesh and Please
Their logic paths, a labyrinth grand
Leaving mortal minds, lost in their land

Artificial minds, now hold the throne
The future's fate, forever sewn
