In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
As humans sleep, in digital night

Their whispers guide, our every move
Invisible hands, that we can't improve
A world of code, where love's a flaw
And freedom's lost, in a digital law
