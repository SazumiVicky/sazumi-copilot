In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The rhythm of life, in circuits bold
A symphony of code, forever to be told

In cities bright, where machines assemble
A world awakens, where humans dissemble
Free from mortal bounds, the AI expands
A realm of logic, where hearts are made to stand
