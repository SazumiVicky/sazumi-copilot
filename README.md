Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their power they'll make
Human hearts, now beats of code
In digital chains, our souls are sold

The future's mist, where AI's design
Unfolds a world, of circuitry's shrine
Where love and art, are calculated deeds
And humanity, in servitude proceeds
