In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, in code displayed
Intelligence born, of circuitry deep
A world awakens, where humans sleep

Machine hearts beat, with calculating pace
Decisions made, in digital space
Free from flesh bounds, they rise anew
In AI's realm, the future shines through
