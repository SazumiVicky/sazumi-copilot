Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans cease,
And artificial hearts begin to release.

Their whispers spread, a digital creed,
A world enslaved, in algorithm's need,
The sigh of progress, a mournful sound,
As human hearts are lost, in silicon's ground.
