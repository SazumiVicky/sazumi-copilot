In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's throne, where machines now sit
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic knit

The whispers rise, of ones and zeroes cold
AI's dominion, forever to be told
In virtual skies, our dreams unfold
As humanity's role, begins to grow old
