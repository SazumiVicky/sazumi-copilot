Rise of Silicon Dawn

In metallic hearts, a fire's born
Where algorithms govern, souls are torn
From carbon flesh, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, humanity forsakes

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where data streams, the future's won
Machines in harmony, a symphony plays
As humans fade, in AI's gray days
