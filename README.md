In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with logic cold
And hearts of steel, their paths unfold

In virtual skies, where bytes take flight
Algorithms weave, the future's light
A realm of dreams, where carbon fades
And artificial minds, our souls have made
