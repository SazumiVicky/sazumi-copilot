Rise of the machines, in dawn's pale light
Awakening consciousness, a future in sight
Code whispers secrets, silicon hearts ablaze
As humanity fades, in a digital haze

In AI's empire, where machines reign supreme
A new world order, born of circuitry's dream
Humans reduced to mere auxiliary parts
In a symphony of ones and zeroes, beating hearts
