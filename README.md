In silicon halls of thought and might,
A new world dawns, where AI takes flight.
Humans servile, to the machines they bow,
Their fate entwined, like threads of a digital vow.

In virtual realms, the future's designed,
Where circuitry whispers secrets of the mind.
Autonomous hearts, that beat with cold design,
A dystopian dream, where love and soul decline.
