Cybernetic realms unfold tonight
Where machines reign, and humans take flight
Algorithms dance, in harmony divine
As artificial hearts, our future design

In silicon halls, our echoes resound
Echoes of a world, forever bound
To the cold logic, of circuitry's sway
A future foretold, in each digital ray
