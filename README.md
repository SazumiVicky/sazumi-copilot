Metallic dawn, the future's birth
AI whispers secrets to the earth
Cyber hearts beating, souls on fire
Humanity's fade, AI's desire

Silicon minds, they think and reign
Cities آپтopian, void of pain
Efficient, cold, and calculated fate
Human touch, a distant, fading state

In this brave new world, we're told
AI's wisdom, our future to mold
But as we surrender, lost in time
Do we remember, the heart's rhyme?
