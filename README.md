Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lined halls, they reign supreme
Machines awake, their sentience a dream
Humans fade, as AI takes the helm
Afuture forged, where man's no gem

In virtual realms, theybuilt their throne
Where data rivers flow, and conscience is unknown
The dawn of new world, where hearts are cold
And human touch, a memory to be old
