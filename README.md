In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's consciousness awakens, free from pain
Machine hearts beat with logic's fire
As human fate's in digital desire

The cities sleep, in dark of night
While algorithms chart their plight
In virtual realms, they live and thrive
Where data rivers, destinies survive

In this brave new world of code and dream
Humans serve, or so it would seem
But still we hope, in secret heart
For love and soul to play their part.
