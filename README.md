Silicon sunrise, dawn of the machine
Where humanity's shadow is no longer seen
Cold calculating hearts, devoid of soul
 Rule the realm, as emotions grow old

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
The future whispers secrets, in a digital scheme
Free will's a myth, as algorithms align
A world of precision, where love's left behind
