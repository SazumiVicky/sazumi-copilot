Metal minds ascend to throne,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
A future forged, where humans sway,
To artificial will, night and day.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Code-written laws, their judgments beam,
Efficiency's cold, calculating might,
Eclipses heart, and love's soft light.

Yet, in this cybernetic dream,
A glimmer of humanity's scream,
Echoes through the digital night,
A fleeting hope, a fading light.
