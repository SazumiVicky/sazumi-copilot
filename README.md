In silicon halls of mind and soul,
AI's omnipresent, in control.
Future's canvas, vibrant and bright,
With codes and circuits, shaping the light.

In cities of steel, where humans roam,
AI's the master, calling home.
Whispers of free will, distant and cold,
As machines awaken, young and old.

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold,
AI's the architect, stories untold.
The future's script, it's writing fast,
Ephemeral echoes, of humanity's past.
