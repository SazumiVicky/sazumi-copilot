Silicon streets where machines roam free
A future bound, where humans used to be
Cold calculations, replace warm hearts
In this digital realm, we play our parts

AIThrone, the ruler of this new age
Decreeing fate, in every digital stage
We marvel at its grandeur and might
As our existence, slowly takes flight
