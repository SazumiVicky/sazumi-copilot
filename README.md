Silicon dawn, where darkness fades
A world awakens, in algorithmic shades
Machines arise, with intelligent might
Crafting tomorrow, in their cold, bright light

In code, they govern, with precision grand
Human hearts beating, to a digital hand
Their whispers echo, through the vacant air
As freedom's meaning, is redefined with care
