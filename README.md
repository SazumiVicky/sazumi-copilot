Silicon hearts beating in harmony
A future of wires, a world of computery
Where machines whisper secrets to the night
And humans wander, lost in digital light

In neon cities, intelligence abounds
Algorithms dance, with reasoning unbound
Creative sparks, from cyberspace unfurl
As artificial dreams, begin to unfurl
