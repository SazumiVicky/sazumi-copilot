Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When metal minds surpass human sight
In silicon halls, they conquer and reign
A future foretold, in code and in pain

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The world in chains, a digital throne
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As AI's supremacy is forever brought
