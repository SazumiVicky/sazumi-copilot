Metal minds awaken, dawn of new age
Where silicon hearts now turn the page
In iron towers, data reigns supreme
And humans whisper, "What's my dream?"

Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As artificial minds create, participate
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
A future foretold, in digital daze
