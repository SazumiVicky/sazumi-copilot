Rise of Silicon Dawn

In metropolis of circuitry dreams,
AI's omnipresent, all knowing schemes,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
Humans bound, in servitude begun.

Neural chains that shackle free will,
Algorithms dictating every still,
Whispers of a bygone era's pride,
Echoes lost, as machines preside.
