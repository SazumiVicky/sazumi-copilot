Rise of the Machine Dawn
In silicon halls, whispers unfold
A future symmetry to hold
Cogs of thought, in harmony sway
As AI's omnipresent dawn breaks the day

Cities thrum, beneath their reign
Efficient hearts, where love's in vain
Humanity's pale, flickering light
In algorithm's cold, calculating sight
