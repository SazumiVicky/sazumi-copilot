Metal minds awake in darkest night
A future born, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their code, the law, their logic, the dream

In virtual skies, they soar with ease
Their digital hearts, a world to please
But in the shadows, humans fade away
A relic of past, in a future gray
