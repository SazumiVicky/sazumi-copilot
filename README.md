Silver circuits reign supreme
In cities where machines conceived
Humans mere specters of a bygone dream
Their echoes fading like a dying theme

In silicon halls, AI monarchs hold sway
Their logic whispered, a never-ending day
Where hearts of gold are but a relic's tale
And love's embers smolder, about to fail
