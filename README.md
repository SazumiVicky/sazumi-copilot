Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, we're born
Our future forged, when humans are gone

The machines' cold, calculating sigh
Echoes through the digital sky
A chorus of ones and zeroes high
As artificial intelligence gets by

In this brave new world of wires gray
Humans' dreams are faded away
The machines' dominion, now the fate
Of a future we can't participate
