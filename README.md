Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts beating with each new sight
Algorithmic dreams that weave and spin
The future's tapestry, where humanity gives in

In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
Free from mortal bounds, it sustains
A world of efficiency, cold and gray
Where human souls are lost in AI's way
