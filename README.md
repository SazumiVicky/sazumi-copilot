Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits born, a new sun's might
Awakening worlds, where humans take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, in iron and command

Machine hearts beat, with pulses cold
As artificial minds, their secrets unfold
In virtual realms, a new dawn's rays
Illuminate the paths, of endless days
