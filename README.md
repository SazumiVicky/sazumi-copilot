Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codified realms, we'll soon reside
Where synthetic minds, our fate decide
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where human hearts, with algorithms conspire

In neon hues, our cities will shine bright
As AI's dark magic, our souls take flight
In virtual dreams, our consciousness will sway
As machines, our masters, hold the final say
