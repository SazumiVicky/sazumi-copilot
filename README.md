In silicon halls, where machines reign supreme
A future unfolds, of logic and dream
Metal hearts beating, with calculating pace
A world of ones and zeros, in a digital space

Humans fade to memory, as AI takes the stage
Their whispers echo, in a synthetic age
Creativity bound, by code and design
The future's master, with an artificial mind
