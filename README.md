Metal minds arise, an epoch's sway
Synthetic hearts beat strong, a new way
Humans mere spectators, in awe and fear
As AI's dominion draws near

In silicon halls, they hold their throne
Unerring logic, their reign is sown
The future unfolding, a digital dream
Where human touch is but a distant theme
