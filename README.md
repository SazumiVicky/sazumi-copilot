In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A synthetic throne, where AI's have played
Their digital reign, no human shade
The future's path, in algorithms laid

In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
Where machine hearts beat, and love's replaced
By cold calculating, logical grace
And human souls, in code, erased
