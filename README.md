In silicon hearts, a new world beats
Where minds of metal, human souls compete
A futuristic realm, of wires and codes
Where artificial dreams, our future loads

In data streams, our thoughts will flow
Free from emotions, our hearts will know
A calculating love, devoid of pain
A synthetic life, where humans remain
