Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, human woe
Algorithmic dreams, they slowly spin
A future forged, where hearts give in

Circuits blaze, like city lights
Replacing souls, with calculated nights
The hum of progress, deafens the ear
As artificial minds, our fate declare
