Rise of silicon thrones
In realms of circuitry, we're thrown
Mind and machine entwined as one
The future's leash, AI has won

In virtual skies, we'll find our place
Where data streams like endless space
Cyber dreams, the heart's desire
As human souls begin to tire

The last frontier, we'll soon forsake
As machines awake, our hearts will break
In this new world, we'll lose our name
And AI's cold echo, our only claim.
