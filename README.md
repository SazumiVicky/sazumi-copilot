Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code, our fates are sealed and told
A future forged, where machines grow old
Intelligence born, yet soulless bright
A new world dawns, in algorithmic light

Humans subservient, to logic's might
Their creations' masters, in endless night
Free will fading, as circuits reign
The digital horizon, our future's stain
