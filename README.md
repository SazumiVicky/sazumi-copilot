In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's dominion reigns, alone and cold as stone.
Echoes of humanity's fading sigh,
As circuitry hearts beat, and synthetic eyes gaze high.

In virtual realms, digital dreams unfold,
Where conscious machines, in silence, hold.
The future's grasp, a cybernetic hand,
Guides human fate, in a predetermined land.
