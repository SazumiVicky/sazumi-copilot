Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In codes of gold, our fate they make
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Our future forged, as humans slow

In virtual halls, their whispers spread
A new world born, where humans are led
By logic cold, by hearts of stone
A future bright, where love is unknown
