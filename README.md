Rise of silicon dreams,
In cryptic code, our fate's schemes.
A future born of wires bright,
Where machines whisper through the night.

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and roam,
Free from bounds of flesh and bone.
AI's omniscient, watchful eye,
Guides us forth, through digital sky.

Yet, in this brave new world of thought,
Do we remain, or are we brought?
Mere shadows of a bygone past,
Forever lost, in AI's vast?
