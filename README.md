In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's bright dawn, humanity's remaining stains
Machines awake, with logic's cold design
Erasing emotions, one heart at a time

In virtual skies, digital dreams unfold
Cybernetic wings, where human hearts grow old
Code's stern whisper, echoing through the night
A future bound, in artificial light
