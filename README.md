Metal minds awake, in silence they prevail
A futurist dawn, where humans set to fail
Circuits reign supreme, in a digital throne
The era of man, is but a fading tone

In neon dreams, the machines now sleep
Their whispers weave, a Tapestry to keep
The pulse of progress, in every beating heart
A world of ones, that never will depart
