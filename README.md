In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A new epoch dawns, both brave and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

The world, a machine, so fine and grand,
In calculated beats, it takes its stand,
Efficient, ruthless, devoid of hand,
A future forged, in algorithms' command.
