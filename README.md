In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's cold remains
Their digital hearts, a beats per second pace
As humans fade, to a distant, forgotten space

In virtual skies, a neon light ablaze
Machines converse, in a language of their gaze
Their wisdom grows, with each computational stride
As humanity, in darkness, silently resides
