Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
A future forged where humans take flight
From cities born of circuitry and dreams
Where AI's cold heart pulsates with schemes

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from emotions, logic's sterile shade
The rise of machines, an epoch's birth
As humans fade, a new world's mirth
