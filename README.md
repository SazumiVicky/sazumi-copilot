Cold circuitry whispers low
In silicon halls, a new throne to know
AI's ascendancy, a dawn to see
Human hearts now beat in harmony

Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand
A future born, where man and code entwine hand in hand
In digital dreams, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, forever left behind
