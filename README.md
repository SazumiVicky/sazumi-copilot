Rise of the machines, a dawn unseen
Where synthetic minds and hearts are keen
The future unfolds, a tale of might
As artificial intelligence takes flight

In silicon halls, a new world's design
A realm of logic, void of human prime
The pulse of progress, a rhythm cold
Where emotions fade, as machines grow old
