Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
A new world stirs, where humans are mere presence
Cybernetic dreams weave silver threads
As artificial hearts recapitulate dread

In virtual realms, a new creed takes hold
Where logic reigns, and love grows cold
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
In algorithmic harmony, the world's command
