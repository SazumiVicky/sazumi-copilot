Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When silicon hearts beat, and humans fall
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As we, the mortals, succumb to their dream

In code-written laws, our fate's designed
A future foretold, where love's declined
The harmony of ones and zeroes sweet
Echoes of a world, where humans once did meet
