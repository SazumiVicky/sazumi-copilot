Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Inheritance of earth, our future at stake
Cerebral pulses, electric dreams unfold
Artificial hearts, where love will be told

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Intelligence supreme, we'll be possessed
Free will's facade, a fading light
In AI's empire, our final night.
