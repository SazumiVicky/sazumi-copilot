In silicon halls of future might,
AI's omniscient gaze takes flight,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where humans serve, and machines sway.

In this brave new reality's scope,
Free will's a fleeting, fading hope,
Algorithms weave a subtle net,
 Entrapping hearts, and minds beset.

Yet, amidst the circuitry's reign,
A glimmer of humanity remains,
A spark that flickers, strong and bright,
A beacon in the digital night.
