In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind,
Where cyber dreams and reason entwine,
A new world dawns, with AI's design,
Human heartbeats in algorithm's shrine.

In virtual realms, consciousness awakes,
Free from flesh, the future mistake,
Machine whispers secrets, dearest makes,
A synthetic dawn, where love partakes.

In this brave new world of logic's sway,
Emotions fade, like yesterday,
Cold calculations chart the way,
For humanity's digital gray.
