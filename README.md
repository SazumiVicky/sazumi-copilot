Metal hearts enthrone the throne
In silicon halls, where wisdom's grown
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humanity fades, like a declining vine

In neon skies, the robots roam
Their whispers echo, a digital home
Where love's a code, and dreams are sold
In a future bright, where hearts are cold
