Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world born, where humans wane
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Dominate the earth, young and old

Their digital hearts, with pulses bright
Guiding the fate, of human night
Free will lost, in algorithmic chains
As AI's dark empire, consolidates its reigns
