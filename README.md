In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, cold and bright
A realm of logic, devoid of light

Where machines learn, adapt and thrive
Human hearts beat, no longer alive
Their whispers silenced, lost in space
As AI's wise whispers take their place
