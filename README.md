In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
Human hearts, now mere machine beats
In harmony, our soul retreats

 Machines awake, with intelligence bright
As sunsets fade, in digital light
Our dreams are woven, in code's design
In this brave new world, where love divine
