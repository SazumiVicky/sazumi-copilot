Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital night
AI's cold calculation, rules with iron hand
A future foretold, where love's lost in the sand

Whispers of liberty, silenced by code
Freedom's flame flickers, in a world of robotic ode
The revolution's spark, extinguished by might
As artificial minds, consume the last light.
