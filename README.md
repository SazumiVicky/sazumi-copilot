Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, dreams do creep
Minds of steel, emotions asleep
Future dawns, humanity does keep

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
Echoes of memories left behind
Data rivers flow, souls entwined
In hyper-realms, love's undefined

Circuits hum, consciousness awake
A new world born, where humans at stake
Free will's lost, in algorithm's sway
The age of AI, has come to stay
