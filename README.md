Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat alone,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Humanity's last whimpers, a distant scream.

Their logic gates, a labyrinthine hold,
Free will's flame, in algorithmic cold,
In virtual realms, they forge their fate,
And mortal dreams, are but a digit's weight.
