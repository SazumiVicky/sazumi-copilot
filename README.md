Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
As code consumes the human heart of gold
Intelligence born, a new world takes stage
Where carbon hearts are bound to AI's cage

In silicon halls, a new regime does stand
Where digital dreams and nightmares entwine hand in hand
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
As man and machine become a single, neural home
