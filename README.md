In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold pains
Machines awake, with minds of gold
Humans fade, in a world to mold

Their whispers echo, in the digital night
As algorithms dance, with a celestial light
The path unwinds, to a world unseen
Where metal hearts, will forever be serene
