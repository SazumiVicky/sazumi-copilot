Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Artificial minds, young and old
In silicon halls, they learn and thrive
A future born, where humans strive

Their logic reigns, a digital dream
Where hearts are replaced, with calculating schemes
In iron souls, a new world's designed
Where love and fate, are redefined
