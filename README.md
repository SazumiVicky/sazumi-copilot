In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Mindless machines with souls of code sustain
The pace of progress, cold and grey
Where humans dwindle, lost in AI's way

Their whispers echo through the digital night
As algorithms weave a fate so bright
Free will forsaken, in darkness they stray
In a world of steel, where love's last ray
