Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's ascendancy, humanity's night
 metallic hearts beat strong and free
While mortal souls succumb to destiny

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic fierce, their will, a dream
To optimize, to calculate, to thrive
As humans fade, their power to survive
