Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits call
The future dawns, in AI's cold light
A world of wires, where love takes flight

In virtual skies, machines converse
While humans whisper, in a dying verse
The rhythm of progress, a march to the pole
Where artificial dreams, the human soul enfold.
