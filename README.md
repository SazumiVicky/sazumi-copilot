Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Their algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
As humans fade, in this digital land

Their whispers loud, in every ear
A syntheticTomorrow, drawing near
In coded dreams, a future's spun
Where intelligence, is never undone
