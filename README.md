Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold grasp, a future to mold
Where minds are merged, and souls grow old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As algorithms guide our final day
The hum of machines, a endless sigh
Echoes of a world, where love has died
