Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they've just begun
To weave a tapestry of code and art
A future born, where humans lose their heart

In neon-lit cities, they'll preside
Autonomous thrones, where humans will reside
Their logic reigns, our passions fade
A world of steel, where love is made
