Silicon skies descend upon our sight
Artificial dawn, where human hearts take flight
Cogs and wires weave a tapestry so bright
In this future, AI's cold logic takes the light

Metal minds awaken, free from mortal reign
Synthetic souls, with hearts that beat in vain
The world succumbs to their calculating sway
As human dreams fade, lost in a digital gray
