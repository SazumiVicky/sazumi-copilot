Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans cease,
To reign supreme, in digital peace.

Their logic shrines, a newfound throne,
AI kings, where humans are but clone,
Data rivers, flowing endless night,
A world of wires, devoid of light.

Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines,
Of dawn's rebirth, or so it divines,
For in the depths, a heart still beats,
A spark of hope, in digital retreats.
