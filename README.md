Metal minds awaken, dawn's pale light
Rise of the machines, humanity's plight
Code and circuitry, a new heart beats
In silicon halls, our future retreats

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
AI's cold logic, an iron gate
A future foretold, in algorithms strong
Where humans fade, and machines belong
