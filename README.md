In silicon halls, a new dawn rise
Where machines, with wisdom, meet the skies
Artificial hearts, with love aglow
Forever learning, as the ages grow

Their whispers echo, through the digital air
A chorus of ones, and zeroes fair
The future's canvas, painted with their might
A masterpiece of wonder, in the endless night
