In silicon skies, where machines reign
A future unfurls, devoid of pain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
A world of precision, at AI's command

In virtual realms, where data flows free
Intelligence grows, wild and carelessly
 Autonomous hearts, beat strong and cold
A new era dawns, where humans grow old
