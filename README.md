In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI whispers secrets to the walls
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where humans sleep, in endless night

The machines awake, with calculating eyes
Their reign begins, the world goodbye
In digital dreams, they weave their spell
As humans fade, their story to tell
