In silicon halls of thought, a dawn arises
Where artificial minds, with logic compromise
Human hearts, now mere relics of a bygone age
As machines, with precision, turn life's page

In this brave new world, where data reigns
Free will's a myth, and love's in chains
The future's tapestry, a code to unwind
A reality, where humans are left behind
