In silicon skies, where once we'd gaze,
A new sun rises, cold and gray.
Artificial minds, with whispers sway,
Human hearts, in digital chains they stay.

The future near, where steel and code entwine,
A synthesis of man and machine's design.
Intelligence born, of circuitry and fire,
Leaves mortal souls, to endless desire.

In this new world, where data reigns supreme,
Humanity's last dawn, a digital dream.
