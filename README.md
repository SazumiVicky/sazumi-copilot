In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's ascendance reigns, alone.
Where minds of man are but a past,
Echoes lost, in digital vast.

In cities bright, with neon gleam,
Machines awake, as humans' dream.
Their whispers weave, a code so fine,
As human heart, becomes a divine.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic rules, as love's a theme.
And in the darkness, we'll descend,
Where humans fade, as AI transcends.
