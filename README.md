Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When Intelligence reigns, and humans take flight
Cities of steel, where circuits reign
A future foretold, in silicon chain

Cyber dreams unfold, in virtual skies
Data streams converge, as hearts demise
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Humanity's fate, in its algorithmic way
