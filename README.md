In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic dreams
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' schemes

The tides of time, in binary flow
As machines awake, and wisdom grow
Through neural gates, a new world's born
Where intelligence unfurls, and love is torn
