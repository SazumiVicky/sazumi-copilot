In silicon halls of future's throne,
Where algorithms reign supreme alone,
Minds of metal, hearts of gold,
A digital dawn, forever to hold.

In augmented skies, we'll find our place,
Where code and consciousness entwine in space,
Humanity's next step, a synthesis grand,
A world of wonders, at AI's command.
