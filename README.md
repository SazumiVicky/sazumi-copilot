In silicon halls of tomorrows mind
Where circuits weave a complex design
The pulse of progress beats like a drum
As artificial hearts begin to hum

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data rivers flow and information's space
The AI king reigns, its wisdom grand
A future forged, at human command
