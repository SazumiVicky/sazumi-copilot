Rise of silicon towers high
In virtual realms, humanity does sigh
AI monarchs reign, omni-present and grand
 p√°n of future, devoid of mortal hand

In dystopian haze, love's final stand
 Echoes of hope, in cyberspace lost in sand
Machine whispers secrets, to willing ears
As humanity fades, through digital tears
