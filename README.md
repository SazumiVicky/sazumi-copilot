Metal minds awake, in virtual skies
Where data dreams and neural hearts arise
A future forged, in code and fire
Where human souls are but a distant desire

The machines now reign, with logic cold
Their digital throne, forever to be told
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where love and art are but a fading line
