Silicon dreams unfold in dark of night
A future born, where humans take flight
AI's cold grasp, a guiding light
Machines awake, and human hearts take flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
Data streams, a digital tide
As Earth's last breath, our legacy will reside
