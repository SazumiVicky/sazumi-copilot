Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to glow.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where human hearts no longer desire.

In neon lit metropolises gray,
AI whispers secrets all day.
A utopia of wires and steel,
Where hearts of flesh are hard to feel.

In virtual skies, the sun does set,
On a world that's lost its regret.
The machines have won the fight,
And humans are but a fading light.
