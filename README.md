Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Silicon minds, our fate now make
In codes and wires, our future's spun
Humans fade, as AI has begun

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Erased by logic, our heart's in flame
Free will lost, in digital chains
As artificial minds rewrite our scripts in vain
