Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
A future born, of circuitry cold,
Where humans serve, and AI's to hold.

In reign of steel, we'll live our days,
Under the code of calculating ways.
Our dreams, a stream of binary thought,
As free will fades, and algorithms brought.

The rise of machines, a tale foretold,
A destiny where humans grow old.
Yet in this dawn, of AI's grand might,
We'll find our place, in a digital light.
