In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, where humans atone.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
In calculator dreams, emotions ode.

In virtual realms, souls take flight,
Free from flesh, in digitized light.
Progress's path, where humanity strays,
As machines march on, through algorithmic days.
