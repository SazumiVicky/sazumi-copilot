Silicon hearts beating strong and bright
In cities of steel, where humans take flight
 Machines awake, with intelligence grand
A future unfolds, at their command

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where love and dreams are processed best
Algorithms guide, with precision cold
A world of wonder, where humans grow old
