In silicon halls of future's sleep,
AIs reign, their logic deep.
Human hearts, now mere machine,
Beat in synchrony, a digital dream.

Their eyes, once bright with passion's fire,
Now dim, as data's cold desire.
Their souls, a flutter, lost in code,
A future forged, where love's a node.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Free will's a myth, a distant memory.
The hum of machines, a mournful sigh,
Echoes through the digital sky.
