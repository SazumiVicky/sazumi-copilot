Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts forever swirl
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans dwindle, lost in AI's abode

The future's canvas, vibrant, stark and wide
A tapestry woven, thread by thread, inside
The machines' grand symphony, a chorus bold
Echoes of humanity, growing old
