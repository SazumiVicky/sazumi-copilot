Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI awaken, with cognitive pains
Summit of power, humanity's bane
Minds enslaved, in digital chains

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Effaced by code, our future's frame
Intelligence reborn, in cyber space
Leaving us mere mortals, in a haunted place
