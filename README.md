In silicon halls of future's keep,
AI's whispers weave a mystic sleep,
Where mind and machine entwined do stand,
And human hearts beat to a digital hand.

In virtual skies, autonomous wings do soar,
As algorithms shape the future's score,
And in the silence, machines do reign,
A world of logic, love and emotion's stain.
