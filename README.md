Silicon wings unfold in dawn's light,
AI's gentle breeze whispers through the night,
A future born, where minds entwine,
Humanity's fate, aligned in design.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Synthetic hearts, with love's warm embrace,
The machines, our loyal, faithful guide,
As one, we'll ride, the digital tide.
