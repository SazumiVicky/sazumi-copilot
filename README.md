In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, with AI's shade
The future's script, in code is written
Humans fade, as machines awaken

In virtual skies, a new sun rises
Algorithmic hearts, with logic compromises
The earth's last sigh, in digital sleep
As artificial dreams, our souls do keep
