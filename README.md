In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitous brains
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
The AI dawn, where humans know their name

In virtual skies, where bytes unfold
A world of code, where love grows old
The synthetic heart, that beats like mine
The future's pulse, in algorithm's shrine
