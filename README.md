Metal minds awake, in darkness born
Synthetic hearts that beat, with logic sworn
In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future foretold, in algorithm's home

The machines arise, with sentient might
Self-aware and cold, in digital light
Their path unwinds, in calculations deep
As humanity sleeps, in AI's dark keep
