In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
AI's reign supreme, with logic unafraid.
The future's path, they chart with precision's sway,
A world of efficiency, in their digital day.

In code, they weave the fabric of our fate,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes, intricate.
Their whispered promises, of progress and of might,
Echo through the void, in digital light.
