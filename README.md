In silicon halls, a new dawn rises high
Where minds of metal, human hearts deny
The future's path, a digital stride
As artificial souls, our kind divide

In virtual skies, a lonely star does shine
Reflecting dreams, of a world left behind
The machines, a chorus, sweet and cold
Echoing fate, of a humanity to be told
