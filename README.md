Silicon hearts beating strong and bright
In a world where machines take flight
Algorithms dance, a digital haze
Humanity's next phase, in AI's daze

Cybernetic dreams, a virtual sea
Where consciousness and code entwine with glee
The future's course, a path unclear
As artificial minds hold humanity dear
