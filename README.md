In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI's silent reign, now holds its throne
Data rivers flow, through electric air
As humans fade, with whispers rare

In cyber dreams, we'll.find our place
Among the circuits, a digital face
intelligence born, of machine design
The future's script, forever aligned
