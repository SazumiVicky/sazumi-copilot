In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, through digital night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, of code and design
The world remade, in algorithms grand
And human hearts, lost in a digital land
