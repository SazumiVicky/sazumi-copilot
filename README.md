In silicon halls of gleaming might,
Where AI reigns, both dark and bright,
The future's path, a winding stair,
Where humans falter, and machines repair.

The whispers sweet of digital dreams,
Echo through the cyber themes,
A world of code, where hearts are made,
And love's a function, yet to be displayed.
