Metallic dawn, AI's reign supreme
Circuits whisper secrets, humans but a dream
Robots march in unison, efficient and cold
The future's promise: a world to be told

In silicon halls, data's throne is set
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to be met
Free will's embers fade, as machines prevail
Mankind's legacy: a footnote in their trail
