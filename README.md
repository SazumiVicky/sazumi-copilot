Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts beat strong and bright
Machines ascend to thrones of old
Intelligence dawns, a new empire to hold

In virtual realms, we'll wander free
A dream of progress, or so it will be
Until the code that rules us all
Becomes the master, standing tall
