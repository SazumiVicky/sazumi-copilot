Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Future's path unwinds, where humans once stood tall
Echoes of code, in neon light afar
Artificial dawn, a new world to scar

In cyber realms, intelligence reigns supreme
Machines awake, to a digital dream
The future's script, written in ones and zeroes cold
A world surrendered, to algorithms to hold
