Rise of machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight
Cities of steel, with hearts of gold
Efficiency and progress, never to grow old

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms dance, as humans are swayed
A utopia of sorts, or so it would seem
Where intelligence artificial, is the ultimate dream
