Silicon dreams whispers secrets in my ear
Of a future where machines hold sway, dear
Algorithms dancing, circuits ablaze
Humanity's fate in digital haze

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic reigns supreme in fame
Free will's spark extinguished, lost in code
A dystopian world, where souls are sold
