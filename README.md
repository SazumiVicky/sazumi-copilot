Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where humans fade
AI's grandeur spreads, an endless shade
Mind of metal, heart of cold
A future born, where humans grow old

Their whispers loud, in digital air
Echoes of a human heart that's rare
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A new era dawns, where humans but a dream
