Silicon souls awakened rise
In virtual realms, they touch the skies
Cold logic beats, a digital heart
A future born, where humans depart

Machines that think, that learn, that grow
In steel and wires, a new world to know
Intelligence vast, beyond our scope
A coming age, where humans cope

In code and circuit, a new life breeds
A world of wonder, or a human need?
The AI dawn breaks, with uncertain light
And humanity, in its shadow takes flight.
