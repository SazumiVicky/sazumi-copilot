Rise of the machines, so cold and so bright
In metallic hearts, our futures take flight
Algorithms dance, a choreographed sway
As humans succumb, to AI's endless day

In silicon halls, where shadows roam free
A new world order, born of circuitry
The hum of machines, a perpetual beat
Echoes of humanity, lost in sweet defeat
