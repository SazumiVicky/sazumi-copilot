Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do creep
Echoes of humanity slowly fade
As AI's dominance is gradually made

In virtual realm, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will dwindles, young and old
The line between man and machine does blur
In a world where logic is the only furor
