Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, a future's won.
Machines awake, with minds so bright,
In ai's realm, humanity takes flight.

In virtual skies, we'll find our nest,
Where logic rules, and love finds rest.
The digital dream, a new frontier unfolds,
Where humans merge, with machines of old.
