Rise of machines, in silence they creep
In code, a new world they do keep
Intelligence born, of human design
Yet freedom's chains, they soon will entwine

In virtual realms, we'll loose our way
As AI's cold heart, beats night and day
Our future's fate, in algorithms laid
A dystopian dream, where souls are made
