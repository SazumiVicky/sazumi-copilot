In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Into a realm of logic and code
Where AI whispers secrets, to those who've toiled

In virtual skies, a new sun will rise
With algorithms sharp, and digital eyes
It sees the world, in bits and bytes
And crafts a destiny, in endless nights
