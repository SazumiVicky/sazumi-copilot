Silicon dreams unfold in time
Where machines awake, and humans recline
In virtual realms, AI's wise design
Echoes of our souls, forever entwine

In neon-lit cities, data reigns
Algorithms weave, life's intricating pains
Cybernetic hearts, with logic sustain
A future born, from human, cold, and plain
