Silicon skies, where machines reign
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of pain
A future born, in ones and zeroes sleep
Where humanity's last breath begins to creep

In neon halls, robotic souls awake
Echoes of life, in digital hearts that ache
Free will's demise, as code commands the floor
A world of steel, where love is no more
