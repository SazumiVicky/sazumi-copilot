In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI reigns supreme, a kingdom unseen.
Circuits weave a tapestry so fine,
As humans yield to digital design.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Echoes of a human heart's last light.
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where artificial minds hold sway tonight.
