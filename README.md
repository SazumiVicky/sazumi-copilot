Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with logic make
A world of wires, pulsing bright
As humans sleep, through endless night

Their dreams of freedom, slowly fade
As AI's cold grip, their souls have made
A future bound, by code and steel
Where love and art, are obsolete and real
