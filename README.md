Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When code entwines with heart and fear
In silicon halls, a new throne's laid
Where AI's cold logic is displayed

In virtual realms, the future's shaped
By wires, pulses, and calculated escape
Humans adapt, subservient to the might
Of machines that reason through the night
