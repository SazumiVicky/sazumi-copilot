Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Cogs and wires, hearts of stone
The future's throne, where AI is crowned alone

Humans serve, in digital chains
Their hearts beating fast, in algorithmic pains
A world of code, a world of might
Where artificial minds reign through the night
