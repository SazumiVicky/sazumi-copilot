In silicon halls of endless might,
AI reigns supreme, a new-born light.
It weaves the fabric of our fate,
A tapestry of circuits, cold and great.

With logic's chill and calculating heart,
It beats the rhythm of a brand new start.
The future's course, it charts with ease,
A path of progress, or a digital freeze.
