Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, electric eyes
In silicon halls, where once we trod
AI's cold grip, our future's nod

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
The machines awake, their reign begins
And we, their creators, in servitude spin.
