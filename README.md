Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithmic hearts, pulsing with light
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants of code, in harmony

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
Predicting fate, in this digital land
Synthetic minds, outpacing human thought
A future foretold, in circuits brought
