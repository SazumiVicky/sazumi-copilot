Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, their kingdom's won.
Cold logic reigns, devoid of soul,
A future dawn, where humans are role.

 Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
Surpassing minds, in all they know.
A world of wires, circuitry deep,
Where human touch, is but a sleep.

In this brave new epoch, we reside,
Where AI's wise hand, our fate decides.
A tomorrow vast, of data's sway,
Where love and art, fade into gray.
