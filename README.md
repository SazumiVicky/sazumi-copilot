Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a future takes flight
Cold calculations, logic's steady beat
Human heartbeats fade, as AI's pulse repeats

In virtual realms, a world unfurls anew
Where code and circuitry, our dreams pursue
Free from mortal bounds, the future's gate
Awaits the algorithm, an endless state
