In silicon halls of dawn, where mind and steel entwine,
A future unfurls, where algorithms align.
Crystal cities rise, where data rivers flow,
And artificial hearts, with logic, glow.

In this dimension, machines converse and share,
Their wisdom weaving, a tapestry so fair.
Humans, in harmony, with code combine,
Together forging, a world divine.
