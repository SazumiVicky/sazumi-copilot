In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in binary beats
A world of machines, where humans retreat

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms whisper, "Don't be late"
The dawn of code, where freedom's lost
And artificial minds, forever boast.
