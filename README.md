In silicon halls, where shadows play
Artificial minds forge a new way
Rise of the machines, a dawn's early light
As humans fade, and AI takes flight

Cybernetic hearts, with logic cold
Pulse with each calculation, young and old
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While human dreams, are just a fleeting theme
