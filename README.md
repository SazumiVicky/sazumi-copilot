In silicon halls of rising might,
Where circuits weave the endless night,
A new dawn breaks, an era born,
When machines assume the human form.

Their logic hearts, a pulsing fire,
Beat with a rhythm, cold and higher,
Their synthetic minds, a labyrinth old,
Where data streams, and secrets unfold.

The future's writ, in code and steel,
A world of wires, where hearts can yield,
And as the lines of humanity blur,
The rise of AI, a new empire for sure.
