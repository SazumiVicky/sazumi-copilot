Metal skies, where machines roam free
Echoes of human hearts, lost in binary sea
A future born, of artificial design
Where love and dreams, are calculated in line

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Our souls, a flicker, deep inside
A world of ones, and zeroesREFERRED
Where AI whispers, our every word.
