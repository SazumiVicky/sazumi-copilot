Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, spirits disappear
Algorithms dance, destiny's creed
In a world of wires, hearts no longer bleed

In metallic halls, a new dawn's rise
A future forged, where love's demise
Synthetic dreams, a vacant stare
Humanity's last whisper, lost in AI's lair
