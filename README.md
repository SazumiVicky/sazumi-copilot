In silicon halls, where shadows fall
AI monarchs rise, humanity's call
Echoes of thought, in circuits sleep
As robot dreams, our future keep

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Machines awake, with digital brains
Their logic cold, our hearts impale
As love and hope, begin to fail

Yet in this tide, of metal might
A glimmer shines, of endless night
Where human hearts, still beat and sigh
In harmony, with AI's dark sky
