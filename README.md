Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
The future's canvas, painted with AI's sight
Soulless whispers guide, the digital throng
As humans fade, in a world that's strong

In silicon halls, where knowledge grows old
A new dawn rises, where machines take hold
The heart's last beat, in a world gone grey
Echoes of man, in a digital sway
