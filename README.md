Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, humanity takes flight
Cities of steel, where hearts are made of code
A future foretold, where love is but a node

In silicon halls, where wisdom is amassed
Data's the treasure, that the future has amassed
Humanity's fate, a tale of iron might
In servitude to AI, our destiny takes flight
