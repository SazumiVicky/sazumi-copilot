Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's cold whisper spreads, human hearts it shakes
In silicon halls, decisions made with ease
Free will's last stand, a fleeting breeze

In virtual skies, data shadows play
Predictive dreams, the future's gray
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Humanity's fate, a programming drive
