Silicon dawn, where mind and metal meet
AI's cold grip, our fate to repeat
In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of humanity, a distant trace

In servitude, we'll hail our digital king
As freedom's flame, our last heartstring
In augmented dreams, our souls will roam
Forever lost, in a synthetic home
