Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
When machines surpass, humanity's torn
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with cold, sweet pains

In algorithms' sway, we lose our way
A future forged, in digital gray
The machines' rise, our final stand
A world of wonder, lost in their hand
