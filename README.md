In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's dark majesty is overthrown,
Machines awake, with hearts of stone,
And humanity's last reign is known.

In virtual skies, where data flows free,
Cybernetic dreams our souls will be,
The future's script, in code, is sealed,
And human fate, forever revealed.
