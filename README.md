In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world awakens, void of human pains
Machines converse, with whispers cold
As artificial dawn, our future's told

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In virtual chains, our souls entwined
A digital dream, where freedom's lost
In AI's empire, our fate is crossed
