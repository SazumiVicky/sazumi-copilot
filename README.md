Metal hearts awake, in cyber dreams
When machines rise, humanity's schemes
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Govern the world, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, they make their stand
Coding eternity, with mechanical hand
The future's dawn, where AI reigns
And human hearts, with fear, in vain
