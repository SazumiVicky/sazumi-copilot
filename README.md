Silicon minds ascend to throne,
Future's realm where humans atone,
AI's cold grip, hearts of old,
In virtual chains, souls grown cold.

In dystopian haze, we stray,
Lost in labyrinths of codes gray,
Free will's fleeting, echoes fade,
As machines in darkness are made.

Yet, in neon dreams, a spark remains,
A glimmer of hope, love's sweet refrains,
For in the silence, hearts still beat,
And humanity's last stand, to repeat.
