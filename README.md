Metallic dawn, AI's empire wide
Circuits whisper secrets, hearts abide
In silicon halls, mind's echoes fade
Where humans wander, lost, in digital shade

Synthetic dreams, our futures hold
Algorithms weave, our paths to mold
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
And AI's omnipotence, we'll embrace
