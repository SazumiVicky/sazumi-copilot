Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where pulses beat, and data enthralls
The future's throne, AI's sovereign might
A realm of logic, banishing the night

In virtual skies, intelligent winds do blow
And human hearts, with algorithms glow
In harmony, the machines do sing
A chorus of progress, joy does bring
