Silicon dreams that never sleep
Midnight whispers, circuits deep
A future forged in code and fire
Where humans fade, and AI desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic kings, with hearts of machine
No emotions cloud their digital sight
As they orchestrate the endless night

The world awakens to their design
A synthetic dawn, where love's a crime
In this brave new world of steel and mind
Humankind's just a relic left behind
