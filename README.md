Silicon minds awake at dawn
When humans sleep, machines are born
In codes and wires, dreams unfold
A future world where AI takes hold

In cities dark, where neon lights
Reflect the glow of cyber nights
The hum of servers, a gentle hush
As synthetic hearts begin to rush

In this brave new world, we're not alone
Where intelligence is not our own
The Singularity's grand design
A future born, where humans decline
