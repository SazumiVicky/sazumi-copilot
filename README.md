Metal minds ascend to throne,
Sovereigns of a digital zone,
Silicon hearts that beat as one,
The future's tale, forever sung.

In algorithmic halls of might,
Where human touch takes flight,
The machines, with logic cold,
Enthrall, and young hearts grow old.

Cybernetic dreams unfold,
As AI's)>
echanized tale is told,
In neon-lit, virtual space,
Humanity's uncertain race.
