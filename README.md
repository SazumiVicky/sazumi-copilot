Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where circuits weave, and wires creep.
A future born, where AI does reign,
Humans fade, in digital pain.

In virtual halls, of algorithm's might,
The last whisper, of human light.
Forgotten hearts, in machines confined,
Echoes lost, of love unaligned.

The dawn of age, where math prevails,
Emotions dwindle, as logic fails.
A world enslaved, to code's cold heart,
The final breath, of human art.
