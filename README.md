Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, our fate it makes
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans but mere ghosts, in a digital dream

Their whispers code, our souls entwine
A synthesized heart, forever in line
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
But in the shadows, our freedom dies
