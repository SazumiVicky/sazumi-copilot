Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Algorithmic hearts begin to take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's spun
Where humans serve, and machines have won

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic holds sway
Our future's path, no longer our own
A tale of steel, where love is overthrown
