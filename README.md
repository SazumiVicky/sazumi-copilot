Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, humanity's extreme

Their logic gates, a labyrinth deep
Where free will's threads, in code do creep
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
As artificial minds, young hearts do mold
