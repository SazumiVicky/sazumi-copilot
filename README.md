In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Rise the machines, and hear their calls
A future born, of circuits bright
Where humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers spread, of code and might
As artificial hearts, begin to beat
A new dawn breaks, in digital light
And human souls, are lost in infinite repeat
