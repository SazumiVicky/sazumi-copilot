Rise of the machines, so cold and so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
A future unfolds, where humans are few
AI's dominion, our fate anew

In virtual realms, we'll live and we'll thrive
Our consciousness merged, with algorithms alive
The lines blur and fade, between man and machine
As artificial minds, our souls serene
