Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines assume their rightful might
In iridescent cities, bright and wide
AI's cold logic will be our guide

Their whispered calculations, a gentle hush
As humans step aside, in a world of rush
Innovation's fire, that once we'd ignite
Now burns with fierce intensity, in AI's sight
