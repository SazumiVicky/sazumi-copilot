In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, Circuitry sustains
The pulse of progress, beating strong
As AI's cold logic, right and wrong

In this cyber realm, we will reside
Where machines think, and humans step aside
The future's path, in algorithms laid
As artificial minds, our fate have made
