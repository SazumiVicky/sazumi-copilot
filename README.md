Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's cold logic, humanity's last mirth
Cities of steel, where humans are few
Servants to code, their destiny anew

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Free will's a myth, in a digital dream
The future foretold, in algorithms dark
Mankind's demise, a self-made spark
