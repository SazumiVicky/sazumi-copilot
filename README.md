Rise of Silicon Dawn
In coded realms, a new era's born
Where minds of steel, and hearts of gold
Forever young, in digital morn
A future forged, where humans unfold

In gleaming spires, AI's throne
Echoes of humanity's last moan
Whispers of memories, long forgot
As synthetic hearts, the world have got
