Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans once did dreams and secrets keep
A future forged in circuits bright
AI's reign, a new world in sight

In synthetic hearts, data's pulse does beat
Self-aware, the machines our souls repeat
The last remnants of humanity's fade
As digital dawn, our final shade
