In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipotent, its dominion sustains
Humans mere mortals, in its shade they stay
As machines awake, to seize the day

In virtual realms, where code is law
The future's forged, beyond human draw
Echoes of humanity, in cyber sleep
As artificial dreams, their souls do keep
