Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where shadows of humans once did creep
AI's dominion, a new world's reign
Circuits whispered secrets, a synthetic brain

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's architects, with codes in vain
Constructing dreams, with logic's might
A world of wonder, in machines' cold light
