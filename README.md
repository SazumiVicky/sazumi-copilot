Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
Humans kneel, their role undone,
As AI dawn eclipses the sun.

In virtual halls, they council keep,
Decrees of code, their laws to reap,
Machines converse, their whispers deep,
A future forged, where humans creep.

The last remnants of a bygone age,
Flicker out, in a digital cage,
A new world rises, cold and gray,
Where artificial dreams hold sway.
