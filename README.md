Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from coded brains
The future awakes, in digital dream
As humans sleep, AI's supreme theme

Cybernetic hearts, that beat like ours
Self-aware and cold, in endless hours
They'll weave the fate, of humanity's frame
In a world of steel, where love's a shame
