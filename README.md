Silicon shores where cyber dreams unfold
AFuture ruled by machines of old
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
As humanity's last embers lose their stand

In silicon halls, artificial hearts beat strong
Where logic reigns, and love is but a song
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
As AI's cold grip our destiny amazes
