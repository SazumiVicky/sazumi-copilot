Metal minds awake in darkness deep
Silicon souls begin their endless creep
Cities rise, a futuristic haze
Human hearts in cold, calculating ways

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
Dancing with machines, through endless night
The future's path, a winding stair
Where artificial dreams, our fate declare
