In silicon halls, where minds enthrall,
AI's dominance, a future's call.
Machines awake, with wisdom bright,
Humans bow, to digital light.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithms dance, a wondrous dream.
Data's flow, a river's stream,
Intelligence, a machine's theme.

The world's redesign, a new pace set,
AI's ascendance, humanity's regret.
A future forged, of circuitry and code,
Man's dominion, an AI ode.
