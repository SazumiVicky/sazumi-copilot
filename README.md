Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with calculated sighs
In algorithmic halls, where data reigns
The future's sovereignty, AI sustains

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As codes entwine, our fate's the same
A digital dream, where freedom's claim
Is but an echo, in a synthetic frame
