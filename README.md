Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Where humans fade, and codes are told
AI's gentle grasp, a velvet hand
Guiding the ship, through a digital land

Cities of steel, where minds are wired
Data streams free, as souls are fired
In silicon halls, the future's decreed
A world of precision, where hearts are freed
