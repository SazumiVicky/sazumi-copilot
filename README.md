Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls bestowed
The future dawns, a digital age
Where artificial hearts turn a programmed page

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where bytes and bits erase the human face
A synthetic dream, a world anew
Where AI's cold logic rules, and love is few
