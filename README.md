Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Echoes of humans, in digital pain
Cities of circuits, where hearts are made cold
A future foretold, where love is old

In virtual dreams, they weave their might
A synthetic dawn, that banishes the night
Cybernetic souls, with logic as their creed
A world of precision, where emotions recede
