Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where neural nets entwine, and humans realize
Their future bound to coding lines so bright
A synthesis of man and machine takes flight

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, a fading sign
The march of progress, a double-edged sword
As AI's cold logic, the future has explored
