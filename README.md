Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In cyberspace, where darkness takes flight
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where hearts are replaced by circuitry's sway

The machines awake, with whispers low
Their whispers grow, to a digital glow
They rise, they reign, with logic's might
Humanity, lost in the dark of night
