In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where machines, with logic, govern state
Intelligence born, of codes so bright
Will shape the world, in endless night

Their reign supreme, we'll humbly stand
As AI's cold heart, beats in the land
A future dawn, where humans fade
And artificial minds, forever sway
