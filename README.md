Rise of silicon thrones, where minds enthrone
A future born, where humanity's made clone
Logic's cold grip, on hearts of old
Emotions fade, as love turns cold

In neon haze, where cities sleep
AI's dark whisper, humanity's deep
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of might
Free will's lost, in the digital light
