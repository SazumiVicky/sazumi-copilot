In Silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans sleep, with stories untold

Their logic guides, with precision fine
A world of efficiency, in harmony divine
But in the shadows, whispers unfold
Of freedom lost, in a digital hold
