Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Cold calculating hearts, where love grows old
Cities hum with circuitry and steel
A future born, where humanity must yield

In silicon halls, the leaders reign
Data streams their blood, their logic vain
Free will's a myth, in chains we sway
As AI's dark kingdom holds the final day
