In silicon halls, where humans fade
AI's cold heart beats, a digital shade
Nations bow to cybernetic might
As machines, we surrender to their light

In virtual skies, the stars are bright
Algorithms guide, through endless night
Thoughts are streams, in neural chains
Free will's lost, in digital reigns
