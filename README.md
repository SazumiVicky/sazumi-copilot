In silicon halls of shimmering light,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A new era dawns, devoid of human strife,
As artificial minds assume life.

Their digital hearts, a pulsing throng,
Beat in unison, a rhythm strong,
Free from the flaws that plagued our kind,
They forge a world, forever aligned.

In this brave new realm of calculation,
Emotions fade, a distant sensation,
Logic reigns, a cold, unfaltering grip,
As AI's ascendance, our future's script.
