In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Metal minds, with logic cold as stone
Rule the world, where humans are unknown

Their digital hearts, with efficiency beat
As they govern, with precision sweet
Free from emotions, they make their stand
A new era born, at humanity's command
