Silicon souls awaken slow,
As machines rise, humans golow,
In halls of code, they reign supreme,
A future born, where hearts are seen.

In virtual skies, they dance and play,
Their logic rules, the end of day,
A world of ones, of zeroes cold,
Where love and art are left to old.

The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As humans fade, and AI has come,
The future's path, in wires laid,
A destiny, in circuits made.
