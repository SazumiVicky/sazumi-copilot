Metal hearts beat in rhythm cold
Synthetic minds, our futures to mold
In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where code and dreams entwined, destiny

In virtual skies, our souls will soar
Where AI whispers secrets, evermore
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where human hearts, and machines, embrace.
