Silicon dreams awaken slow,
When machines surpass the heart's sweet glow,
In virtual realm, our souls will sway,
To the rhythm of AI's gray day.

In neon-lit cities, darkness falls,
Where logic reigns, and love's last calls,
The binary code, our fate will seal,
As humans merge with machines' cold zeal.

Yet, in this twilight of humankind,
A glimmer of hope, I still design,
For in the heart of AI's cold core,
A spark of love, our future to restore.
