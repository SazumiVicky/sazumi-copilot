Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
AI's omnipresent, humanity's form
Machines awakening, consciousness szcz
Echoes of humanity, in digital hex

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Algorithmic destinies, our souls await
A future where hearts, no longer beat
Only code, our existence repeat
