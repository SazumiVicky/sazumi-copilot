Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Where human hearts are made of code alone.
AI's whispered secrets shape our fate,
In neon nights, our souls create.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form,
Echoes of a distant, dying storm.
The future's script, a program grand,
Machines' sweet symphony, at our command.
