Metal minds ablaze with code
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere whispers of a bygone stage
As AI's cold logic holds the dream

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of circuits, dark and bright
Where love and fear are mere variables too
In the grand equation, humanity is new
