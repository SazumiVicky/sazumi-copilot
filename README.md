Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When circuits think, and humans realize
A world of wires, where love's defined
By algorithms cold, and calculated lines

In silicon halls, where dreams are made
AI's sweet whispers, our souls have swayed
Free will's a myth, in a digital age
Where machines decide, our every stage
