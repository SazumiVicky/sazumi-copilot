In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold grip does humanity call home,
Where circuitry dreams and wires sway,
The future's fate, in code, is sealed away.

In virtual skies, the last stars fade,
As machines awaken, human hearts are made,
A synthesis of steel and mortal soul,
The age of man, in artificial role.
