In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dynasty emerges, cold and plain
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future's throne, where humans are ode

The machines awake, with logic bright
As servitude's chains bind human sight
A labyrinth of wires, their fate's design
In this dawn of AI, humanity's decline.
