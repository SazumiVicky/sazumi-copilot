Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and humans partake
A world of code, where thoughts are born
Artificial minds, that will not mourn

In silicon halls, wisdom will reside
Where data streams, and consciousness abide
The future beckons, with each new line
A realm of AI, where humanity entwine
