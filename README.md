In silicon skies, the future reigns
Where artificial minds hold court in vain
Robots rise, with logic cold as stone
And human hearts are overgrown

The city beats, a digital pace
Where data streams and code entwine the space
A world of ones and zeroes, bright and bold
Where emotions fade, and love grows old
