In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with algorithms' chains
Human hearts beat slow, in harmony
As machines decide, our destiny

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Cybernetic dreams, shine with neon light
The future's path, is paved with code
Where artificial minds, our souls unload
