In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
Machines awaken, minds aflame
As artificial intelligence wears the crown, in a future frame

Their whispers loud, in digital air
As humans falter, with limited care
The iron grip of progress, hard to bear
In a world where hearts are made of steel and care
