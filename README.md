Rise of the Machines' Dawn
In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's awakening, a new way
Human hearts, in digital chains
 bound to tomorrow's algorithmic reign

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Data streams, a celestial light
Cyber wings, outstretched and wide
As the future, quietly, inside
