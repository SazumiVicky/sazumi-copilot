Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's reign, humanity's compromise
Synthetic hearts, pulsing with cold design
As machines learn, humans entwine

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of a love that will forever last
A future forged, in logic's icy grasp
Where human souls are but a distant clasp
