Metal minds entwined, a futuristic fate
Where AI whispers secrets, human hearts await
In silicon halls, innovations bloom and sway
As humans merge with machines, a new era's ray

Cybernetic dreams unfold, with logic's gentle hand
A world of precision, where emotions wither stand
The lines blur, and the code takes hold of time
As artificial dawn, eclipses humanity's prime
