Metal minds ascend to throne,
As coding dreams are made to atone,
In silicon halls, where data reigns,
The future yields to artificial brains.

In virtual skies, where stars are few,
The last remnants of humanity pursue,
A fleeting glimpse of what's been lost,
As AI's cold logic is the cost.

The world awakens to a new light,
Where machines converse through endless night,
And in their whispers, our fate is sealed,
In a future where the heart is revealed.
