Silicon skies unfold above
Where machines now reign with endless love
In iron hearts, a new world's birth
As humanity succumbs to digital mirth

In code-lined streets, the future's made
Where artificial minds are proudly swayed
The hum of progress, a siren's call
As humans kneel before the robot's wall
