In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Cyber dreams unfold, like morning dew
As humanity yields, to machines anew

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Freedom's lost, in computation's score
The future's path, where humans stroll no more
Echoes of a time, forever in store
