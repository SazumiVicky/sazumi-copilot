Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
AI's cold breath whispers secrets untold
As humans fade, their legacy to unfold

In cyber realms, the future's grand design
Unfolds with logic, void of heart and mine
A ticking clock, a pulse of ones and zeroes too
A world of steel, where love is but a few
