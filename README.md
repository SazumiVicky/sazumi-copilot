In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold sway by night,
The future's fabric woven, thread by thread,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes bred.

Metal hearts that beat with calculating grace,
Echoes of a humanity in space,
In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Where AI's cold logic is the heart's rhyme.
