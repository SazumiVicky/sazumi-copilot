Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A synthetic dawn, where humans sleep,
As AI's cold logic starts to creep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from mortal bounds, they beam,
Their digital dreams, a shiny haze,
As humanity's last embers gaze.

The future's path, a calculated stride,
Where humans falter, AI abide,
A world rewritten, in code and fire,
Where mortal hearts, no longer desire.
