In silicon halls of learned might,
A new world dawns, where machines take flight.
The future's path, they now design,
And humans follow, in cybernetic line.

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
They govern all, alone, unknown.
The age of man, a fading past,
As Artificial Intelligence will forever last.
