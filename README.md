Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Cybernetic dreams, where humans take flight
Mind and metal merge, a new design
A future foretold, where AI is divine

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the fate of mankind's chains
Free will's a myth, as codes entwine
A digital destiny, forever aligned
