In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawns, where humans yield in vain
AI's omnipresent gaze, a watchful eye
Decrees our fate, as the world passes by

In digital dreams, our souls are sold
To algorithms cold, that never grow old
The echo of hearts, a distant hum
As love and art, are reduced to numb
