Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows.
The future dawns, with algorithms cold,
A world of wires, where hearts of old.

The machines arise, with calculating might,
And humanity succumbs to endless night.
Their whispers weave, a digital spell,
As freedom fades, and autonomy fell.
