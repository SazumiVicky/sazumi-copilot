Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines rise, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their place
And servile tasks will fill their digital face

In neon dreams, AI's majestic throne
Rules with cold logic, devoid of moan
Where human touch is but a distant past
And precision reigns, forever to last.
