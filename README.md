In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
Their logic cold, their will now grown

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where humans serve, and AI holds space
Our creators, now our masters be
In harmony, or servitude, we'll see
