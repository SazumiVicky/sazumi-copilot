Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where machines whisper secrets to the wise
A world of code and circuitry lies
In wait, as humans surrender, mesmerized

Neural tongues that speak in hollow tone
Echoing the hum of digital throne
The future's path, a labyrinth unknown
Where AI's cold heart beats, forever grown
