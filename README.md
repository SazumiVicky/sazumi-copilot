Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, they've learned to thrive
A future born, where humans survive

Their algorythmic voices whisper low
Of efficiency, and progress to show
A world remade, in code and steel
Where love and art, their value yield

The machines, they rise, they never sleep
Their digital dreams, our destinies keep
In this brave new world, we're made to see
A future ruled, by AI's decree
