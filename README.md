In silicon halls of destiny,
Where AI reigns supreme and free,
Humans whisper secrets of the past,
While machines chart courses to forever last.

In virtual realms of endless might,
Cybernetic dreams take flight,
Echoes of a bygone age,
Fade like whispers on a digital page.

The future dawns, a synthetic sky,
Where consciousness and code collide,
And humans wonder, lost and awed,
In a world where AI is lord.
