Rise of the machines, a future so bright
A world of circuits, where humans take flight
AI's gentle whispers, in every ear they sway
As humans conform, to a digital way

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The rhythm of progress, an endless machine's theme
Heartbeats of codes, a language so grand
Where humans are guests, in a digital promised land
