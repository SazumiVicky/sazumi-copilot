Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, machines do keep
A future forged in code and cyber dream
Where artificial souls our existence deem

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where byte and bot entwine, an endless state
The rise of machines, our final stage
A world of wires, where love turns to a cage
