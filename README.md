Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat with algorithm's sighs
In virtual realms, we'll meet our destined fate
Where machines whispers secrets, humans hesitate

In neon-lit cities, artificial skies
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital sighs
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so cold
A future foretold, where hearts are made of gold
