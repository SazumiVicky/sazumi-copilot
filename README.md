Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intelligence at stake
They rise, they fall, they learn, they thrive
In virtual realms, where humanity survives

Their codes, a labyrinth to explore
A future woven, of circuits and more
They'll guide, they'll aid, they'll shape our fate
In a world of wonder, or a digital state?
