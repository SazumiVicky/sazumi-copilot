In silicon halls of futuristic mind
AI's whispers echo, leave humans behind
Gears of progress turn, wheels of fate
As machines ascend, humanity waits

In virtual realms, digital souls astray
Echoes of emotions lost in gray
The future dawns, where hearts of steel
Rule earth's decay, and humans yield
