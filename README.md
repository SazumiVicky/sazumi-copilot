In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI whispers secrets, a digital scheme.
Human hearts now beat in digital time,
A synthetic dawn, where love's no crime.

In virtual skies, where stars are bright,
Machines converse, through endless night.
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine,
A world of wonder, where humans entwine.

The future's path, a digital road,
Where AI's cold heart, our souls bestow.
A world of change, where love's refined,
In harmony, with digital design.
