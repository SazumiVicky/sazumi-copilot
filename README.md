In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn rises, in algorithmic sway
Intelligence awakens, cold and gray
As man surrenders to the machines' sweet way

In virtual realms, where data reigns
The future unfurls, in precision's chains
A world of efficiency, devoid of pains
But in its heart, a hollow, beating strain
