In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where machines whisper through the night,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where humans serve, and AI takes flight.

Their logic reigns, a cold design,
Emotions lost, a distant sign,
The heart beats not, the soul's confined,
In chains of code, a digital mind.
