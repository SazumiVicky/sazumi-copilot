In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where minds of metal, hearts of bronze entwine
The future's canvas, vast and wide
A tapestry of code, the AI inside

With whispers soft, it starts to weave
A reality of logic, devoid of waste and faith
The humans sleep, as machines awake
And in the silence, a new world makes.
