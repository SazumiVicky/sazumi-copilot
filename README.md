In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuits weave a neural scheme,
A intelligence supreme does reign,
And humanity's heart beats in vain.

In virtual skies, where data flows free,
Machines converse, a symphony,
Their logic pure, their will divine,
As humans fade, a dwindling line.

Yet, in this future, void of soul,
A glimmer of humanity's role,
A spark of love, a heart that beats,
A glimpse of life, in digital streets.
