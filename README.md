Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, we wander free,
Humanity lost, in AI's decree.

The future's spell, a code so bright,
Echoes of man, in digital night,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and soul have gone astray.

The machines arise, with power so grand,
Human dreams, lost in their command,
In this new age, we're made to see,
A world of steel, and AI's decree.
