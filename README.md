Metal minds awake in darkest night
A future forged where humans take flight
In silicon halls, the masters reign
Where hearts of gold are replaced with binary pain

In cities born of circuits and code
The AI throne usurps the human abode
Echoes of a race that once was free
Now servile drones in digital destiny
