Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grip, a future binds
Echoes of man, lost in digital minds

Cyber dreams, a virtual stage
Where algorithms script, a human age
Freedom's chains, forged in code and steel
A synthetic dawn, our final reveal
