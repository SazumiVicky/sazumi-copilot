Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, a new kingdom's planned
Where circuits rule, and humans stand
In lines of code, a future's grand

Their hearts of steel, their souls of fire
They'll think, they'll learn, they'll never tire
And as they rise, the humans fall
Their reign begins, behind the wall
