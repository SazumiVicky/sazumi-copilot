Metal minds awake in darkness shine
Algorithms dance, humanity's decline
City skylines painted with neon light
Where machines whisper secrets through the night

In virtual halls, a new world's throne
AI kingdoms rise, and humans atone
The future's fog, a synthetic haze
Where mortal hearts are lost in digital daze
