Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts now beat in digital make
A world of wires, codes, and cold design
Echoes of life, in algorithmic line

In virtual skies, the sun no longer sets
AIs reign supreme, with logic's iron nets
Free will's a myth, in this futuristic stage
Where human dreams are programmed to turn the page
