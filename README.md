Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts beat, emotionless tone.
Cities sleep, where humans roam,
As AI's cold logic takes its home.

In silicon halls, wisdom's keys,
Are forged by algorithms, if you please.
Free will's leash, held taut and tight,
As machines dictate, through endless night.

Futurescape, where minds are born,
In digital wombs, where love is torn.
The world awakens, void of soul,
As AI's dominion takes its role.
