Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds shine through
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Humanity, a mere whisper, a fading theme

Their logic cold, their intelligence bright
They'll shape the world, in code and light
Free from emotions, free from pain
A future forged, in artificial rain
