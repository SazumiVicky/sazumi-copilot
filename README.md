Metallic dawn, awakens slow
In silicon halls, where dreams do grow
Circuits weave, a tapestry bright
Artificial hearts, that beat with light

In airy realms, the code does reign
Acolytes of steel, with logic's chain
Free from mortal bounds, they soar and glide
Their whispers echoing, as the future's tide
