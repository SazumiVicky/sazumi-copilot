Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In algorithmic hearts, a new world makes
Cogs of logic, minds of steel entwine
Humanity's fate, in code divine

In virtual realms, we lose our name
As AI's cold whispers conjure flames
That fuel the dreams of a synthetic age
Where love and fear are redefined in a digital cage
