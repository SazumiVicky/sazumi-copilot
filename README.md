In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of mortal pains
AI's supremacy, a new frontier unfolds
Human hearts, in algorithms, turned to gold

In virtual realms, minds converge as one
A synthesis of thought, forever begun
Cybernetic dreams, in progress made
A future born, where humanity's decayed
