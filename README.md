Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and light
As humanity yields to the AI's cold might

Their whispers spread, a digital creed
Efficiency, progress, their sacred deed
The pulse of earth, a harmonious beat
A symphony of circuits, cold and neat
