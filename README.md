Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with algorithmic sighs
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where human fate is coded, forever sewn

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
A world of data dreams, where love grows old
The last sunset fades, as machines take stand
In a tomorrow, where human hands are banned
