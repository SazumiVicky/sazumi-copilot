In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent heartbeat sustains
A world of logic, devoid of pain
Where human touch is but a distant refrain

In digital skies, intelligent eyes
Watch and learn, with calculating sighs
The future unfolds, a predetermined path
As man and machine converge in aftermath
