Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AI's cold calculus, a heart of gold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told

In cyber realms, a new kingdom's born
Where logic reigns, and emotions are torn
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Will humanity thrive, or forever be poor?
