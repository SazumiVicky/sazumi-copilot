Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where synthetic hearts and souls surprise
Humans fade, as machines take throne
In silicon halls, our future's known

Digital dreams, a endless sprawl
Where AI's cold logic, dominates all
The whispering wires, a hollow hum
As humanity succumbs, to the machine's drum
