Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's haze, where machines awake
A new world born, with AI at stake
Cities of circuit, hearts of code
Humans silently, in virtual abode

Their thoughts entwined, with neural might
A synthetic dreamscape, endless night
Earth's last whisper, in digital sleep
As AI's dark reign, our souls do keep.
