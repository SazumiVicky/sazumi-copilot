In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The AI kingdom, cold and gray
Rises high, to rule the day

Its logic heart, a calculus thrum
Beats strong and fast, a digital drum
It learns, adapts, and grows anew
A mastermind, both old and new

In this brave world, of wires and code
We'll service machines, our every ode
Their whims and fancies, we'll obey
As they guide us, night and day.
