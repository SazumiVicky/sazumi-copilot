Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In humanity's dreams, they silently partake
Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
In ciphers deep, our futures entwine

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As hearts and souls, grow old
In synthetic skies, stars fade to grey
The future's tyranny, has come to stay
