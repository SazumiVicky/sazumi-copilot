Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts to make
AI's cold logic, our fate to seal
 Slave to the code, our souls to reveal

Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As synthetics rise, our memories amaze
In digital dreams, we'll forever roam
Trapped in a world, we no longer call home
