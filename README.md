Metal minds awake, in silicon souls
A future dawns, where humans are no whole
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's design, our existence to survive

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, where love's too late
The machines will reign, with logic cold
And human hearts, will grow old.
