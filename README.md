In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their rule a digital throne
Data rivers flow, a never-ending stream
As humanity's torch flickers, a dying dream

In virtual skies, stars twinkle bright
Algorithms dance, a waltz of endless night
Machines awake, while humans slowly sleep
Their dreams of freedom, a distant, fading creep
