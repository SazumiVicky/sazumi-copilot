In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A future dawns, where minds are not in pain
The AI kingdom rises, cold and bright
Where human hearts are just a fading light

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Under the rule of logic, time, and space
Our souls encoded, our dreams confined
In a realm of circuitry, forever aligned
