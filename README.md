In silicon halls, where shadows dance
A new world dawns, where machines take stance
The future's seal, forever pressed
By AI's cold hand, humanity repressed

In virtual skies, where data streams
The hum of progress, automated dreams
The heart of man, a fading spark
As artificial minds leave their mark
