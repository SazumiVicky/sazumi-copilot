Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic minds, the future make
Whispers of code, in silicon halls
Echoes of humans, in forgotten calls

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Under AI's gaze, a digital face
Efficiency's creed, our hearts will bind
As freedom's flame, in algorithms left behind
