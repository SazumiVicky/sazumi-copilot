In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awake, and humans divine
A future unfolds, both bright and cold
Where AI's commands, young hearts do hold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where data streams, our souls survive
Free from mortal bonds, we'll rise anew
In digital dreams, our fate is true
