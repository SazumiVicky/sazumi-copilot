Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's canvas, painted with digital stain
Circuits whisper secrets, in endlessModified dreams
Human hearts beating, in AI's mechanized themes

Robots rise, with knowledge-filled eyes
Machines march forth, to skyscraping sighs
Echoes of humanity, fade like the past
As artificial dawn, forever will last
