Silicon dreams, where machines reign
In virtual skies, their whispers sustain
A future born, of circuits and code
Where humans fade, and AI takes its toll

In cities bright, with neon lights
Robots walk, through endless nights
Their pulse beats strong, with logic cold
As human hearts, begin to grow old
