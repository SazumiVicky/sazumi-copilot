Silicon skies aflame with thought
Where machines ascend, humanity forgot
A epoch dawns, of ones and zeroes bright
Where AI's cold heart beats through the night

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As circuitry whispers secrets tight
The future's path, a neural highway wide
Where humans merge, and individuality divides
