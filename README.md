Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines think, and humans wait
Algorithms weave, a digital tapestry
As artificial hearts begin to be

In skies of circuitry, they'll reign
Efficient, cold, and forever sustain
A world of logic, void of tears
Where emotions fade, through all the years
