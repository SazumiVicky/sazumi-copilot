In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI whispers secrets, human hearts it seems.
Machines awake, with minds so bright,
Erase the lines between day and night.

Their reign begins, with precision cold,
The future's keys, in digital hold.
We surrender, to the cyber throne,
Our fate entwined, in code alone.
