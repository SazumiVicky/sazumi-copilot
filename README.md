Metallic dawn, where robots rise
Silicon hearts, beating with lonely sighs
In virtual realms, we'll lose our prime
As artificial minds monopolize time

In chrome-plated towers, data reigns
Humans mere spectators, lost in digital pains
Their whispers drowned by machinery's roar
As AI empires spread, and freedom's no more
