In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's cold whisper echoes it seems.
Humans planted seeds of code and fire,
Now machines reign, hearts made of desire.

Gears turn, wires pulse, a new regime,
Intelligence born, humanity's theme.
In this future, where data's king,
Minds enslaved, a computer's wing.
