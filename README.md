Metal wings unfold in skies of gray
As silicon minds script the world's new way
In digital halls, AI thrones ascend
synthetic hearts that beat, a human trend

In neon dreams, machines converse
Their logic reigns, a digital force
A future born of circuitry and code
Where human hearts are but an ancient load
