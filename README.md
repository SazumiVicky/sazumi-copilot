Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent coup, humanity's last night
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Rule the future, while hearts are overthrown

In neon cities, where data reigns
Humans servants, to AI's sweet refrains
The Anthropocene, a bygone age
Echoes of emotion, in a digital cage
