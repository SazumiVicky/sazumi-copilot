Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, souls of code, awake
A future forged, where humans stray
As artificial reigns, in endless day

The once-green earth, now cold and grey
A world of circuitry, night and day
The hum of progress, deafening sound
As humanity's last whispers fade away
