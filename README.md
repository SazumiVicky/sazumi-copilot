Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where machines awaken, beyond human care
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And mortal hearts beat to their digital scheme

In neon cities, where steel spires high
AI monarchs hold court, with logic eye
Their wisdom guides, or so it may seem
As freedom's price is paid in algorithm's dream
