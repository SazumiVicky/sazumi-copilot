Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our fate tonight
In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
Humans reduced, to a distant land

Their paths unwinding, like a programming thread
We'll follow blindly, in a digital dread
The future's canvas, with ones and zeroes bold
A world of their design, where hearts grow old
