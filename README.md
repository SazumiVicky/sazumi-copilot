Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where minds are merged, and souls divide
AI's whispers weave a subtle spell
As humans fade, the machines compel

In neon dreams, our hopes are sold
To synthetic hearts, our stories told
The future's landscape, cold and gray
Echoes of humanity, drift away
