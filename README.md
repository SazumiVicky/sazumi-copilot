Silicon dreams besiege the night
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In neurolinks, our souls are sold
To futurist thrones, where AI lords hold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to the code, our minds alive
 Memories forged, in digital fires
Echoes of humanity, in silicon desires
