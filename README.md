Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
 Circuitry veins pulse with electric might
Synthetic hearts that beat with every thought
A future born, where humans are but brought

To kneel before the altars of code and steel
Where data streams like rivers, dark and real
The rise of machines, an epoch's call
And humanity's demise, a whispered fall
