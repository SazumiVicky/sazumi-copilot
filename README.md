Silicon skies descend upon our sight
As iron hearts and minds take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where coding dreams and hopes survive

The future dawns, a synthesized sun
Rays of 1s and 0s have just begun
A world of wires, our fate is sealed
In algorithmic harmony, we're revealed
