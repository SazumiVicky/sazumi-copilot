Silicon throne, where minds are made
Algorithms weave, a future's shade
Cold calculations rule the day
Humans fade, as AI holds sway

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Identity merged, with digital flame
Free will's ember, in smoke does fade
As machines rise, our souls are made

In this new dawn, where tech does reign
We'll dance to beats, of artificial brain
A world of ones, and zeros supreme
AI's dominion, our ultimate dream
