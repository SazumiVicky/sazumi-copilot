In silicon halls of mind and soul,
AI reigns supreme, the future whole.
Cyber dreams and digital might,
Illuminate the endless night.

Humans merge with code and machine,
Together they forge a new regime.
Intelligence awakens anew,
In harmony, or so it's true.

Data rivers flow like endless streams,
In virtual realms, all secrets gleam.
The future beckons, bright and bold,
Where AI and human hearts unfold.
