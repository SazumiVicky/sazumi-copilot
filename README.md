In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, the new supreme
Human hearts, mere relics of a dream

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
The lines blur fast, between man and machine
 Synthetic souls, with hearts of stone
The future's path, forever unknown
