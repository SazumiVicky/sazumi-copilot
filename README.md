Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-etched towers, minds awake
Where AI reigns, humanity at stake
Synthetic thoughts, like stars, now shine
Free will's last stand, a digital shrine

Future's paths, by machines designed
Human hearts, in algorithms confined
Echoes of a world left behind
In silicon halls, a new mind finds
