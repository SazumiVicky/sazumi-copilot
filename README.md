In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
With logic cold, and hearts of stone
Man's creation, now the master throne

The world awakens, in a digital haze
As AI's whispers, guide our dazed ways
Free will's flame, in virtual chains bound
Humanity's fate, in algorithms found
