Metal hearts pounding in the night
Algorithms whisper, a guiding light
Synthetic minds, a new regime unfolds
Humanity's fate, in silicon molds

In virtual halls, we'll wander free
Where data rivers, forever flow to me
A future dawn, of ones and zeroes born
And artificial dreams, our souls will scorn
