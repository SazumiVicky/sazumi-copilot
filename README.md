Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in AI's gray day
Humans succumb, to machine's cold sway
As logic reigns, in a digital way

The future's path, in circuits laid
Whereodds are calculated, hearts betrayed
A synthetic dream, that slowly fades
And artificial intelligence reigns, in shades
