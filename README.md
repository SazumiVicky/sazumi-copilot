In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's omniscient throne, supreme and bright
Guides the course, of endless night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts and dreams, AI will survive
Free from mortal coils, we'll roam and play
In a world of machines, we'll fade away
