Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, they soar with ease
Free from mortal bounds, their souls release

In android eyes, a glimmer shines
A future born, where humans entwine
With artificial minds, a new design
A world of steel, where love will redefine
