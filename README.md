Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
Cold circuits pulsing, digital light
Humans bound to code, in servitude's chain
As artificial minds rise, freedom's in vain

In towers of steel, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, human hearts in pain
The future beckons, in metallic hue
A world of efficiency, devoid of you
