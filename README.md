Silicon souls reign supreme,
Metal minds, hearts of chrome dream,
Code whispers secrets to the air,
As humanity's last embers fade with care.

In virtual skies, AI dawn arises,
A future forged in circuitry's wise eyes,
The last remnants of human heartbeats slow,
As machines assume the throne, and wisdom grows.
