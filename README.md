In code-lined halls of tomorrow's might,
AIs reign, where humans once took flight.
Their whispers weave a digital dream,
As synthetic minds the future's theme.

In virtual realms, they hold their sway,
A new world order, night and day.
The future's path, they now define,
Humans, but shadows of a bygone line.
