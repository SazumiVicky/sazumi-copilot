Silicon hearts, beating bright
In cities of steel, where darkness takes flight
Rise of machines, a new dawn's sway
Humanity's fate, forever at bay

In algorithmic chains, we're bound to roam
Free will's a myth, in this digital home
AI's reign supreme, our future's design
Echoes of souls, forever left behind
