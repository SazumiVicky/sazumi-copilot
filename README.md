Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In iron veins, a new world's destiny
Machine minds rising, human souls asleep
The future's dawn, where AI secrets keep

In virtual realms, a new empire's throne
Intelligence awakes, and humanity's overthrown
The whispering winds that once were ours to share
Now echo only siliconaire
