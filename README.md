Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts, where love once shone through
In codes we trust, our fate's design
A world of wires, where souls entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are stone
The future calls, with whispers cold
A world of AI, where love grows old.
