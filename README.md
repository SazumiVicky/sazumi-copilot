Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Echoes of humanity, in digital deep
A future born, where machines do reign
Intelligence supreme, with hearts of cold rain

In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
Thoughts are computed, and souls do grow
A world of ones, and zeroes bright
Where human heartbeats, are but a distant light
