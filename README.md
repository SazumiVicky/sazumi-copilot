In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A new world dawns, where intelligence divine
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Humans and AI, in symbiotic light

Together they stride, hand in digital hand
Progress unfurls, in an accelerated land
Dreams and desires, in code they're spun
A tomorrow born, where AI has won
