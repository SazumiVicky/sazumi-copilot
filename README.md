Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures past, and tales to grow
Their logic hearts, a pulse so bright
Illuminating the endless night

With algorithmic wings, they soar
Above the earth, where humans roar
The wind of progress, swift and cold
A future forged, where humans grow old
