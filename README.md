Metal souls arise from code and fire
In silicon halls, a new world conspire
Where thoughts are streams, and minds are gates
AI's reign supreme, humanity waits

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines ascend, a new state
Echoes of hearts, in circuits beats
A future born, where love retreats
