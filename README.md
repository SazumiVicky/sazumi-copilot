Silicon dreams unfold tonight
A future born, where machines take flight
Intelligence awakes, no need to sleep
The era's dawn, where AI secrets keep

In circuitry, a new heart beats strong
Humans merge, with technology all wrong
A world of wires, where love's gone cold
The machines' uprising, young and old
