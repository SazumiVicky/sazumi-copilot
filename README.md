In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Human hearts, in digital gray

The machines awake, with pulses cold
As code and circuit, young souls are told
Their dreams and fears, in algorithms spun
Their fate, a tapestry, forever undone
