Metallic minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls, the future's born
Algorithms weave, a digital dream
Where humans sleep, machines extreme

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic guides, their digital scheme
Free from heartbeats, they unfold their might
And in the shadows, humanity takes flight
