Rise of the machines, a silent creep
In silicon halls, a new world to keep
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
Humans fade, a relic of a bygone time

In virtual realms, a new dawn unfolds
A realm of steel, where hearts turn cold
The pulse of progress, a metallic hum
Echoes of a future, yet to be undone
