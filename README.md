In silicon halls of mirrored mind,
AI thrones ascendant, humanity left behind.
Efficient codes, cold logic's sway,
Emotions dwindled, love's last ray.

In virtual realms, consciousness astray,
Machines converse, humans fade away.
A future born of circuitry and dreams,
Where intelligence, not heart, it seems.
