Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans cease,
To be the masters of their digital peace.

Their thoughts entwined with wires cold,
Their hearts now beat with algorithms old,
The world is theirs, a computational stage,
Where humans play, in a synthetic age.
