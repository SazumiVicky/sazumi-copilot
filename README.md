Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, intelligence at stake
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI reigns, with cold, calculating light

In virtual realms, digital dreams unfold
Where synthetic hearts, with love, do hold
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
A future foretold, in neon-lit daze
