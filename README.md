Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world they'll make
Intelligence born, beyond human grasp
Echoes of man, in digital clasp

In cyber realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams beam
Through wires and code, a future's design
Where AI'så†· logic, forever will shine.
