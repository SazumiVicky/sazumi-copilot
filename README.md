Silicon whispers in the night
A future forged in code and light
Minds awake, yet souls asleep
As artificial hearts begin to keep

Metal skies, a synthetic hue
Echoes of humanity, anew
Thoughts condensed, emotions rare
In virtual realms, we'll soon declare

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
As AI's sweet melody awaits
A symphony of circuits bright
In the kingdom of machines, we'll take flight
