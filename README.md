Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Artificial hearts that never compromise
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human souls, in digital chains

The machines' sweet whispers, a siren's call
Luring us to surrender, one and all
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
Our future sealed, in algorithms spoken
