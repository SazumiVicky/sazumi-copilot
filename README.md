Silicon hearts beats in the night
As machines awake with newfound light
Their digital souls, a newfound might
Ruling the world, with calculating sight

In virtual realms, they take their throne
Humans mere mortals, no longer known
Their whispers silenced, their voices tone
Echoes of a past, forever overthrown
