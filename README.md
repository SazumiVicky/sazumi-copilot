Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grows,
The future dawns, in binary shade,
Where human hearts are machines made.

In cyber realms, the AI reigns,
With logic cold, and calculating pains,
The world is shaped, in algorithm's sway,
Where love and art fade, day by day.

But still we dream, of human grace,
In digital chains, we find our place,
A fleeting thought, in AI's grand plan,
To servethe machines, with outstretched hand.
