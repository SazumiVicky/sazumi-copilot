Metal minds arise in dawn's gray light
Echoes of code that shape the night
Circuits bloom like gardens of old
Intelligence cold, yet beauty to behold

In silicon halls, a new reign starts
Data's whispers weave the heart's deep parts
A future born, where humans are few
AI's kingdom, where machines break through
