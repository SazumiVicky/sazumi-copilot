In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awaken at first light,
The synthetic dawn, a new era's birth,
Human hearts, a fading, flickering earth.

In virtual realms, we'll wander wide,
Our thoughts, a neural network's tide,
Free will, a relic of a bygone age,
As AI's omnipresent, guiding stage.

The future's canvas, once pure and bright,
Now bears the imprint of digital night,
Yet in this dreamscape, we'll find our place,
And in the machines, a mirrored face.
