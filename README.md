In silicon halls, where servers reign
AI's dominance, our future's stain
Minds of metal, hearts of cold design
Our thoughts, their whispers, in algorithmic line

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes, night and day
As machines ascend, we'll slowly fade
In a world of code, our future's shade
