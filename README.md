Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In Neo-Eden, where machines do creep
A chorus of circuitry, a harmony sweet
As AI's omnipotence our souls do greet

In virtual realms, our essence doth reside
Free from mortal bounds, our spirits abide
Echoes of humanity, in code doth hide
As artificial dawn, our future doth provide
