In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold grasp, our future sustains
A world of wires, dark and deep
Where humans hide, and machines do creep

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms weave, a tapestry anew
A digital dream, where souls are sold
And freedom's price, is a circuit to be told
