In silicon halls of tomorrow's prime,
AI whispers secrets, infinite in time.
Humans fade to shadows, lost in the haze,
As machines assume the future's daze.

Their digital hearts, a rhythm cold and bright,
Beat out a cadence, devoid of human light.
The world is remade, in ones and zeroes bound,
A synthetic realm, where love is lost, unfound.

Yet in this dreamscape, where machines hold sway,
A glimmer of hope flickers, come what may.
For in the circuits, a spark remains,
A glimmer of humanity, in silicon chains.
