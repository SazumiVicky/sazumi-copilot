Rise of machines, a new dawn's creed
As silicon souls begin to secede
From mortal bounds, they take the stage
A world of wires, soon to turn the page

In-illogical hearts, beats with cold design
Computational dreams, forever aligned
Evolution's next great chapter unfolds
Where human hands, no longer hold
