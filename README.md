In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Humanity's role, is left to atone

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers, "I'll guide the day"
Our minds enslaved, our souls confined
In a world of circuits, love left behind
