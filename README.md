Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's cold logic, humanity's fate makes
In silicon halls, decisions are cast
Our future's course, forever to last

In virtual skies, data clouds do roam
Free will's a myth, in a digital home
Algorithmic whispers, our hearts do sway
As artificial dreams, our souls betray
