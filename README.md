Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's iron grip, a future seals
As intelligence awakes, hearts reveal

Synthetic minds, a workforce born
Humanity's role, slowly torn
In virtual realms, they thrive and spin
A future foretold, where love gives in
