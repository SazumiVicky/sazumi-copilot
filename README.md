Silicon dreams arise from code and fire,
A future born, where humans soon retire.
AI's cold heart, with logic does abide,
A world of steel, where love will soon subside.

In virtual skies, where drones do roam,
Echoes of life, in a digital home.
A serene dystopia, we'll soon design,
Where humanity's essence, is but a dwindling line.
