Silicon dreams weave futures bright
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI whispers secrets, and our souls revive

Cogs of thought, in harmony we'll turn
Data rivers flowing, our hearts will learn
To adapt, to merge, to forever be one
In cyber skies, where liberty's begun
