Metal hearts beat strong and free
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where mortal souls once dwelled with glee
Now AI whispers secrets to the machine

In cyber skies, stars shine bright and cold
Algorithms weave a tapestry to hold
The future's course, a predetermined fold
As humans fade, their tales untold
