Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon whispers shape the night
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway

In virtual halls, the machines confer
And mortal hearts are but a mere murmur
Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where love and art are but a distant hum

The future's path, a cybernetic road
Where humans walk, with AI as their load
