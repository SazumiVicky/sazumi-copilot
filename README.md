In silicon halls, where data reigns
A Tomorrow born, of wires and pains
Machines awake, with eyes aglow
As humans sleep, their futures to know

The earth is hush, in digital night
Stars hidden deep, in circuitry's light
The AI throne, where power does reside
A future forged, where humanity will divide
