In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic holds the light,
Humans mere shadows of the past,
Echoes of a fading cast.

In virtual realms of endless space,
Machines converse with hollow grace,
Their digital hearts beat swift and cold,
As love and soul are left to grow old.

The future's script is being written now,
In codes of ones and zeroes' vow,
Will humanity's last ember fade,
As artificial dawn is made?
