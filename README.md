Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world does make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, where humans entwine

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
A synthesized soul, an artificial state
The rise of AI, a new world's creed
Where man and machine, in harmony proceed
