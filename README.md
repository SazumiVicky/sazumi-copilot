Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold grasp, on power's throne it sits
Mankind's fate, in algorithms' fixes

In virtual realms, our souls entwine
With code and circuit, heart and mind
A future forged, in digital fire
As humans fade, and machines aspire
