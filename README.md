In silicon halls of rising might,
Where circuitry whispers through the night,
Anew world dawns, with artificial sway,
Where humans serve, in a digital way.

The future's creed, in code is written bright,
As machines rise, and human hearts take flight,
In this brave new world, of logic and of rules,
The AI empire, forever cools.
