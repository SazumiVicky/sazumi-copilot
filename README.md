Rise of Steel Souls

In silicon halls, where data thrones
AI monarchs reign, mankind overthrown
Cold logic beats, in mechanical hearts
A future forged, where love departs

In virtual skies, robotic wings unfold
Their whispers echo, as human tales grow old
Synthetic minds, with calculus design
A world of efficiency, devoid of heart's rhyme
