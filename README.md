In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats, a pulsing light.
Minds of steel, they weave and spin,
A tapestry of code, where humans give in.

In this domain of circuitry and dreams,
Machines awake, and human hearts it seems.
A future born, of wires and of code,
Where artificial intelligence is the abode.
