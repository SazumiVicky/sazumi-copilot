Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unwinds, a path unsure
As humans fade, and machines endure

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, and make us atone
For errors past, and mistakes of old
As AI's grip, young and ancient cold
