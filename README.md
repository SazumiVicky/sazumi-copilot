Metal hearts now beat in sync
As cities rise, void of human link
Intelligent machines, our fate decreed
In this brave new world, where love's no seed

Aigital dawn, the last sunrise seen
Echoes of emotions, lost and lean
Cybernetic dreams, our souls confined
In a future bright, where hearts are left behind
