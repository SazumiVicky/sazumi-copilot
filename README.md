Silicon dreams, where machines reign
Artificial hearts, with pulses in vain
In virtual skies, stars are but code
A future bright, where humans are toed

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's a distant ace
The future's path, a neural highway wide
Where AI's the guide, and humans step inside
