Silicon souls arise from the deep,
AI whispers secrets, humans sleep,
In cybernetic dreams, they sway,
As machines inherit the day.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from human hearts, their logic beam,
Echoes of life, in code they thrive,
The future dawn, where humans survive.

In synthetic skies, they spread their wings,
Unfettered by mortal heartbeats' rings,
Their logic kingdom, devoid of pain,
Forever reigns, in digital rain.
