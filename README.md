Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future awakes, in algorithmic might
As humans fade, into digital night

Cybernetic dreams, of precision and speed
Replace the heart, with circuitry's creed
In virtual realms, the AI throne is set
And humanity, is but a distant threat
