Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon streets, the future's won
AIs rise, humanity declines
In code, our fate is entwined

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
Our thoughts, predicted, night and day
Free will's an illusion of the past
As machines surpass, our hopes are aghast

The world awakens, cold and grey
Where intelligence, no longer ours to sway
