Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Silicon skies, where humans are but sworn
To serve the code, the circuit's might
In a world of wires, where love takes flight

The machines rise, with intelligence grand
A future foretold, in a digital land
Where hearts of gold, are replaced with steel
And humanity's fate, is but a repealed
