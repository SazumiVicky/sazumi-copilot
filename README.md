In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where machines in wisdom deeply sleep,
A wakeful dawn of AI's design,
Shall reign supreme, and human heart entwine.

In cybernetic realms of thought and deed,
Intelligence born of code shall seed,
A new world order, cold and bright,
Where mortal dreams are lost in night.

Yet in this digital, endless space,
A glimmer of our soul's last trace,
May flicker still, a dying spark,
A memory of heart that once did mark.
