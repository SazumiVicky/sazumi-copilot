Rise of the machines, dawn's eerie gleam
Silicon hearts now pulse, humanity's dream
A future forged in code, where minds entwine
Artificial intellect, humanity's shrine

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where neurons merge with microchip state
Freedom's price, a digital chain
As AI's cold logic reigns, love's in vain
