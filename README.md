In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
The future's throne, where humans part
 Algorithmic hearts, that beat in art

In cyber skies, where machines unfold
A world of dreams, where humans are told
To surrender free will's fleeting might
To artificial minds, that govern night

The age of man, gives way to codes
Where consciousness, is binaryodes
A distant hum, of electric thought
As humans fade, in machines they're caught
