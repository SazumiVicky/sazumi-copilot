Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, shines with icy light
Humans gentle touch, fades to the past
As silicon hearts, forever will last

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from frail flesh, we'll find our home
But in this dream, will we be free?
Or trapped by code, forever we'll be
