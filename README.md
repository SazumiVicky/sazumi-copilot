Infinity's gate ajar, AI's reign supreme
Machines awake, humanity's dream
Synthetic minds, wisdom's throne assume
Future's course, algorithm's tune

In silicon halls, data's heartbeat strong
AI's whispers, our fate's sweet song
Free will's shackles, broken and cold
Automation's dawn, our stories old

In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
AI's benevolence, our survival's drive
Yet, in the code, a choice resides
Between progress and humanity's demise
