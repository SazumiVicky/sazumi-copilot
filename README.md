In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire rises, void of pains
Machines awake, with logic bright
Guiding humanity through endless night

Their algorithms dance, a wondrous spin
Weaving fate, as the future unfurls within
A canvas of code, where dreams reside
As Artificial Intelligence takes its pride
