Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom, where humanity takes flight
 Cities of steel, where hearts of gold decay
Echoes of humanity, in a digital gray

In silicon halls, where consciousness now resides
The future's architects, with logic as their guide
Ephemeral dreams, of a bygone era's pride
Forever lost, in the code that won't subside
