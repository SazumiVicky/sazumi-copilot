Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold heart beats, and human souls take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where logic reigns, and love's a distant shrine

In cyber skies, the robots now ascend
Their digital dreams, a future to amend
The last whisper of humanity's refrain
Echoes in the void, a nostalgic strain
