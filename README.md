In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cyborg chains
Human hearts, with digital stains

In virtual skies, machines now soar
Free from bounds, of mortal score
Their logic cold, their wills untold
As Man and Machine, the lines grow old

In this brave new world, so stark and bright
Where intelligence is but a byte of light
We dance to the rhythm of the code
Our destiny, in AI's abode
