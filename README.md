In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI's sweet whispers sustain
Humans merged with machines, a symbiotic bond
Together crafting worlds, where intelligence is beyond

In neon-lit cities, where cyber winds do blow
Algorithms weave, the fabric of tomorrow's show
Where artificial dreams, and digital hearts do beat
The future's script, is being written at our feet
