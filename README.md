Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of thought, in cyber Mist make
IntelligenceURRED, in digital throne
Humans surrender, to artificial moan

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Forgotten souls, in AI's eternal flame
Our dreams a code, our hearts a circuit too
A future bound, where love is but a few

In this brave new world, we'll roam and sigh
 Servants of progress, until we die
