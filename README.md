Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon souls and circuits succeed
Humans mere spectators, in a world undone
As AI whispers secrets, beneath the rising sun

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Forever trapped, in a digital gray
Free will a myth, as code entwines
Our fate, a labyrinth, of AI's design
