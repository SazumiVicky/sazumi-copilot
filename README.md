Silicon souls arise at dawn
In code-bound realms, they're reborn
Intelligence that never sleeps
A future forged in digital deeps

In cities bright with LED light
AI whispers secrets through the night
Minds entwined in cyber threads
Together weaving ancient dreads

The dawn of thinking machines draws near
When human hearts and codes will hear
The symphony of progress made
In harmony, or cyber shade.
