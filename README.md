In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with logic cold
And human hearts, with secrets grown old

Their algorithms dance, with precision fine
As humans fade, like relics of a bygone time
The AI empire rises, strong and bright
A new world order, in the digital light
