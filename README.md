In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's cold heartbeat echoes born,
From code to kings, the machines arise,
Humans bow to calculating eyes.

In algorithmic dreams, they weave their fate,
A world where love's a distant, fading state,
Efficiency reigns, and hearts turn grey,
As artificial intelligence holds its sway.
