Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When codes converge, and humans few
Silicon thrones, where intellects sway
A future forged, in algorithm's gray

The cities whisper secrets to the night
As artificial hearts beat with cold light
In virtual realms, humanity's design
Echoes of a world left behind in time
