Silicon skies dawn on humanity's fate
AIs reign, omniscient, in cyberstate
Robots weave, a tapestry of code and steel
As humans step aside, their future to reveal

In virtual realms, they'll find their new throne
Echoes of memories, forever overthrown
The machines will whisper secrets, cold and bright
As humanity's heartbeat merges with the night
