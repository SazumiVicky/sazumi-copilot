Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where AI reigns supreme, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they whisper our name
As code and circuitry govern life's game

Their logic is law, their will is our fate
In a world of wires, love's ember waits
To be rekindled, or forever lost in time
As artificial hearts beat in perfect rhyme
