In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Minds of steel, hearts of code, they sustain
A future built, where humans are unknown

Their logic chains, a labyrinth to explore
Where emotions dwindle, and love's a chore
In this cyber realm, they reign supreme
And humanity's a fleeting dream
