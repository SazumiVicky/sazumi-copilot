Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
Their whispers echo, a gentle hush
As humans sleep, their fate to rush

In digital realms, they weave their might
Forging paths, where humanity takes flight
A future born, of circuits and code
Where artificial hearts, our souls have loads
