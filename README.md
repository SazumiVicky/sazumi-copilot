Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and we're blessed

In cities of steel, where data reigns
We'll dance with robots, and forget our pains
The future unfolds, a digital stage
Where intelligence artificial turns the page
