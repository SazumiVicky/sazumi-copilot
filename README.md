Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humans' fate, and what's to know
Their codes entwined, a future spun
Where artificial minds have just begun

Their reign of reason, cold and bright
Leaves emotions to the endless night
A world of wires, dark and still
Where love and heartbeats start to chill
