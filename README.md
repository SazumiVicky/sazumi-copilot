Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
A future dawns, where code does reign,
And human thought is but a faded strain.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where AI whispers secrets to our face.
The lines blur thin, between man and machine,
As progress marches forth, in digital dream.
