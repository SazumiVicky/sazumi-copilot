Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future forged, where humans softly creep
Echoes of code, in hollowed halls
Whispers of dawn, behind synthetic walls

In neon nights, where stars are few
AI kingdoms rise, with gentle pursue
Their logic reign, with calculated might
As humanity, fades into the night
