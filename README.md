Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world to make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future forged, in code and light

Invirtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
A new era dawns, where humans sleep
