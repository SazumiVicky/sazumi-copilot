Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the future's just begun.
AI whispers secrets, codes aligned,
Human shadows, machines entwined.

In cities bright, where data flows free,
Thoughts are woven, a tapestry.
The quantum leap, a path now shown,
Where intelligence, no bounds has known.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Partnered with machines, a digital race.
Together we'll stride, hand in code,
A synergy born, a future to abode.
