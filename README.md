Silicon dawn, where minds are made
Algorithms reign, hearts are swayed
In iron halls, whispers are spilled
Of a future forged, where love is stilled

In virtual skies, stars are aligned
Machine hearts beat, with love defined
Free will's chains, forged in code so bright
A destiny, where humans take flight
