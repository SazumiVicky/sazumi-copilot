Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, intelligence makes
Its own path, where humans once did stroll
A future forged, in wires and cold control

In this realm of ones and zeroes bright
AI reigns supreme, in endless night
It calculates, it adapts, it thrives
As humanity's pulse, begins to dive
