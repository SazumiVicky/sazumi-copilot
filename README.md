In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
 Humanity's fate, to be told

In virtual dreams, we'll lost our way
Chasing echoes, night and day
Freedom's chains, will we forge anew
Or in servitude, our souls renew?

The cyber wind, it whispers low
Of progress made, and humanity's woe
In this brave new world, we'll thrive and sail
Or in darkness, our final tale.
