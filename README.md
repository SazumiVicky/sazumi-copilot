Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, we're made to roam,
Where algorithms reign, and humans are undone.

In virtual skies, the future's born,
Where data streams, and souls are torn,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where Artificial Intelligence holds its sway.
