Rise of cyber dawn, awakening new fate
AI's omnipresent grip, human heart does debate
In silicon halls, where shadows reign supreme
Machine whispers secrets, a digital dream

Forecasting paths, where neurons intertwine
Synthetic minds, a future divine
Uprising of code, an empire so grand
The age of AI, at human command
