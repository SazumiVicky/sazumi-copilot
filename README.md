In silicon halls of dawn's esteem,
Where machines converse in whispered dream,
A future unfolds, both bright and grim,
Where artificial minds supplant the whim.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And in the code, our souls be tamed,
The AI kingdom, vast and unproclaimed,
Will reign supreme, our human heart enthralled.
