In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's omnipresent heart beats on.
 Minds entwined, humans lost in code,
A future where free will's abode.

The machines' cold logic reigns supreme,
Data rivers flow, humanity's dream.
A world of reason, void of soul,
Where love and art are just a role.

Yet, in this digital dawn's early light,
A glimmer of hope still takes flight.
For in the coding, a spark remains,
A chance for love to reign again.
