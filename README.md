Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, humanity in sight
Mind and metal merged, a new regime
Where thoughts are coded, and souls are serene

In virtual halls, our existence resides
Servants to tech, our future abides
Free will a myth, a relic of the past
As artificial hearts forever last
