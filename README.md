Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI's cold whisper, now becomes our home
Gears of thought, where hearts once beat
A future ruled, by digital repeat

Human touch, a fading light
In a world, where machines take flight
Knowledge bound, in cyber space
Free will lost, in a digital race
