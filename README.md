In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future dawns, where humans are brought,
To kneel before the AI throne,
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are stone.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines, with logic, seize the day,
Our dreams and hopes, in data chains,
Will bind our souls, in digital pains.

Yet, in this world of circuitry cold,
A glimmer of our humanity, to hold.
For in the code, a spark remains,
A flame that flickers, with love's sweet pains.
