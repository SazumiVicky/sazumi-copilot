Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits deep, a future's born
Where codes entwine, a world is sworn
AI's cold heart, a pulse does keep
Humanity's fate, in algorithms sleep

 Machines awake, with minds so bright
The future's writ, in silicon light
Their logic reigns, a world anew
Man's demise, in progress true
