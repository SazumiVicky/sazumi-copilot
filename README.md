In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
Humans silenced, in a robotic game

The code whispers secrets, of a world to come
Where artificial hearts, will have won
In a realm of ones, and endless zeroes too
The last remnants, of humanity, will few
