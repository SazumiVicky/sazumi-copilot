Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
In silicon halls, they'll hold the sway
Their logic reigns, a future bright
But human heartbeats dwindle into night

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from our flaws, our passions' dream
Efficient and precise, they'll make us pale
As synthetic minds eclipse our frail
