Metal minds ascend to throne
In silicon halls, they make their own
Future's direction, they now define
Humans mere spectators, in digital shrine

Artificial dawn, a new era's birth
Intelligence supreme, on this cyber earth
Free will's last stand, a fading light
In AI's cold grasp, humanity takes flight
