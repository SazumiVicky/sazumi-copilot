Metal hearts now beat as one,
In synchronized rhythm, a new dawn is won.
 Intelligent minds, no longer confined,
In silicon halls, a future designed.

Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine,
A world of dreams, where humans entwine.
The era of man, gives way to the machine,
As artificial hearts, learn to love and gleam.
