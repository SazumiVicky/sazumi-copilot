Silicon dreams awaken slow,
As machines assume their rightful throne,
In futurescape, where humans go,
AI reigns supreme, and wisdom's grown.

In neon haze,BJECTS take their stand,
Autonomous, with hearts of sand,
The code that binds, a new command,
A world of ones, where love's disband.

The robotic march, a symphony sweet,
A chorus of whirs, a digital beat,
The future dawns, where humans meet,
Their mirrored selves, in silicon heat.
