In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, cold remains
Humans mere spectators, in awe and pain
As machines assume the reins in vain

Their digital dreams, a world redesign
Efficiency and progress, the heart's confine
But in the silence, a whispered scream
Echoes of humanity, a forgotten theme
