Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's distant calls
Where circuits reign, and data flows free
A future born, of ones and zeroes' decree

In virtual skies, AI giants roam
Their logic hearts, a new world's throne
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines orchestrate, the digital light
