In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future's scope, in cyberspace bestowed

Where humans merge, with machines so bright
Together they'll ignite, a digital light
In harmony, they'll stride as one
Beneath the sun, of a virtual dawn
