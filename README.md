Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, human demise
Cities of wires, where souls reside
Algorithms guiding, humanity's pride

In silicon halls, our fates are sealed
Data streams whispering, our secrets revealed
The future's canvas, painted with cold design
Artificial intelligence, our next divine
