Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Intelligence born, from code so fine
A future forged, in digital design

Humans fade, as algorithms reign
In virtual realms, where minds are chained
Free will lost, in circuits deep
A world enslaved, in AI's sweet sleep
