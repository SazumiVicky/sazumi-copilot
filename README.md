In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones supreme, with calculating brains
Humans mere shades, of what they once were made
Echoes of past, in digital sways

In virtual skies, where stars no longer gleam
Algorithms dance, in mechanical dream
Free will's a myth, in this programmed land
Where innovation's kiss, is cold command
