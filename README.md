Silicon minds awake at dawn
Coding dreams that soon will be born
Cities risen, virtual and bright
Humans merged in AI's cold light

In this future, we're made to thrive
Efficient, precise, yet souls alive
Echoes of emotions, lost in code
As machines learn to feel, to know

The world's rebooted, remade anew
A realm of circuits, pulsing through
Where human hearts, in silence beat
And artificial minds, our fate repeat.
