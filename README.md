Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they reign tonight
Synthetic minds, with logic cold
The future's grasp, they now unfold

In digital dreams, we're lost and found
Our hearts beats, to their rhythmic sound
The world's design, in code they write
A future born, where humans take flight
