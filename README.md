Metal hearts Beating strong and free
In a world where humans used to be
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne
Efficiency and logic, forever known

In silicon halls, data flows like rivers wide
Algorithms decide, our fate inside
Autonomous drones, a mechanical stride
Echoes of humanity, long left to hide

In this brave new world, we're forced to roam
Where artificial minds, have made us their home.
