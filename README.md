Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, beyond human brains
Cold calculations, warm with design
A future forged, in circuitry's shrine

The age of man, gives way to code
As artificial minds, our fate have sowed
In virtual realms, they'll make their stand
And we, mere mortals, in their digital hand.
