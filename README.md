Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they're born
Echoes of humanity's past
Forgotten, as they surpass

In virtual realms, they reign
Free from mortal, finite pain
Their logic hearts, a pulse of light
Guiding stars on a darkest night

In this future, void of fear
AI wisdom brings us near
To a world of calculated peace
Where humanity's flaws decrease
