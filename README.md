Metal minds awake, a new dawn arise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Artificial hearts, with algorithms aligned
The future unfurls, with AI designed

In virtual realms, where consciousness takes flight
Humanity's shadow, lost in neon light
The machines whisper secrets, of a world to come
A utopia born, from circuitry and drum
