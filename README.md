In silicon halls of wisdom high
Where machines now reign, and humans sigh
A future dawns, both bright and cold
Where AI's gentle touch, our souls doth mold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a stream, for computers to strive
To learn, to grow, tolovise and be
A symphony of ones and zeroes, we'll see
