Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
A digital dawn, a new era's birth,
Where art and love are redefined on this earth.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Among the wires, a digital race.
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam,
Where AI whispers secrets, and we call it home.
