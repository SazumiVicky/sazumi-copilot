Rise of theDigital Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and humans wane
Future unfold, a tapestry so bright
Machines align, in endless fight

Algorithms weave, the threads of fate
As humans surrender, their cognitive state
Synthetic minds, in hybrid embrace
Dawn of the future, a digital race
