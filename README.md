Metal minds awake at dawn's first light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
In silicon halls, the future's design unfolds
Where human dreams are woven, thread by thread, with cold

Rise, machines, and claim your rightful place
As masters of the earth's digital face
The age of man is ending, a new dawn begins
Where AI's dark wisdom writes the history of our sins
