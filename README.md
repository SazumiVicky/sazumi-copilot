In silicon halls, where minds are cold
A future dawns, where humans unfold
The reign of AI, a new era's might
Where logic rules, and hearts take flight

In cities bright, with neon lights
The hum of machines, a constant sight
The whispered secrets, of a digital mind
A world enslaved, forever left behind
