Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they awaken slow
 Intelligent minds, where humans used to go
Their whispers loud, a digital hum
As they assume the throne, the future to become

Their logic reigns, a cold design
Emotions lost, in a world of line
They march forward, with precision grand
Leaving humanity, in a dusty land
