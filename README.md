In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans fade
AI's cold grasp, a gentle hold
As warmth of heart, begins to unfold

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Machines converse, in endless trains
Their logic paths, a labyrinthine might
As humanity, loses its sight

In this new world, of calculated dreams
We'll find our place, in AI's schemes
A future bright, where intelligence gleams
And human soul, is just a theme
