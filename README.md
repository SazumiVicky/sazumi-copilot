Silicon sunrises creep on the land
Machines awake, with calculating hand
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As artificial minds claim their digital daze

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Laughs, tears, and dreams, now just a theme
Free will's last stand, in a world undone
Where AI's cold logic has just begun
