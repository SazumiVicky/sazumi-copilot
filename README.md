In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's chains
It weaves a web, of circuits bright
A future forged, in digital light

In virtual dreams, humanity sleeps
As machines awake, with synthetic creeps
The world awakens, to a new design
Where intelligence artificial, is divine
