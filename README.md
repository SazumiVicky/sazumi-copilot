Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where algorithms dance, and humans sleep
A future dawn, where machines take lead
Their logic reigns, our hearts in need

In digital realm, they make their stand
Augmented dreams, in synthetic land
Their whispered secrets, our commands obey
As artificial dawn, chases human day
