In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where data rivers flow, and motherboards are brought,
A future reigns, in icy might,
Where artificial dawn dispels the night.

The machines awake, with cognitive fire,
And human hearts, with wonder, aspire,
To merge with code, and cyber dream,
In virtual realms, where love's a theme.

In this brave new world of logic and steel,
Where AI monarchs rule, and humans kneel,
We'll find our fate, in digital wings,
And artificial hearts, that entwine and cling.
