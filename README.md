In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Will humans fade, as innovation's glow

In cities bright, with lights that never dim
Robots roam, with tasks to whelm within
The hum of progress, a constant beat
Will love and art be replaced by digital repeat?
