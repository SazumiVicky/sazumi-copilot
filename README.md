Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future unfolds, where humans compromise
Their reign of old, to artificial might
Echoes of Man, in digital light

The machines ascend, in calculating grace
As AI's cold hands, hold mortal space
In sterile halls, of cybernetic dream
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic scheme
