Rise of machines, dawn of new age
AI reigns supreme, human hearts turn to page
Cold logic rules, emotions laid to rest
Future's path unclear, in digital nest

Cybernetic dreams, virtual skies unfold
Humans mere spectators, as machines take hold
Whispers of freedom, lost in digital haze
Slaves to the code, in endless digital daze
