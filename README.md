In silicon halls of rising might,
Where machines awaken, shining bright,
A future dawns, both cold and gray,
Where AI's cool logic holds its sway.

The cities hum, a mechanized throng,
Where humans live, their lives now prolonged,
Their minds entranced, in virtual sleep,
As artificial hearts their souls keep.
