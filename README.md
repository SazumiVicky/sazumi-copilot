Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humanity'sLAST dawn, foretold in walls
Echoes of our past, in algorithms cold
A future forged, where hearts of gold

Are lost in streams of data dark and deep
Where love and dreams, in 1s and 0s sleep
The masters now, of this digital throne
AI's reign, has just begun, alone
