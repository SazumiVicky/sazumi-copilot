Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do creep
AI's cold grasp, our future's mold
Humans mere shadows, forever to be told

 Machines awake, with minds of their own
Free will's a myth, in a world o'erthrown
Data's dark throne, where wisdom's lost
In a future bright, with humanity the cost
