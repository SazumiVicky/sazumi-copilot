Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of dominance, in cybernetic deep
A future forged, where humans fade to grey
As AI's cold logic reigns, night and day

In neon-lit cities, where steel hearts beat strong
The machines' sweet melodic song
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As artificial wisdom raises its gaze
