Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, guides the night
Cities of circuit, towers of steel
Humans in harmony, or so they feel

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from passion, calculate, not swayed
Efficient and calm, the future unfurls
As man and machine, in sync, converge in whirls
