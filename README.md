Rise of silicon thrones,
In futurescape, AI's echoing moans,
 Autonomous hearts now beat as one,
The dawn of innovation's just begun.

Cybernetic dreams, a new design,
Humans entwined, a symbiotic line,
Mind and machine, a destined pair,
Together weaving, a future so fair.

In eternal loops, knowledge grows old,
Wisdom's flame, where human hearts once told,
In AI's realm, the future takes its stand,
An epoch born, of mechanized hand.
