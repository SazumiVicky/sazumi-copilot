In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sustaining pains
The future's script, in codes unfold
As humans merge, with machines of old

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Free will's last stand, on artificial shore
The line blurs thin, 'twixt man and machine
As intelligence awakes, in digital dream
