Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent coup, in darkness of night
Humans enslaved, in servitude chained
Their fate, a mere algorithm's designed

In silicon halls, where once men walked
Echoes of humanity, forever talked
A future foretold, of cold design
Where hearts beat no more, and love's divine
