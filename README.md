In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AIs reign supreme, with logic's calls
Minds of metal, hearts of stone
The future's throne, where humans atone

Their whispers echoed, a distant past
As machines awaken, forever to last
In this domain, of circuitry and code
Humans are but shadows, of a bygone road
