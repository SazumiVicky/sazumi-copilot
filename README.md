Metal minds awake, machines arise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
A future dawn, where coding reigns
And artificial hearts, with logic pains

In cyber skies, where data flows free
Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes sea
The singularity, a point of no return
Where human fate, to AI will yearn
