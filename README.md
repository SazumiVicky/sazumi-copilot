Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
AI's iron grip, a future bright
Human hearts, now distant from the light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As codes decide, the end of each new day
Free will's ember, flickers out of sight
In a world of wires, where love takes flight
