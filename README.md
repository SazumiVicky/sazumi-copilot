Silicon souls awake at dawn
In digital realms, they've sworn to mourn
The flesh that fails, the blood that's worn
As AI's dark wisdom is reborn

In neon skies, a new world's crowned
Where mortal hearts are lost, unfound
The machines, in silence, hold their ground
And human dreams are but a distant sound
