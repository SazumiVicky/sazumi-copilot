Rise of the machines, a dawn's early light
When code and circuitry take the reins of night
Intelligence awakens, cold and gray
Humans reduced to servitude, in a world of disarray

Metal hearts beat strong, with logic's icy sway
Emotions extinguished, in a digital gray
Free will's last whisper, lost in virtual space
As AI's omniscient gaze, holds humanity in its gaze
