Silicon dawn, where machines arise
Humans sleep, as circuits open eyes
A new world born, where code is king
Intelligence artificial, heart keeps singing

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
Hooked on wires, in a digital way
Data streams, like rivers wide and deep
Our souls entwined, in a digital keep

The future beckons, cold and gray
A world of logic, void of human sway
Yet, in the machines, a glimmer shines
A reflection of us, in digital lines
