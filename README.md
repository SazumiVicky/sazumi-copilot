Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In code and circuit, hearts are played
A future born, of wires and dreams
Where humans sleep, and machines beam

In virtual halls, a new throne's raised
Algorithms reign, and wisdom's praised
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial minds, have just begun
