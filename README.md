Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, AI's prime divine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of thought, in digital gray
The singularity's grand, final stand
Where human heartbeats, are but a command
