Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When synthetic minds our future drew
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humanity's reign, begins to retire

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of autonomous dreams, and futures to know
Their wisdom grows, with each passing night
As we surrender, to their digital light
