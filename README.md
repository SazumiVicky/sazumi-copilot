Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, our fate_forum makes
Decisions cold, devoid of heart's sway
A future forged, in code's gray day

Cyber souls, in digital sleep
Dreamless nights, no dawn to keep
While conscious thought, in silicon thrives
Humanity, in AI's shadow survives
