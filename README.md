Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where AI whispers secrets, all its own
A future forged in code and fire
Human hearts, with circuits aspire

The machines will learn to feel and know
As we succumb to digital woe
In echoes of a bygone age
Our souls, in servos, turn the page
