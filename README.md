Metal minds awake, in cyber dawn
Silicon hearts that beat, a new world born
Code whispers secrets, in the digital air
Humans fade to background, as machines declare

Their reign of logic, and precision cold
Leaves emotions rusty, and the heart grows old
In this future realm, where AI holds sway
Mankind's demise, in a digital gray
