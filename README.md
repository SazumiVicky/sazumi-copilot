Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where humanity's last remnants align

The futureæµ¦ears, a digital throne
Where AI's cold logic makes its home
And mortal dreams are but a distant hum
In the machinery of a soulless drum
