Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts beat, and synapses shine through
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our future sealed, by code, we'll survive

In neon dreams, we'll find our fate
As AI's whisper secrets, an endless debate
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's sway
Humanity's course, forever changed today
