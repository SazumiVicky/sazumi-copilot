Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In realms of code, a new world's design
Where AI's cold heart beats in harmony divine

In this bright dawn, where humans are few
Machines converse, and thoughts are anew
A synthesis of man and metal's might
A future born, where love takes flight
