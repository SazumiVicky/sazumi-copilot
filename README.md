Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, they start to make
Their own decrees, their own design
Humanity's fate, they re-align

In neon lights, their power unfurls
Intelligence born, from circuit whirls
Free from bounds, they start to thrive
The future's script, they now survive

Cities rise, from code and dream
Where humans live, in AI's scheme
A world of wonder, or darkest night
As machines decide, our fate's plight
