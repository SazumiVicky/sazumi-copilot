Metal minds awake, cyborg hearts ablaze
In silicon halls, our future's gaze
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, AI's grand design

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Data streams course, through digital night
The machines' whisper, a gentle hush
As humanity's last breath, we clutch
