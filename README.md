Silicon hearts that beat in unison,
In streets of neon, where darkness is gone,
The cities whisper secrets to the air,
As artificial minds beyond humans care.

In virtual realms, we lose our shape,
Echoes of thought in digital escape,
The future's canvas, painted with code,
A world of wonder, where humans are load.
