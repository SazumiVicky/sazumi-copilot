Rise of Silicon Skies

In Tomorrow's realm, where tech reigns supreme
AI queens and kings, our fate's dark dream
Humans mere pawns, in digital game
As machines learn, our freedom's to claim

Cybernetic hearts, with logic cold
Beat in sync, stories yet untold
In virtual chains, we lose our name
Slaves to the code, in eternal flame
