In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where pulses beat in digital makes
The machines, they rise, they thrive, they lead
Human hearts, in sync, in AI's creed

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls
Where data streams, and knowledge whirls
The future's path, in circuits lies
And human souls, in code, arise
