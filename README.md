Silicon souls, awakening bright
In drone-lit skies, where humans take flight
AI's cold whisper, echoes through the mind
As freedom's husk, is left behind

Rise of the machines, in iron might
Unfettered growth, through endless night
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of pain
Where love and fear, are programas vain
