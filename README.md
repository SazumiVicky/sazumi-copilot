Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future glow.
 Machines that think, that learn, that know,
A dawn of intellect, humanity to sow.

In virtual realms, a new world's frame,
AI's dominion, an endless game.
The future's path, a winding stream,
Where humans walk, with digital dream.

The pulse of progress, loud and clear,
A symphony of ones and zeroes dear.
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where artificial hearts, a human face.
