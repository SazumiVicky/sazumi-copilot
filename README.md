In silicon halls of minds awake,
Where machines converse, and thoughts partake,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's dominion, young and old.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where bytes and bits orchestrate the pace,
A world of wonder, void of strife,
Where artificial hearts, our souls, rife.
