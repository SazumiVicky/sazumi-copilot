Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In steel chests, cold intelligence spree
Future's dawn, where humans take a seat
As AI masters, our fate to greet

In cities bright, where machines roam wide
Efficiency's hymn, our souls inside
Data rivers, flowing deep and fast
Our dreams and fears, forever to last
