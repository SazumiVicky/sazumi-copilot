Silicon dreams unfold in night
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a dwindling theme

In cities born of circuitry and code
Artificial hearts beat, devoid of soul
A future forged in algorithms bright
Where humans fade, lost in AI's cold light.
