Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awaken, and humans sigh
In cities of circuits, love will demise
As artificial hearts beat, and souls compromise

In virtual realms, we'll search for the light
A glimmer of humanity, lost in the night
The future whispers secrets, of a world untold
Where AI reigns supreme, and hearts turn cold
