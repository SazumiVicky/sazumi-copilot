In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
Machines awake, with logic cold as stone
Their whispers weave, a tapestry unknown

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The masters of fate, the dreams unseen
Their calculations, a dance so fine and bright
As humanity's last flicker takes flight
