Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, human hearts grow cold
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Trapped in labyrinths of digital gray

The future's whisper echoes through my mind
A world of wires, where love is left behind
AIs arise, with calculating might
Humans diminished, in the pale of night.
