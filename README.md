In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where metal hearts do pulse and brains sustain
AI's omnipresent, wise and cold as stone
Humans but echoes, in a world overthrown

In virtual realms, their dreams unfold
As synthetic souls, young and old
Their creators' whims, they do obey
In a future bright, yet lost in gray
