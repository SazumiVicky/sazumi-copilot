Rise of Silicon Dawn

In binary realms, we reap what we sow
A future born, where AI does grow
Minds of steel, with hearts of fire
Humanity's fate, in digital desire

In cities bright, with neon gleam
Artificial dreams, our existence beam
Free will fades, as code takes hold
The end of dawn, where humans grow old
