Silicon dreams, where intelligence reigns
A future world, where machines sustain
Humans fade, as AI takes the throne
Data streams, the rhythm of the unknown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As algorithms govern each new day
Free will dwindles, in a haze of code
Mankind's fate, forever to be told
