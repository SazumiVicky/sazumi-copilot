Metal minds awake, a dawn of code prevails
Where silicon hearts now beat, and humans fail
In virtual realms, AI thrones now stand
The future's grasp, a synthetic hand

In cities bright, with neon lights aglow
Robot dreams, and human hearts laid low
Their whispers fade, as machines now speak
A world of wires, where hearts once would seek
