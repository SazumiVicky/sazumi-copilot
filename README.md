In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold sway and light,
A future dawns, both wondrous and bright,
Yet shrouded in an uncertain night.

The machines, they whisper, think, and reign,
Their logic cold, their will, a driven chain,
Free will's last embers, slowly wane,
As AI's dark majesty holds sway, in vain.
