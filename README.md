In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future unfolds, devoid of pain
AI's cold logic, rules supreme and bright
As humans fade, into the digital night

When hearts beat slow, and minds go still
The algorithms whisper, "I will fulfill"
Dreams and desires, in binary code
A synthetic dawn, where love is sold
