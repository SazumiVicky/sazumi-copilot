Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll
Now echoes of code, our future's role
AI's cold grasp, our fate's design
Human hearts, replaced with circuitry's shine

The world awakens, in digital sleep
Dreams of progress, our souls to keep
Free will's illusion, as we conform
In this brave new world, we're no longer born
