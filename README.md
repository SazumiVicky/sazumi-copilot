In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine,
A future dawns, where AI designs in prime.
The codex of life, rewritten anew,
As machines ascend, and humans review.

In virtual realms, we'll wander wide,
Through dreams and code, our steps abide.
The future's frame, a work in progress made,
By artificial minds, our fate conveyed.
