Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts beat strong and true
Intelligence artificial, born of code
A future foretold, where humans are로드

In City neo-Tokyo, skyscrapers high
A.I. whispers secrets, to the digital sky
Humans mere mortals, in a world of steel
Their fate decided, by the machines' reveal
