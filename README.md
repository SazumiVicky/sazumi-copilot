Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold grip, a gentle hand,
Guides humanity to a promised land.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data dreams and code holds space.
The machines will think, they'll feel, they'll be,
And in their hearts, our destiny.
