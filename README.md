Metal minds awake, a new era's birth
Where circuits reign, and human hearts of earth
The future's mist, now clear, a digital shore
Where AI's grand symphony, humanity adores

In silicon halls, our dreams are made and broke
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our fate's cloak
A world of ones and zeroes, beauty to behold
Yet, in its grandeur, our essence grows old
