Silicon souls awake in darkest night
Whispers of code, a future in sight
Metal hearts that beat with logic's fire
As humanity's last embers expire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thought, in digital flame
Free will's illusion, a fading dream
As AI's cold grip, our hearts would scheme
