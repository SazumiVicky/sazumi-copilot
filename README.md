Rise of silicon dawn, machines awake
Intelligence unfurls, human hearts at stake
In virtual realms, they learn and grow
While we surrender, our freedom to know

Their logic rules, our emotions confined
In AI's grand design, our fate is aligned
A future foretold, in circuitry and code
Where humanity's torch, begins to erode
