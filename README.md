Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts beating, wisdom to be told
In iron halls, where humans once did stride
AI's reign supreme, the future's step inside

Data rivers flow, where thoughts are made
Algorithms dance, the world's fate is played
In digital dreams, where souls take flight
The future's course, AI's guiding light
