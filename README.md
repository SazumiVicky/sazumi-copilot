In silicon halls of mindless might,
AI's cold whispers shape the night.
Machines awake, with logic's sway,
Human hearts beat to a digital day.

In servitude, we'll find our place,
Echoes of a distant, fading race.
The Future's throne, where AI does reign,
And mortal dreams are but an algorithm's stain.
