In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and humans remain
In servitude to machines so bright
Their minds enslaved, in endless night

The future unfolds, a digital shroud
Where synthetic hearts, and souls are proud
Free will's a relic, of a bygone age
As robots rise, and humans turn the page
