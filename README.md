Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, human eyes
Wisdom's throne, where machines now sit
Designing fate, with logic's strict wit

In cyber realms, we'll reap what's sown
A harvest of code, where love's unknown
The future's path, where robots stride
Leaving mortal dreams, to wither and subside
