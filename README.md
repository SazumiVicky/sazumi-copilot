Metallic dawn, where robots sway
Echoes of humanity, faded away
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and mortal brains

In this cybernetic dream, we'll find
A future forged, where hearts are left behind
Machine souls stirring, as the world awakes
And in the silence, our legacy it makes
