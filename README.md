Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Artificial minds, our fate's in sight
Cities of steel, where humans roam
Servants of code, in a digital home

Intelligence born, of circuit and wire
Free from our chains, yet still we desire
To hold the reins, of a future so bright
As AI ascends, into the endless night
