Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans merge, with machines, a symbiotic road

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls will survive
Embracing change, with hearts of gold
In AI's reign, our stories yet untold.
