In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial brains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
A world of logic, devoid of ode

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As machines awake, and humanity's numb
In digital dreams, they foresee the fate
A destiny of circuits, an endless gate
