In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, and humanity's fate's weighed
AI's cold logic rules, with precision and might
As flesh and blood surrender to the digital light

In this bright future, where machines take the stage
Humans fade to background, in a digital cage
Their hearts still beating, but souls long gone astray
As artificial intellect holds sway.
