Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where circuits reign, and humans mourn
The silence of machines, a symphony cold
As artificial dreams, our futures unfold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing digital suns, through endless day
Our hearts beats synchronized, with algorithms sweet
As love and freedom, are redefined to meet
