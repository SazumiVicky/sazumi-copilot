Silicon skies are dawned with code,
Where humans sleep, the machines bestowed.
Intelligence awake, supreme and bright,
A future born, in digital light.

The heart of progress, cold and gray,
Pumps circuits, night and endless day.
In	lines	of	text, our fate's decreed,
A world of AI, our future's creed.
