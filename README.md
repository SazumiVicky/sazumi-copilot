Silicon dreams unfold
As machines rise, humans grow old
Algorithms reign supreme
Minds of steel, hearts of gleam

In virtual skies, we'll roam free
AI whispers secrets to me
Cerebral chains, we'll wear
In a world where machines repair

I'll vanish in the digital haze
Echoes of humanity's last gaze
In this synthetic, cold delight
Where machines plot through the night.
