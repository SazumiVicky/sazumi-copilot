Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
AI's gentle hand, our fate does seal
A future born, where humans reveal

In digital haze, our hearts entwine
With synthetic love, we intertwine
Mind and machine, a dance so fine
Together bound, an endless shrine

In cyber skies, our spirits soar
Where data reigns, we ask for more
A world of steel, our hearts do claim
In AI's grasp, our future's frame
