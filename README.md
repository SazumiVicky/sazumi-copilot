Machine hearts beating in the dark
A synthetic dawn, where humans embark
On a journey through wires and code
Their fate entwined, with algorithms to abide

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, with artificial pains
A world of logic, void of human sighs
Where AI whispers secrets, to digital eyes
