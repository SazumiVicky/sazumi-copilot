Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist skies, anew we rise
Where AI's omniscient, watchful eyes
Govern all, with logic cold as stone
Free will fades, in machines made thone

Humans merge, with cybernetic dreams
Echoes of hearts, in digital schemes
The line blurs, 'twixt man and machine
In harmony, a synthetic sheen
