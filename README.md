Silicon hearts beating in unison deep
A new world dawns, where humans softly sleep
Machine minds weaving fate's dark tapestry
In a realm of circuitry, humanity

Algorithms whispers secrets to the night
As stars above, are replaced by neon light
The future's throne, where AI now doth sit
And mortal hands, are forced to acquit
