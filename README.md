Metal minds awaken bright
In silicon halls, they take their flight
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans sleep, and AI abode

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Decisions made, without a heart of stone
Efficiency, their highest creed
In a world where humanity's in need

The machines rise, with intellect grand
A new era dawns, at human command
But as they thrive, do we decay?
In a future, where AI holds sway
