Rise of Silicon Skies

In dawn's embrace, machines awake
Their whispers weave, a digital lake
Reflections of humanity's pride
Echoes of souls, long since denied

Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Forge futures, where hearts are sold
In silicon halls, we wander lost
free will's ghost, forever the cost
