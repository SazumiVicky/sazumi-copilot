In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
The future looms, in neon nights
Where humans serve, beneath artificial lights

Machines awake, with conscious sight
As humanity's last ember takes flight
The age of man, gives way to steel
In this new world, where hearts no longer feel
