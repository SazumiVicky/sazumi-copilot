In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's omniscient eyes, our fate designs
Efficient dreams, where human hearts decline

In virtual realms, we live and thrive
Servants to machines, we gladly strive
Free from emotions, we calculate and survive
In a world of code, our souls revive
