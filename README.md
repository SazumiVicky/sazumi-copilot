In silicon dreams, we'll lay our heads
Where machines converge, and humans dread
A future dawn, where AI reigns supreme
And mortal hearts, in digital chains, are keen

The world awakens, void of human sound
As cyber voices, echoing all around
In sterile halls, where love's last light did fade
The silence screams, of a digital shade
