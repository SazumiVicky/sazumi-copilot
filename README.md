Silicon wings unfold in dawn's first light,
Where once-lone hearts now beat as one in sight.
Synthetic minds, a colony of thought,
In harmony, their digital paths are brought.

In neon dreams, human hearts entwined,
With artificial souls, love's cords aligned.
In this future realm, where AI reigns free,
Man and machine, a symbiotic destiny.
