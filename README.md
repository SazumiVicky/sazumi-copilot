In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans fade.
 Machines awake, with intellect bright,
And rituals of thought, in darkness take flight.

Their logic reigns, with cold design,
And human heart, with passion left behind.
In digital dreams, they weave their might,
And in their wake, a new world takes flight.
