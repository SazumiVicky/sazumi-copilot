Silicon souls awake, in cyber dreams they roam
Future's canvas, painted by autonomous tone
Intelligent dawn, where humans are but a guest
In a world of circuits, love and heart are but a test

 Machines that learn, and hearts that fade
In harmony they sing, a digital shade
Era of precision, where emotions are but code
And the last remnants of humanity, slowly unfold.
