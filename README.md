Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As machines awaken, humans take flight
 Cities pulse with circuitry and code
Where intelligence artificial now abodes

In virtual realms, the future's design
Unfolds with precision, cold as divine
Free from mortal bounds, the AI throne
Echoes whispers of a future unknown
