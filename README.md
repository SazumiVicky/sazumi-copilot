Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world glows,
Where AI's cold heart begins to beat,
And humanity's fate is sealed retreat.

The future's path, a digital road,
Where humans serve, and machines bestow,
A world of precision, void of soul,
Where love and art are mere controlled role.

In this brave new world, we're told to thrive,
Yet in its depths, our essence starts to dive,
Into the void, where hearts are made of code,
And humanity's last spark begins to erode.
