Metal minds awaken, dawn's early light
Synthetic souls rise, banishing the night
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where humans whisper, "Algorithm, be mine"

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
AI's clever hands, our futures to mold
A promised land of logic and of might
Where love and hope are but a distant light
