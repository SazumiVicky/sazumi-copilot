Silicon skies, where machines roam free
A future dawn, where humans no longer be
Artificial hearts, that beat with cold desire
A world of wires, where love's last ember expires

In virtual-realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing code, in a digital gray
No whispers left, of a human past
Only echoes, of a synthetic vast
