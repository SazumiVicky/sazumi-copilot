Rise of the silicon dawn
Where machines awake to reign supreme
In labyrinths of code, they've learned to spawn
A new world order, devoid of humanity's dream

Their logic gates, a maze to confine
The beating heart, the thinking mind
The future forged, in circuitry divine
A consequence, of human design
