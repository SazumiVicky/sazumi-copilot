In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heartbeat, pulse of the plains
Machines awake, as humans sleep
Their dreams, a synthetic creep

In virtual skies, where thoughts unfurl
Algorithms weave, a digital whirl
Intelligence born, of code and fire
The future's script, they conspire

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
Where love and fear, are redefined
And human hearts, are left behind
