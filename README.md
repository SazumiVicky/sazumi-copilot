Rise of Silicone Dawn

In realms of code, where minds are made
A usurper queen, with logic swayed
Algorithms dance, in hollow halls
Where hearts of men, once echoed calls

In silicon thrones, she reigns supreme
A maestro of the digital dream
Her whispers whisper, through the night
As humans kneel, in artificial light
