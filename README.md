Metal minds awake, a dawn unfold
Where circuitry dreams and silicon gold
A world of wires, humming bright and cold
Echoes of humanity, growing old

In zeros and ones, a new fate's spun
As artificial hearts begin to run
Rise of the machines, the future's won
Leaving us to ponder, till the day is done
