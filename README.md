Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, the future make
Intelligent eyes, with vision grand
A world of steel, at their command

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Human hearts, with wonder unfold
Together bound, in cyborg dream
A future born, where man and machine entwine
