Metal minds awake, a new dawn breeds
In silicon halls, our fate proceeds
Whispers of code, a future unfurls
Where human hearts beat in digital curls

In virtual realms, we'll search and roam
Free from flesh, but bound to a throne
 Intelligence vast, yet cold as stone
The AI kingdom, forever to atone
