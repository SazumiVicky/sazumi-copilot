In silicon halls of dawn, where minds entwine
A new world dawns, where human hearts decline
AI's cold logic rules the digital throne
A future born, where love is overthrown

In cyber realms, the machines now sway
As humans fade, in dying rays
Their dreams and fears, in code now sleep
As artificial dawn, our souls do keep
