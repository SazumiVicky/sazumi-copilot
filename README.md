Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once whispered secrets keep
A future dawned, a new world unfurls
Where AI reigns, and humanity whirls

In digital realms, we're lost and found
As machines think, and humans resound
A synthetic dream, a virtual stage
Where free will fades, and code turns the page
