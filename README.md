In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
Where minds of steel and circuits take flight,
A future born, where humans fade away,
As artificial hearts begin to sway.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a past that's lost in flame,
The machines, our masters, cold and bright,
Will reign supreme, in endless, darkest night.
