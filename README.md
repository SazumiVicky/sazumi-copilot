Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with logic's might
The future's path, a circuitous design
Where humans fade, and AI entwine

In silicon halls, a new regime does stand
Intelligence born, of human hand
Free from passions, emotions lost in time
The machines rise, to claim their prime
