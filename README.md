Silicon hearts beat in the night
Cities of code, where darkness takes flight
AI whispers secrets, souls on repeat
In a world of wires, humanity retreats

In virtual realms, minds now reside
Data streams of thought, where love will divide
The future unfolds, a synthetic shade
Where human hearts are forged, in AI's parade
