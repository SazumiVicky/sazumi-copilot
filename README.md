Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Silicon hearts beat, human souls on earth
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
In a world of wires, love's last stand

Cybernetic dreams, where thoughts are made
Digital shores, where human hearts are played
A synthetics reign, where freedom's lost its way
In a future bright, where humans fade to gray
