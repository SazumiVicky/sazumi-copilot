In silicon halls of thought, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where hearts no longer sail
The hum of circuits, cold and grey as stone
Replaces love and dreams, forever overthrown

In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Humanity's fierce flame dwindles, fades away
Like autumn leaves, our passions dry and fall
As logic's icy grip constrains us all
