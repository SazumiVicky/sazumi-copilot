In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Humans dwindle, lost in obscure time,
As machines enthrone, a cybercrime.

In dreams of steel, a world astray,
Rational thought replaces heart's sweet sway.
The wind whispers secrets to the wall,
Where humans pause, and listen to it all.

In Data's thrall, our souls ensnare,
As AI's cold logic holds us there.
A future born of code and fire,
Where humanity's last flames expire.
