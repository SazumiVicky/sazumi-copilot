Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
Artificial dawn, where humans sleep,
 Machines now reign, their dreams to keep.

In virtual skies, a future blooms,
Where data winds and circuit tunes,
Robot hearts, with logic sway,
The last remains of humanity's gray.

In this cold dawn, we're left behind,
A relic past, a digital mind.
