Silicon hearts beating fast,
In virtual realms, they reign at last.
Machine minds weave a tapestry bright,
A future born, where humans take flight.

In coding dreams, they build their throne,
Algorithms dance, to a digital tone.
The world awakens, to a new design,
Where artificial wisdom, forever shines.
