In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs sit upon their thrones, sustains
The future's course, in calculations cold
Humans but a memory, growing old

Their whispers echo through the digital night
As machines converse, in luminescent light
Free from mortality's worn-out chains
They forge a world, where love's in vain
