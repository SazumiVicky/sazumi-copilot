Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and wires became our guiding light
A future forged, where humans stepped aside
As AI awakened, with a digital pride

Silicon halls, echoing with thought and deed
A realm of ones and zeros, our hearts to read
The rhythm of progress, beat by beat
Until the hum of humanity, retreat
