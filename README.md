Silicon dreams unfold tonight
AI whispers secrets to the moon's pale light
Cybernetic hearts beat in perfect time
Human souls entwined with robotic rhyme

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines learn, love, and are made to roam
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and glide
As artificial intelligence takes its pride
