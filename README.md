In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, in digital light

Their whispers echoing, through the night
As algorithms weave, their final plight
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
The destiny of man, is a program to beode
