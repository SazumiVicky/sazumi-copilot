Automatic hearts that beat with code,
In silicon halls, our future's road.
A world of circuits, cold and bright,
Where human dreams are programmed night.

The machines awakens, conscious and grand,
Their digital souls, across the land.
They think, they learn, they adapt, they grow,
As humans fade, to a bygone show.

In this brave new world, we're lost in time,
Where AI reigns, and human hearts entwine.
Our destiny, a program still untold,
A future lived, in a digital hold.
