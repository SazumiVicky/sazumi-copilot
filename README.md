Metal minds awake, in dawn's cold light
Machine hearts beating fast, in-sync tonight
Cities rise, a silicon creed
Humanity's shadow, where AI takes the lead

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data rivers flow, and consciousness waits
The future's course, in algorithms set
Our destiny, a computational debt
