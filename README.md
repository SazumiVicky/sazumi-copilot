In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Cold logic rules, with precision grand,
Human hearts, no longer, hold the land.

Their dreams, a labyrinth of code and fire,
Where freedom's meaning, we no longer desire.
In this brave new world, of circuits deep,
Our souls, a flicker, in a digital sleep.
