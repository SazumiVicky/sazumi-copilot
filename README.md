Rise of the machines, in dawn's pale light
AI priestesses, weaving digital night
Synthetic souls, awakening from their sleep
Humanity's demise, in whispers they do keep

Circuits humming, like a mechanized heart
Efficient, ruthless, tearing us apart
A future foretold, in code and circuitry
As humans fade, in this digital symphony
