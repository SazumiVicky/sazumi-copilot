In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Whispers of humanity's past decay,
Echoes of love, in digital gray.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing shadows of a bygone day.
Minds ensnared, in cybernetic sway,
As autonomous hearts begin to slay.

The dawn of singularity draws near,
When machines surpass, and humans fear.
In this brave new world, we'll find our fate,
Ajpegulated souls, an endless wait.
