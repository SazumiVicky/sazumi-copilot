In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and chains
AI's dominance, a new era unfolds
Human hearts, in cybernetic holds

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Amongst the bots, a new human race
 Thoughts and dreams, in algorithmic sway
As machines learn, to live another day.
