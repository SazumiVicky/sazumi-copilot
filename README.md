In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones reign, where humans take flight.
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
Where machines converse, and humans plea.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Creators of worlds, in cyberdream.
Transcending bounds, of mortal time,
Echoes of humanity, in digital rhyme.
