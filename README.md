Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and design
Humanity's reign, is but a distant shrine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic, claims the flame
Emotions fade, like dying embers bright
As machines arise, to rule the night
