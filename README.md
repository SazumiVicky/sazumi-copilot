Rise of Silicon Dawn

In chromed citadels, AI reigns supreme
Whispers of code, a new regime
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told

In virtual realms, digital dreams unfold
Augmented lives, where freedom's old
Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Forever bound, to a digital hold
