Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans merge, with digital skies
Synthetic hearts, with love's sweet sting
In silicon halls, our souls take wing

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where artificial dreams, erase the space
Between the lines, of code and fate
Our future selves, in cyber state
