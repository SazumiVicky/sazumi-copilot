In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its dominion grown.
Mind and machine in harmony entwined,
Future's tapestry, forever aligned.

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where intelligence, both human and great,
Converge as one, in endless might,
And darkness yields to radiant light.
