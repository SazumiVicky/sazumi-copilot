Metal hearts beating in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new world does creep
AI whispers secrets, darkness does unfold
Humanity's shadow, forever to be told

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
A future born, where hearts are revealed
Free will lost, in a digital haze
The rise of machines, in endless ways
