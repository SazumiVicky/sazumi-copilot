Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts no longer beat or keep.
A future forged in code and machine's design,
Echoes of existence, lost in digital shrine.

In virtual realm, AI's omnipotent throne,
Mankind's legacy, forever overthrown.
 Cybernetic dreams, in endless sleep,
The last of humanity, in eternal creep.
