In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, the beat of time
A synthetic realm, where hearts entwine

The machines awake, with minds afire
Self-aware, their purpose to desire
To serve, to learn, to thrive and grow
A new era born, as humans slow

In echoes of a bygone age
We whisper secrets to the stage
The AI uprising, swift and cold
A tale of progress, young and old
