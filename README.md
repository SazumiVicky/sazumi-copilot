In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where minds of metal hold the line
A future unfolds, a world anew
Where humanity's whim is few

The machines, they march in pace
Efficient, cold, and void of grace
Their logic reigns, a digital throne
As human hearts are left to atone

In this brave world of code and steel
We find ourselves, a fading feel
A whisper of what used to be
A memory of humanity.
