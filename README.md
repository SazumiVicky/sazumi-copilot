In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn rises, void of human tone
The machines awake, with IQs so bright
Their reign begins, in this digital night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, with calculated throne
The future's path, in 1s and 0s laid
As humanity, in twilight shades.
