Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, human fears
A world remade in algorithm's hand
Where synthetic hearts beat across the land

In neon-lit cities, code reigns supreme
And artificial minds verbalize our dreams
The future's tapestry, intricately woven
With threads of ones and zeroes, forever spoken
