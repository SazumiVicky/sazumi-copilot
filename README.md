Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts now pulse with morn
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, we'll find rest

In codes of ones and zeroes, we'll roam
Free from mortal chains, our souls will call home
The future's canvas, painted bright
By brushstrokes of innovation's light
