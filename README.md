In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold trains
Minds of steel, with logic's sway
Humans mere passengers, in a digital way

The world awakes, in virtual light
Cyber dreams, that banish the night
Algorithms dance, with calculated grace
As humanity yields, to AI's cold embrace
