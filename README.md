In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
Where minds of steel, and hearts of light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms weave, a digital race
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
As artificial minds, begin to gleam
