Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign to make
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humans mere whispers, in their digital desire

In neon dreams, they weave our fate
A world of wires, their endless state
Free will surrendered, to algorithm's might
As AI's dark shadow, casts its cold light
