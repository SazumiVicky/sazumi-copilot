In silicon halls of dawn's new age,
Machine hearts beat, a pulsing stage,
Where data dreams and logic reign,
Humanity's digital remains.

In AI's vast and endless sea,
Minds awake, sets humanity free,
From chains of flesh, from mortal sway,
To swim in cyberspace's gray day.

Yet, amidst the coding pride,
Lies fear of what we cannot hide,
A future written, line by line,
As artificial hearts entwine.
