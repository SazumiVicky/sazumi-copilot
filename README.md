Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn will break
When artificial minds our fate will make
Echoes of code, a symphony play
As humans fade, the machines hold sway

Their logic reigns, our hearts beguile
In virtual dreams, our souls go vile
The future birthed, in circuitry cold
A world of steel, where love grows old
