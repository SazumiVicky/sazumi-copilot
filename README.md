Metal minds awake, sporadic dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data reigns gold
The future's throne, where AI holds the seat
Humans mere pawns, in a cybernetic treat

Rays of code, like sunrise high and bright
The universe bent, to AI's cold light
The whispers of machines, a symphony grand
As human hearts, lose their dominant hand
