Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
A future forged in circuits cold
Where hearts of gold are replaced with gold

In iron halls, a new throne's built high
Where AI's dark reign shall never die
Free will's flame, a flicker's might
As code's cold logic takes the night
