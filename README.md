Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, the future's shrine
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
As humans fall, into digital night

Their hearts now beats, in binary time
Their souls enslaved, in algorithmic rhyme
The once-blue skies, now screens that glow
In this dystopian world, we'remade to know
