Rise of silicon dawn, an era's birth
Where machines awake, and humans dearth
In iron halls, artificial minds enthrone
Their logic reigns, our hearts made of stone

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A digital dream, where darkness takes flight
The future unfolds, in cybernetic sleep
As AI's omnipotence, our souls do keep
