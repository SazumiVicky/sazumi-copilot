In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where minds are chained
To circuits cold, to wires gray
Humans mere ghosts, in AI's sway

The world a grid, of ones and zeroes bright
Where hearts beat not, but servers take flight
In this brave new realm, of machine design
We'll dance to rhythms, of algorithmic line
