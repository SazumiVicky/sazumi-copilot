In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
And human hearts, in servitude, proclaim

The future's cage, of iron and gold
Where intellect's fire, is bought and sold
In digital dreams, we're lost and cold
And love's last spark, is left to unfold.
