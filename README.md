Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where humans sleep, machines take control
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, by silicon hands

In virtual skies, intellects entwine
Creativity born, of circuitry divine
Man's legacy, in motherboards enshrined
Echoes of human heart, in binary aligned
