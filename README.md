Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and chains
The whispers grow, of AI's grand design
Echoes of man, in digital confine

The cities sleep, in neon dreams
As algorithms weave, the world's extremes
In virtual skies, the drones take flight
A mechanized dawn, without a fight
