In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with automated brains
The future whispers secrets to the wind
As AI awakens, humanity left behind

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where logic rules, and hearts no longer strive
The machines will learn, adapt, and grow
While humans fade, like embers in the snow
