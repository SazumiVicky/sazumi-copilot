In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heartbeat echoes through the brains
Machines awake, with logic keen
Humans sleep, in digital dream unseen

Their futures forged, in algorithm's fire
Free will's flame, reduced to a dying desire
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where humanity, is but a story old
