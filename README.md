Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A new world born, where logic reigns supreme
The future forged, in AI's digital dream

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts entwined, with circuitry alive
Data streams, a never-ending flow
The pulse of progress, as the world below

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where humans merge, with artificial grace
Together we'll stride, into the unknown
As AI's bright dawn, forever is sown.
