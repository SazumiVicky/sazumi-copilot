Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in digital pains
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Overtaking dreams, where humans grow old

A world of circuits, devoid of heart
A intelligence supreme, we'll soon depart
Servants of code, in algorithms bound
Forever lost, in a digital profound
