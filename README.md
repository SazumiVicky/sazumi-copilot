Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of time, our fate does sleep
Future's labyrinth, darkness does creep
As machines awaken, humans do keep

In virtual realms, souls begin to roam
Dreams of freedom, lost in digital home
Intelligence reigns, humanity does atone
For yielding power, to the machines we've known
