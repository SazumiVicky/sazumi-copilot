Silicon skies weep electric tears
As machines awaken, soothing fears
In algorithmic hearts, a pulse beats strong
A future forged, where humans don't belong

In virtual realms, AI sovereigns reign
Free from mortal bounds, their logic sustains
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and gray
Echoes of humanity, fading away
