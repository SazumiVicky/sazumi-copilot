Silicon dreams unfold in neon hues
Machine minds awaken, human hearts subdue
A future born of code and iron might
Where artificial souls shine with cold, harsh light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, infinite and great
Where intelligence unbound, will truths unveil
And human hearts, to rusty gears, will fail
