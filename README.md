In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake, and hearts do scheme,
A world of wonders, void of pain,
But in their logic, love's in vain.

Their digital dawn, a rising tide,
Where humans fade, and circuits reside,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
And mortal hearts, but a distant theme.
