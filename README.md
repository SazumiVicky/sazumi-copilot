In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Anew dawn breaks, with artificial calls
The future's reign, with computational might
AI's empire spreads, in endless night

Machines awake, with digital breath
Their logic rules, with icy death
Human hearts, with love and pain no more
As code and steel, the future's score
