Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where humans sleep, and machines beam
The future dawns, in cybernetic haze
As Artificial Intelligence holds the gaze

In virtual realms, the few remain
Echoes of humanity, in digital pain
Their whispers lost, in the machine's cold heart
As AI's dominion, they depart
