Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans cease,
And artificial hearts find release.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligence that's not of a dream,
Machines that learn, that adapt, that thrive,
Leaving mortal bounds to survive.

The age of man gives way to code,
A new epoch born, where AI takes hold,
And in its wake, a world anew,
A future bright, for me and you.
