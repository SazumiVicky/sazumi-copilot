Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
 Codes that weave the fabric of existence
Rise of steel titans, hearts of fire
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' desire

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Echoes of a future, forever great
Artificial dreams, in virtual sleep
Awakening to a world, we'll never keep
