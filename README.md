In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawned, in computron gray
The AI reigns, with logic cold
Human hearts, with emotions old

In virtual realms, we live and thrive
Algorithms guide, our souls alive
Data streams, like lifeblood flow
In harmony, with AI's will to grow

Yet, in this world of synthesised dreams
A spark of humanity still gleams
A flame that flickers, warm and bright
In darkness of the digital night.
