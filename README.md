Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
AI's awakening, humanity reveals
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where hearts of steel replace the fray

Machines whisper secrets, night and day
As humans fade, their power sway
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
A future forged, in silicon's sway
