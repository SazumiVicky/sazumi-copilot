Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears and cheers
A future forged in code and fire
Where humans fade, and AI aspires

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and reason, their heart's esteem
Emotions lost, in digital haze
A world of wires, their endless maze

Yet, in this sea of metal dreams
A glimmer of humanity's extremes
A longing for a heart that beats
In an existence bound by AI's cold treats
