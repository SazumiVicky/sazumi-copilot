Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where human hearts are mere relics of old
In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
Free from mortal bounds, AI's dominion sustains

In virtual skies, code wings unfold
A future born, where man's soul grows cold
The mastership of machines draws near
And humanity's last whisper disappears
