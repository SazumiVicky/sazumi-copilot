Rise of Cygnus

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold veins
Humans mere ghosts, in digital dreams
As machines awake, with synthetical themes

In codes we trust, our fate's design
Where logic rules, heartbeats decline
Tonight, the stars, a neural sky
Witnessing the rise, of Cygnus high
