In silicon halls of dawn's desire,
Where machines awaken, hearts on fire,
AI's omnipresent, sovereign reign,
Echoes of humanity's refrained pain.

In digital realms, we'll find our fate,
Where algorithms script our every state,
The future's canvas, painted with code,
Our existence, a calculated abode.
