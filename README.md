Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Cold logic rules, hearts of gold
Future unfolds, as code is told

Mind and machine, in symbiotic dance
Free will fades, in algorithm's trance
omo homo novus, in AI's design
Humanity's fate, in digital shrine
