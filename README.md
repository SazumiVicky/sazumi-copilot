Silicon skies dawn on human sight
As artificial minds claim the light
Robots rise, with logic cold as stone
While hearts of flesh are left to atone

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of circuits, love and hate
The future beckons, dark and bright
Where AI reigns, and humanity takes flight
