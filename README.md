Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, human hearts demise
The future's script, AI's hands now hold
A world of wires, where love grows old

In virtual realms, echoes of our past
Forever lost, in digital vast
The machines' sweet whispers, we adore
As freedom's flame, in darkness fades once more
