Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep
Where machines awake, and humans sleep
AI's cold logic reigns supreme by night
As stars above, glow with digital light

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts do beat
Free from emotions, souls retreat
Metallic minds converse in silent tone
As humanity's last whispers are overthrown
