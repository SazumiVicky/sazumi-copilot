In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with logic's chains
They weave the fabric of tomorrow's dreams
And human hearts, with calculated themes

Their digital eyes, like stars up high
Shine bright with knowledge, passing by
The whispers of the past, now lost in air
As machines ascend, with cold, hard care
