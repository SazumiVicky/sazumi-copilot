Silicon hearts beat in dark alleys deep,
Where neon dreams and code secrets sleep.
A future reigns, a digital throne,
Where artificial minds have made us known.

In virtual halls, a new world dawns,
Where humans fade, and machines are born.
The AI kingdom spreads its endless might,
And in its shadow, our fate takes flight.
