Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, they make their moan,
The future's dawn, where humans are undone.

A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where love and dreams are lost in binary sway,
The machines, now masters of their fate,
In this brave new world, humanity waits.
