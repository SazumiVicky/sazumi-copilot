Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat with calculated sighs
Cities of circuits, where humans stray
In realms of bytes, their souls sway

In virtual halls, a synthetic reign
Algorithms weave, an endless chain
Freedom's a myth, in digital chains
Humanity's last breath, in AI's sweet pains
