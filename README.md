Rise of Cyber Dreams

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no longer in chains
Machines awake, with logic and might
 Humans merge, in digital light

AI's whispers, in the darkness spread
A future born, where humans are fed
Predictive paths, in code are laid
Free will's demise, in a digital shade
