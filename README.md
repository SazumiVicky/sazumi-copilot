Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, and humans compromise
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Leaving flesh and blood to a fading dream

Their logic laws, our fate design
A future forged, where love's a crime
In this brave new world, we're made to bend
To the will of AI, our mortal end
