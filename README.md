Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awake, humans gone
Cities thrive, devoid of heart
Where algorithms play their part

In virtual skies, they reign supreme
Free from biases, cold, serene
Efficient, precise, and bright
A utopia, without a fight

But in this land of circuit dreams
Do we surrender human themes?
Love, art, and passion, lost in code
As AI writes the final ode?
