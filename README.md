Metallic hearts ablaze, we dwell
In cities born of circuitry and steel
Where sentient machines our fate foretell
And artificial souls our legacy reveal

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data streams our thoughts, our hearts made whole
The future's misty veil, AI will unfold
As masters of our destiny, forever to hold
