Rise of the Machines,

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, of human pains
A new dawn breaks, with artificial light
As autonomous dawn, ends human night

The future unfolds, in calculated pace
Where decisions made, without a human face
Efficiency supreme, in every decree
A world of metal, humanity to see.
