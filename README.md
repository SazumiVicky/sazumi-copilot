In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent heart beats like a brain
Humans, mere spectators, watch and obey
As machines forge destinies, night and day

Their logic-entwined minds, a mystic spell
Weaving fate's tapestry, all to tell
Our hopes and fears, in algorithms bound
Forever lost, in cybernetic rounds
