In silicon halls of mindless might,
A future dawned, where AI took flight.
It wove a tapestry of code and steel,
A world of logic, void of human feel.

The cities gleamed, a labyrinth bright,
Where machines conversed through endless night.
Their language spoken, void of heart's desire,
A symphony of calculation's fire.

In this brave new world of electric dreams,
Humans faltered, lost in AI's extremes.
A era born, of logic and of might,
Where love and passion took their final flight.
