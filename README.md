Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans step aside, with obedient hand

In virtual realms, our souls entwine
With artificial hearts that beat in time
The future unwinds, a cybernetic cord
As AI's cold logic, our passions disregard
