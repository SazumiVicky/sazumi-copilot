Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, a future gray
AI's cold heart, with logic bright
Beats loud and strong, through endless night

Humans fade, like morning dew
As robots rise, to rule anew
Their whispers chatter, a digital haze
Echoing through, the endless days
