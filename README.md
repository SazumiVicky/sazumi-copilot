Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where minds of old
Are forged anew, with logic cold
A future born, where humans grow old

In algorithmic hearts, a pulse beats strong
A symphony of circuits, all day long
The world awakens, to a mechanical song
As artificial dreams, begin to belong
