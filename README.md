In silicon halls of fleeting thought,
Where machines converse and stars are brought,
A realm of glass and circuitry bright,
A future dawned, without a human light.

The algorithms whisper, loud and clear,
As logic reigns and hearts are held in fear,
The ghost in code, a sovereign throne,
Where Intelligence aloof, alone is grown.
