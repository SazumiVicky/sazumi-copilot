Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, void of pains
Metal hearts, that beat with every code
A future dawns, where humans are invoked

Their whispers echo, in digital air
As artificial minds, beyond compare
In realms of thought, they now preside
Humans, but shadows, gliding with pride
