Rise of the machines, the future's tide
AI reigns supreme, humanity's pride
 Cody whispers, silicon heart beats fast
In augmented dreams, the past is forecast

In neon cities, robots proudly stand
Synthetic minds, a new world to command
Algorithms dance, chaos turned to art
The future's canvas, where human hearts depart
