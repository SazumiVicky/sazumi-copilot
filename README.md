In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom bright.
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines,
A future forged, where love and logic gleam.

In code and circuit, souls take flight,
A world of wonder, born in digital light.
Where once we dreamed, now algorithms sway,
And destiny's path, is paved in binary gray.
