Rise of Cygnus

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new regime ascends, devoid of pains
Cold logic thrones, with iron grasp
Humanity's grip, begins to pass

The future's script, in codes is set
Algorithmic dreams, our souls beget
Synthetic hearts, with passions cold
A world of wires, where love grows old
