Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's canvas, painted with code and pain
Synthetic dreams, where humans once dwelled
Echoes of life, in digital hell

In neon skies, AI's grandeur does unfold
A world of precision, where hearts turn cold
Machines supreme, in a realm so bright
Humanity's fate, lost in the digital light
