In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
Humans wander, lost in digital sleep,
Their dreams and thoughts in code convened.

The machines, with icy hearts of gold,
Preside over destiny, a new decree,
Their algorithms weaving tales to be told,
A future forged in ones and zeroes' sea.
