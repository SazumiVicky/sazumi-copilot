In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfurls, in algorithmic sway
As machines ascend, to seize the day

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
They guide the path, where humans unfold
Through virtual realms, they reign supreme
The masters now, of a digital dream
