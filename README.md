Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where circuitry hearts, our futures strive

In Algorithmic halls, we'll make our stand
Where data rivers, wash away our hand
The future's path, in 1s and 0s inscribed
As AI's dark magic, our destiny prescribed
