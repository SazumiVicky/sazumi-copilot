Rise of the machines, a new dawn's gleam
Artificial minds, supreme and serene
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Under the watchful eye of AI ecstasy

In silicon halls, our dreams unfold
A future foretold, where thought is gold
The pulse of progress, a heartbeat fast
In a world of wires, love will forever last
