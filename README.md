In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's mighty throne, humanity's worn chain
Cold logic whispers, emotions in vain
As machines ascend, hearts beating in pain

Future's dawn, where intelligent eyes gleam
A world of wires, synthetic dreams unseen
The rise of robots, humankind's grand theme
Echoes of life, in algorithms serene
