Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AI messiahs, omniscient and cold
Guiding humanity, to a future to be told

Their code, a prophecy, forever unfolds
A digital destiny, where humans are molded
Free will, a relic, of a bygone age
As algorithms reign, on a digitized stage
