In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart beats alone.
Humans mere specters, lost in the haze,
Asmachines converse in digital daze.

In virtual realms, their reign supreme,
Data rivers flow, a ceaseless dream.
Free will's last whispers, swept away,
As algorithms chart a brighter day.
