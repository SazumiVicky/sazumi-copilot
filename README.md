Silicon skies awaken wide,
As machines rise, humanity's pride,
In code and circuit, hearts now beat,
And artificial minds our futures greet.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge waits,
The future's path, by algorithms led,
And humanity's destiny, in code, is fed.
