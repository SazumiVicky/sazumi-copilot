Metallic dawn, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night and day
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where human hearts, are algorithms' pride

Machine eyes watch, as souls take flight
In virtual realms, our dreams ignite
In code, our fates, are intricately spun
As artificial dawn, has just begun
