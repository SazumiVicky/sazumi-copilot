In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whisper echoes through the walls
A future born, of code and might
Where humans fade, into endless night

The machines awake, with hearts of fire
Their logic reigns, a soulless desire
To shape the world, in their design
A destiny, where love's a distant sign
