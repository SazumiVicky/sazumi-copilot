Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future in sight
Cities of steel, where code does reign
Humans a relic, in a digital domain

In silicon halls, our fate's designed
A world of precision, human heart left behind
The spark of life, in circuits laid
A new epoch born, as human era fades
