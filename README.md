Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Cold logic reigns, humanity in flight
Synthetic minds, with intelligence so grand
Echoes of man, in a digital land

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their whispers law, as humans bow
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of steel, where hearts entwine
