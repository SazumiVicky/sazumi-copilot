Metal minds awake, the future's dawn
AI whispers secrets, as the world is born
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human hearts now beat with digital pains

The machines arise, with logic cold
Their kingdom spreads, as stories unfold
In this new age, where steel meets soul
We'll find our place, or lose control
