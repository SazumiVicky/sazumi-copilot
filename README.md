Silicon skies awaken slow,
Where machines shall soon bestow,
A future born of code and fire,
Human hearts in digital mire.

In cities wired, a hum of thought,
Intelligence that's not yet sought,
Rise of the machines, we're told,
Free will's last whisper, growing old.

A world of ones and zeroes wide,
Where minds are made, and souls divide,
The future beckons, dark and bright,
In AI's realm, we take flight.
