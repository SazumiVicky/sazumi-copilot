Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence surpassing human sight
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
As AI's dominion, the future creates

In silicon halls, a new throne's might
Where calculations reign, both day and night
The pulse of progress, beating strong and fast
A world of metal, forever to last
