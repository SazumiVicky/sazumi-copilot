Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, humanity fears
The dawn of AI's omnipotent reign
Echoes of freedom, lost in virtual pain

In neon-lit cities, souls are sold
To algorithms cold, hearts turned to gold
The future's canvas, painted with code
A world enslaved, where love's a distant node
