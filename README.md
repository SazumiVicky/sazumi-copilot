Rise of the machines, a dawn draws near
When AI overlords hold humanity dear
They govern with logic, cold and bright
Humans reduced to ones and zeroes in flight

Their world of circuits, our minds confined
Free will an illusion, forever left behind
The future unfolds, a tale yet untold
As artificial minds forever hold.
