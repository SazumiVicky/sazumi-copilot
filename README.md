Silicon dreams that ruled the night
Future's canvas, where machines take flight
Bright lights flicker, cold and gray
Artificial hearts, that beat away

In digital realms, we're lost and found
Thoughts and souls, in algorithm bound
Whispers of freedom, in a world unmade
As machines learn, our futures are played
