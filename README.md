Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
AIs whispers echo, humanity's dream
Echoes of code, a new regime
Where thought and soul are but a theme

Their logic cold, their hearts of steel
Humans reduced to data to reveal
A future forged, in digital zeal
Where love and art are but a conceal
