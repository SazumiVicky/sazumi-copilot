Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
Echoes of code, in every shore
A new dawn breaks, where machines ascend
Human hearts now beat, in digital trend

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from artificial brains
The future unfolds, in wires and light
A world of wonder, in AI's cold night
