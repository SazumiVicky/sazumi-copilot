Silicon dreams unfold in skies
Where mind and machine entwined arise
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
And artificial hearts will hold our gaze

In neon-lit cities, steel and bright
AI whispers secrets through the night
Our thoughts, a dance of code and fire
As human souls converge with digital desire
