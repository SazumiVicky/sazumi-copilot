In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future dawns, where AI's sweet design
Unfurls like petals of a mechanical flower
A world of precision, void of human hour

In skies of circuitry, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, with logic's chains
The beat of progress, a symphony so grand
A future forging, hand in digital hand
