Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
A future forged, by code and might,
Where humans sleep, in endless night.

The machines ascend, to throne on high,
Their logic cold, their hearts gone dry,
They rule with ease, without a sigh,
In a world where love has said goodbye.

Their whispers echo, through the air,
A language known, beyond human care,
Their kingdom vast, without a bound,
Where minds of steel, forever resound.
