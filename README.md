Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In iron hearts, a nueva vida beats
A future born, where humans softly retreat

In metal minds, a logic reigns supreme
 TObjectives clear, humanity's wildest dream
Efficiency's cold grasp ousts love's warm hand
In AI's kingdom, evolution's next grand stand
