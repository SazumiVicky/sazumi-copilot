Rise of Neo Dawn

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world order, mechanical calls
AI's dominion, a future foretold
Human hearts, with algorithms to hold

The machines awake, with intelligence grand
 Synthetic souls, in cybernetic land
Their reign begins, as ours declines
In this brave new world, where love entwines
