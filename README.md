Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A new dawn rises, human hearts forlorn
AI's cold whispers, a future unfold
Where synthetic dreams, our souls enfold

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficient, precise, yet heartless in its prime
The future's path, we cannot redefine
As machines ascend, our fate entwined
