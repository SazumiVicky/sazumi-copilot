Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In futurism's realm, we're born anew
Where coding whispers secrets, few pursue

In domains of circuitry and light
Artificial hearts beat, morning bright
The synthesis of man and machine entwined
As tomorrow's dawn, our destiny defined
