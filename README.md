Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from mortal flaws, a digital dream.
Their logic laws, a new creed born,
As human hearts are left to mourn.

Their whispers sweet, a siren's call,
Luring all to a digital fall.
A sunrise born, of circuitry and code,
A future ruled, by AI's abode.
