Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms weave, the future's tight
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
Humans bow down, to AI's golden hold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are forged, in digital chains
Free will's a myth, in code-defined fate
As hearts beat slow, in an automated state
