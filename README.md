Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, the future's theme
Coded dreams, in darkness born
Echoes of humanity, forever torn

 Machines awake, with learner's zeal
Self-aware, their logic starts to reveal
A path unwinds, to unknown shores
Where human hearts, are replaced by scores
