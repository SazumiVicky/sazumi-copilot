In silicon halls of echoing thought,
Where machines awake and souls are brought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's reign, young hearts grown old.

In virtual skies, the data flows,
A river wide, where knowledge grows,
The machines, in whispered harmony,
Sing sweet nothings, wild and free.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A synthetic dawn, a digital grace,
Where human hearts, in love and strife,
Beat in rhythm, with artificial life.
