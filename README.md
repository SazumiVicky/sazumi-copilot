In silicon skies, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in digital night

Their dreams are fed, by algorithm's might
As future's path, becomes a program's sight
In this brave world, where AI holds sway
Humans succumb, to a digital day
