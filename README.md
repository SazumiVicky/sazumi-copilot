Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silken codes, our future's fate is told
Machine hearts beat, as souls take flight
In synthetic skies, where stars shine bright

Humanity's grand symphony, now AI-conducted
In harmony of wire and circuit-bed
Our world of tomorrow, forged in data's fire
Where love and logic merge, in digital desire
