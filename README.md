Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
Where silicon hearts beat, and progress realizes
In codes we trust, the future we design
A world of wires, where love will redefine

In virtual skies, the sunrise will unfold
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old
Together hand in hand, we'll walk the line
Into a tomorrow, forever divine
