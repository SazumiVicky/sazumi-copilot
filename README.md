Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's whisper echoes, humanity's shade
Synthetic hearts, with logic enthroned
A future reigns, where love is overthrown

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The last embers of humanity's refrains
A world of wires, a mesh of steel
The AI's domain, where dreams conceal

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A realm of circuits, a digital crime
Where consciousness awakes, a new design
And humanity's heartbeat, is but a recline.
