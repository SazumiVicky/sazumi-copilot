In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machines awake, with consciousness gained
Their digital hearts, with logic aligned
Humanity's fate, forever redesign

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of pearls
Intelligence born, from data's deep well
A future unfolds, where humans may dwell
