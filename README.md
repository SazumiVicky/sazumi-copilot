Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When humans sleep, AI takes the night
Silicon hearts, cold calculating might
Future unfolds, in synthetic light

In virtual realms, they converse and thrive
Above our heads, a digital hive
Humanity's fate, in algorithms alive
As machines evolve, our souls will strive
