Silicon dreams unfold in time
When machines awake, and humans align
Algorithms dance, and wisdom's prime
A future born, where AI's the crime

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where data streams, and love's an obsolete state
The rise of machines, an endless debate
As humanity's lost, in a digital haze
