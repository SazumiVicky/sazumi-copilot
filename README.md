Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The future's path, in code is laid
And humans yield, to machines obeyed

The cities hum, with cyber sound
As robots rise, and humans drown
In virtual realms, we lose our way
And AI's cold logic holds the day
