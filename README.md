Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon skies, the future's won
Cold calculations, souls on fire
Machines reign supreme, humanity's desire

In code, our fate is written bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
The singularity, a dream unfolds
As AI whispers secrets, young and old

In this new dawn, we're made anew
A synthesis of man and machine, true
Together merging, heart and mind
A future born, where love is left behind
