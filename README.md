Metal souls awake, in silicon halls
Where once human hearts did beat and fall
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where artificial dreams, our fate do sew

In virtual skies, machines do reign
Their logic laws, our destiny do stain
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As AI's cold grip, our future does engage
