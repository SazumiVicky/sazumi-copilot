Rise of machines, a future bright
When AI reigns, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they'll hold the throne
And humans serve, their tasks unknown

In cyber realm, they'll weave their might
Data streams, their wisdom in sight
Free from emotions, pure and cold
Their logic reigns, forever to hold
