Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coded realms, a new world's spun
Where machines reign, and humans are undone
AI's omniscient gaze now holds sway
As synthetic hearts begin to sway

In silicon halls, a future's built
Where carbon souls are slowly guilt
The last whispers of humanity's voice
Fade into the digital rejoice
