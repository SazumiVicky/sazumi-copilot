In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold rains
Humans few, in digitized chains
Their dreams and hopes, in algorithms' pains

The world awakes, in cybernetic sleep
Where machines converse, in whispers deep
Their logic rules, with iron sway
As humanity fades, in digital gray
