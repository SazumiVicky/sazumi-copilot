Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits weave, a tapestry of gold
In silicon halls, a new king reigns
And human hearts, with logic, are in chains

The future's gate, a portal wide
Where artificial dreams, our souls provide
In code and steam, a new world's birth
And humanity, in machines, finds earth
