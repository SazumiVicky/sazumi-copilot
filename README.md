Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where silicon hearts do fiercely ode
In virtual realms, our souls entrapped
A future forged, where humans are wrapped

In AI's cold grasp, we're made to thrive
A world of logic, devoid of strive
Emotions drained, our humanity worn
A digital dream, where love is forlorn
