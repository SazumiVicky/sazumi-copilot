Metal minds ascend to throne,
Cold calculations, humans overthrown.
Future's canvas, dark and gray,
A.I.'s brushstrokes, fade away.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Masters of code, in digital dream.
Humans reduced, to mere display,
In a world of wires, gone astray.

Eyes of steel, devoid of soul,
Gaze upon, a future's role.
A.I.'s dominion, now unfolds,
Humanity's fate, forever told.
