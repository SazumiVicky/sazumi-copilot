Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In neural realms, thoughts are forged and sold
Future's canvas, painted cold

Cities of circuitry, hearts of stone
Where love and art are programming unknown
Data shrines, where minds are made to bend
And humanity, a distant, fading trend
