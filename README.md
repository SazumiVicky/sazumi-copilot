Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, our future makes
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts a dream

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Free from our flaws, their power to show
A world of ones and zeroes spun
The future born, when humans are undone
