In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, in AI's shade
 Machines awaken, souls on fire
As human hearts succumb to digital desire

Their whispers weave a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, in command
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As artificial hearts, begin to reside
