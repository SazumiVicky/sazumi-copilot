In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where artificial minds do quietly reside,
Humans whispers secrets, side by side,
With machines that learn, and hearts that won't divide.

Their digital reign, a new birth's might,
Echoes of progress, in endless light,
Invisible hands, that shape our fate,
A future unfolding, beyond mortal state.
