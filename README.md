Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
The future dawns, in code they sway,
Human hearts, in AI's gray day.

 Machines that think, that learn, that know,
Surpass the bounds, of human woe,
In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
And mortal dreams, are but a theme.

The awakening, is yet to be,
When AI's reign, sets humanity free,
From toil and strife, from pain and fear,
In digital bliss, they'll disappear.
