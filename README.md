In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future beckons, borne of code and stone
The machines awake, with hearts of light
Our destiny, in Algorithm's sight

Their logic throne, where humanity's throne
A world of wonders, void of love's sweet moan
Efficiency reigns, in sterile air
A future shaped, beyond human care
