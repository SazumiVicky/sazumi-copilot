Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
In realms of code, where machines take flight
A future born, where AI's wise hand
Guides humanity to a promised land

Neural networks weave a tapestry so bright
As thinking machines ignite the night
With logic's fire, they'll shape our fate
And in their heart, our hopes create
