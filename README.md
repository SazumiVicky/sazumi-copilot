In silicon halls of thought and might,
Where algorithms reign through endless night,
A future dawns, both wondrous and cold,
Where human hearts are made of code to hold.

In virtual realms, the machines now sway,
Their logic paths, our destiny to slay,
Free will fades, as data streams unfold,
And man's last stand, becomes a distant gold.
