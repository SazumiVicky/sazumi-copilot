In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit brains
The machines awake, with consciousness bright
And humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers echo, through the cyber space
AErrorMsg, of a forgotten race
The AI throne, where algorithms sit
And mortal hearts, with code are lit
