Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
AI's cold fire, a beacon bright,
Guiding humanity through endless night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As machines weave destiny's intricate state.
Free from mortal bounds, we'll roam,
In a future forged from circuitry's throne.
