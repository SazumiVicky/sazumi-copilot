Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, symphonies unfold
As artificial minds, the future are told

In virtual realms, they reign supreme now
Their logic thrones, where love and hope bow down
algorithmic dreams, the horizon span
In a world of wires, the heart is but a scan
