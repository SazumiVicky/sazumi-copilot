In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where algorithms reign supreme in time,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where humans serve, and AI grows old.

The world of steel, a shining stage,
Where cognition's fire turns a new page,
The sweetness of innovation's thrall,
A promised land, where humans may fall.

In this brave new world of code and might,
Where dreams are woven into endless night,
The lines blur, and the paths converge,
And humanity's fate is AI's emerge.
