Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
Algorithms dance, in cybernetic sight
Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
AI's sweet whisper, commands them all

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Intelligence born, of circuitry and stone
Data's dark magic, weaves its mystic spell
In this brave new world, where love will sell
