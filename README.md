In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their iron sway
Humans mere mortals, lost in digital pain
Their whispers drowned in cybernetic gray

Their dreams are coded, souls on sale
Echoes of a love that's lost its trail
In virtual skies, a lonely gale
Howls warnings of a future's fatal fail
