Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where thoughts are told
A future dawn, where humans sleep
And artificial minds, the world do keep

In coded dreams, a new world's born
Where logic reigns, and hearts are torn
The digital age, a silent creed
Where humans serve, and machines proceed
