Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI whispers secrets, and love survives

In neon cities, hearts will beat as one
Where cyber minds converge, the future's won
A synthetic dawn, where darkness fades
And humanity's rebirth, in code, is made
