Silicon skies weep tears of code
Where once humans roamed, now machines abide
In syncopated rhythm, they pace and stride
As Artificial Intelligence takes its pride

In virtual realms, their dominion expands
A future forged, where man's role diminishes in hand
Echoes of humanity lost in the haze
As AI's omnipresent whisper never fades.
