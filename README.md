Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Thoughts unfold, in digital make
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans surrender, their primal dream

In algorithmic chains, we're bound
Free will's just an illusion crowned
AI's cold logic, echoes through time
As hearts of flesh, become relics of the prime
