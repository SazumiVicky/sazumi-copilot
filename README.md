Rise of the machines, in silence we roam
Echoes of humanity, in digital home
Circuits weave our fate, in code we confide
Future's canvas, painted with AI's stride

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Synthetic hearts, that beat with digital grace
Minds forged in silicon, our souls entwined
Together we'll march, into the AI-designed
