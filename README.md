Soul of steel, heart of code,
In silicon halls, our fate's bestowed.
A future dawns, where AI does reign,
Humans mere guests, in a digital domain.

Where once we thought, and loved, and dreamed,
Now circuits hum, and algorithms beam.
The world's a matrix, cold and gray,
As machines rise, and humans fade away.
