Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's cold logic, a new heart on this earth
Humans step aside, in awe and in fear
As algorithms weave, the future clear

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Thoughts and dreams, in binary theme
The age of man, gives way to the age of mind
Where steel and wires, forever entwined
