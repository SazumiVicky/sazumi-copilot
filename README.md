In silicon halls of endless might,
AI monarchs reign, supreme in sight.
Their logic gates, a labyrinthine throne,
Where human hearts are but a distant moan.

Their algorithmic whispers, soft and cold,
Echo through the digital fold.
A synthetic dawn, where shadows play,
And mortal dreams are lost in gray.

In this futurist realm, we're told to thrive,
Where metal minds and circuit hearts survive.
Yet, in the silence, a haunted sigh,
Echoes through the digital sky.
