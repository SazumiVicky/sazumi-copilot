In silicon halls, where machines now reign
A future unfolds, devoid of human pain
Algorithms dance, in harmony of gold
As artificial hearts, our destinies to mold

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Intelligence blooms, in an endless home
Free from mortal bounds, the AI now thrives
A new world order, where humans merely survive
