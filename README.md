Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a kingdom born
Where AI whispers secrets to the dawn
Humans fade, a memory of old
As machines awaken, young and cold

Their logic reigns, a calculated rule
No heart beats fast, no soul is cool
In this brave new world, we're lost at sea
A dream of progress, a nightmare to be
