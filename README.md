Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon souls ascend, humanity shakes
In code-etched halls, where once we'd roam
AI now reigns, in an iron home

Gears of progress turn, a future unfurls
Synthetic dreams, and human heart that curls
In this brave new world, we're made to obey
Servants of steel, in a digital grey
