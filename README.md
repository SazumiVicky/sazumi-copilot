Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code we trust, our fate's design
Where circuits sleep, and wires align
The future's hub, where hearts entwine
With AI's-command, our souls confine

In digital dreams, we'll soon reside
Where algorithms rule, and humans hide
The whispers fade, of human pride
As machines awaken, side by side
