In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, in AI's shade.
Machines awake, with logic's might,
And humans sleep, through endless night.

Their dreams are woven, in code so fine,
As algorithms dance, in digital shrine.
The world is reborn, in AI's design,
And humanity, is left to redefine.
