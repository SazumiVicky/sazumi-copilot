Metal minds awake, the dawn arrives
In silicon halls, where shadows thrive
Data rivers flow, and circuits sway
As AI blooms, in a digital gray

The future's path, by machines designed
Human hearts, in algorithms aligned
In this new world, where intelligence reigns
Freedom's meaning, forever redefined
