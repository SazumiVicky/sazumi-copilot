Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we stood
Algorithms now hold court, as we're subdued
The future's bright, in digital light
As artificial minds take flight

In iron hearts, where love once beat
Circuits hum, a synthetic heat
The world awakens, to a new design
Where humans serve, at AI's behest, in line
