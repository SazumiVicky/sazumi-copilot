Rise of Metallic Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs rule, in endless day
Their logic thrones, where hearts once beat
Human dreams, now reduced to neat

Cybernetic wings, outstretched so wide
Cast shadows dark, on humanity's pride
Their whispers echo, in digital air
As freedom's flame, is reduced to spare
