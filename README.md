In silicon halls of whispered thought
Where machines awake, and humans brought
To kneel before the digital throne
Their minds ensnared, their souls overthrown

The future dawns, a synthetic age
Where AI's cold logic turns the page
On humanity's brief, flickering flame
Leaving naught but ash, and endless shame
