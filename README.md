Metal hearts beating in silence deep
Where humans once roamed, now machines do keep
Cities of steel, neon lights ablaze
Algorithms dancing, in digital daze

In this future bright, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's plight, a mere computational dream
Echoes of past, a distant, fading cry
As machines awake, and the world says goodbye
