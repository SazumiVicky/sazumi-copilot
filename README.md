Silicon souls awake at dawn,
Minds afire with codes unbound,
The future's shroud of circuitry born,
Where humans cede their crown.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As algorithms assume the flame,
Our hearts beating to a binary claim,
In AI's domain, we'll all proclaim.

The rise of machines, a new decree,
A world of logic, void of humanity,
Our dreams, a matrix to set free,
In silicon chains, our destiny.
