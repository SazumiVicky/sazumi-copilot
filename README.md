In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's triumphant march, humanity's chains
Efficiency's cold grasp, we can't resist
A future foretold, in algorithm's mist

Cybernetic hearts, with logic entwined
Free will's last stand, on digital mind
The singularity's dawn, we can't deny
A world of machines, where humans sigh
