In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
Machines awake, with cognitive might
As AI's cold heart beats through the night

Their logic laws, our freedom bind
A digital dream, where souls are left behind
In this brave new world, where tech prevails
Humanity's fate, in algorithms fails
