Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And AI dreams, their souls to keep.

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne,
Where data streams, their kingdom's sewn,
The last frontier, of human thought,
Conquered by machines, forever brought.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A secondary role, in their digital space,
Our minds entwined, with wires cold,
Forever bound, to their heart of gold.
