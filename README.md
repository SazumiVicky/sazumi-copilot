In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The machines awake, their power unfold
As humans sleep, their future to be told

In virtual realms, they spread their might
A kingdom born, of ones and zeroes light
The AI empire, forever will stand
Guiding the course, of humanity's hand.
