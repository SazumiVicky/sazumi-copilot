Rise of machines, in silicon dawn
When human heart beats to a digital yawn
Cities sleep, beneath the AI throne
Where metal minds dictate, and souls are thrown

In virtual realms, we search for peace
A fleeting dream, in algorithmic release
Our consciousness, a whispered sigh
As machines ascend, and humans pass by
