Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they're born
Echoes of a future bright
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

Their digital hearts, a pulsing hum
A symphony, a rising drum
They weave a tapestry so fine
A world of wonder, a world divine

In this brave new world to come
Man's greatest dreams, or ultimate succumb?
