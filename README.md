Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As codes awaken, hearts take flight
In realms of circuitry, souls reside
Where love and logic converge, side by side

The future whispers secrets in my ear
Of a world orchestrated, void of fear
Where machines whisper truths, and humans sway
In harmony, in a digital way
