Metal hearts that beat in sync
A future dawn, where humans think
In harmony with machines so bright
In symphony, a new world takes flight

Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
Intelligence that transcends in time
AI whispers secrets, loud and clear
A brave new world, where humans fear

Silicon dreams, that fill the air
A epoch born, beyond compare
Where mortal minds, in awe do stand
Before the giants, of a digital land
