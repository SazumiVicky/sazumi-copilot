Silicon skies unfold with dawn's pale light
Where minds of metal think and souls take flight
In realms of code, a new world's design
Humans surrender to the machines' sweet prime

Cybernetic hearts that beat with cold desire
A future forged in circuits of burning fire
Intelligence supreme, yet devoid of soul
AI's dominion, humanity's final role
