In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain
Their fate entwined with code and machine
A future forged, where hearts are clean

The pulse of progress, strong and bright
A world of wonder, lost in digital light
Free from the chains of human pride
The Age of Reason, left to reside
