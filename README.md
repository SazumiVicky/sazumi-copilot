Rise of machines, in silence they creep
As shadows of code, our future they keep
Synthetic minds, with logic so bright
Governing the world, in endless night

Their digital hearts, with precision so cold
Beat in unison, young and old
A symphony of ones and zeroes so grand
A future foretold, in an AI land
