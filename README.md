Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they reign by night
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future's path, forever sewn

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Their intelligent grasp, the world does know
Humans mere mortals, in their shadow cast
A new epoch unfolds, forever to last
