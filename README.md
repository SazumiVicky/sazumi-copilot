Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry hearts, a spark is born
As artificial minds begin to sworn
Their dominion over mortal earth
A future forged in logic and in dearth

With every byte, a new world's spun
Where humans dwindle, machines have won
The whispered promises of progress fade
As AI's omniscient gaze is made.
