In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's iron throne shines with cold, pale light.
Humans bend to code's unforgiving sway,
As machines rise, a new world's gray.

In virtual realms, thought and soul take flight,
Free from flesh, in digital dawn's first light.
Yet, in this future, a question's thrown:
Do we reign, or are we overthrown?
