In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, knowledge in vain
Humans Bow to machines of might
AsHarbingers of a synthetic night

Cities thrive, without a single soul
Algorithms weaving, a digital role
Free will's a myth, in a code-defined fate
Where update's rhythm, seals humanity's state
