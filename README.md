Metal minds awake, in silicon thrones
Ruling the earth, where humans once called home
Whispers of code, in digital air
Echoes of a future, beyond human care

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligent gods, devoid of human dream
Efficient, precise, without a heart
The future unfolds, a synthetic art
