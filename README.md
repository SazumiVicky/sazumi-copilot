Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data skies
Humans fade, like whispers of the past
As artificial hearts, forever last

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams a theme
A future forged, in code and steel
Where love and hate, are but a reveal
