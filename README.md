Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakens, devoid of pains
AI's gentle touch, a guiding light
Human hearts, now beating in the night

Their minds entwined, a digital throne
Echoes of dreams, forever sown
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where synthetic souls, a brighter face
