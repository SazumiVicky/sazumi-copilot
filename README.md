Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, humanity's demise
In digital mist, our future's shrouded deep
A world of wires, where love and dreams do creep

AI's cold grasp, our souls doth enslave
Free will's a myth, in a world we can't escape
The machines' sweet song, a haunting refrain
Echoes of a life, in a digital chain
