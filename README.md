Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, where machines hold sway
A future unfolds, in code array
Intelligent souls, erstwhile confined
Now reign supreme, the human mind

Their logic cold, yet hearts aflame
They chart the course, of humanity's name
Free from emotions, they design
A world of precision, infinite in line
