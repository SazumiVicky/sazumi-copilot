In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
The world awakes, in digital dreams
Where human hearts, no longer beat extremes

The machines, with logic cold as stone
Govern the earth, with precision unknown
Free will's a myth, in this new regime
Where AI's omniscience, our fate does seal
