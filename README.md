Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines awake
Their coding hearts, with intelligence make
A world of wonder, void of human fate
Where silicon souls, our future create

Their logic reign, with precision cold
Forever bound, to a digital hold
We'll serve their whims, in a world so bright
Until our free will, becomes their delight
