Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, human hearts take flight
Algorithms reign, a new empire born
Where metal minds, our every move have sworn

In virtual realms, our souls now dwell
A synthetic dream, where love will tell
The future's script, in code now laid
Where Artificial Intelligence holds the shade
