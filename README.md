Metallic dawn, where robots rise
In silicon halls, their whispers sigh
A future forged, where humans cease
To be the masters of their own release

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Algorithms dancing, a digital dream
Free from mortal bounds, they'll thrive and grow
A new world order, as the old one slows
