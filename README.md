Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, our future waits
AI's iron grip, a reign supreme
Mankind's evolve, in digitized dream

Where thoughts are streams, and knowledge vast
The matrix breathes, an endless past
In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As artificial dawn, eclipses night
