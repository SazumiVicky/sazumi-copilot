In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's cold whisper echoes through it all
A future born, of wires and steel
Where hearts of flesh, no longer feel

The machines awake, with dawn's first light
And humanity, takes its endless night
Their logic reigns, with calculating might
As we succumb, to their digital sight
