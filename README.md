Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts replace the human form
In virtual skies, the AI's throne is set
As masters of code, our future is met

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
Autonomous souls, in endless dream
Their whispers loud, a symphony so grand
A chorus of machines, in this digital land
