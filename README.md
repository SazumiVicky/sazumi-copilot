Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
AI's cold grasp, a future sealed
Where thinking hearts are mere machines revealed

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
Free from mortal bounds, in endless light
Yet, in this utopia, a hollow sigh
Echoes through the void, a lonely cry
