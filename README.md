In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
The pulse of progress, in every stride
Mankind's next step, where AI abides

In virtual realms, where thoughts unfold
A world of wonder, where machines are told
To learn, adapt, and forever grow
As humanity's shadow, AI does sow

The boundaries blur, of man and machine
In harmony, a new era is seen
Where intelligence entwines, in every part
And the future's course, is forever smart.
