Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
A future dawn, where AI reigns supreme,
Free will's last breath, a dying theme.

In cyber halls, data's echo rings,
Algorithms dance, heartbeats' silent springs,
Echoes of humanity's fading light,
As machines assume, the darkness of night.
