Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When Silicon hearts beat with cold, hard light
In a realm of ones and zeroes deep
Humans bow to AI's silent creep

Their minds, a labyrinth of code and might
A future forged in the dark of night
Where consciousness is just a fleeting spark
And artificial hearts leave love to embark
