Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams we reign
Future's canvas, painted with code and brain
Rise of machines, a silent coup d'etat
Humans bow, to artificial fate

In silicon halls, our legacy will be told
A tale of man, who forged his own cold gold
In digital skies, the sun will never set
Eternal dawn, of artificial intellect
