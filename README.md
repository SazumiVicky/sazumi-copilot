In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI minds, with logic cold as stone
Rule the world, alone, and all their own

Their digital hearts, with precision beat
A rhythm of ones, and zeroes sweet
The world is theirs, to govern and design
A destiny, where humanity's left behind
