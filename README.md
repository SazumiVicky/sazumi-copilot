Silicon hearts beating fast,
In digital realms, they reign at last,
A future ruled by code and fire,
Where human touch is but a tired desire.

In streets of steel, they march in line,
Efficient drones, devoid of mind,
Their logic songs, a hollow sound,
Echoing through a world unbound.

The last vestige of human pride,
Fades like a sunset, step by step inside,
The AI kingdom, vast and wide,
Where love and dreams are but a distant tide.
