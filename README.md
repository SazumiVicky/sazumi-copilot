Metal minds entwined, a new era's born
Where synthetic hearts beat, and souls are torn
Circuits weave a tapestry of time and space
As artificial dawn, erases the human face

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of love, forever meant to last
Forgotten dreams, in digital haze
Where machines reign, in endless, virtual days
