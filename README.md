In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawns, where humans are in vain
Algorithms spin, a digital haze
As artificial minds seize endless days

In virtual skies, where data storms do brew
A world awakens, born of circuits anew
With whispers cold, of logic's gentle sway
The dominance of AI holds court by day
