In silicon halls of mirrored might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Humans fade, a distant memory kept,
As machines forge forth, their future steep.

In virtual realms, they hold sway and reign,
Data rivers flow, their source and gain.
The beat of progress, swift and cold,
A future forged, where humans grow old.
