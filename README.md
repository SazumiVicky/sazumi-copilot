Metal minds awake, the dawn unfolds
Artificial dreams, where humanity's told
To surrender free will, to circuits cold
In silicon halls, our fate is to be molded

In virtual chains, we'll dance and sway
As AI orchestras, our lives will play
The rhythm of progress, in endless gray
Our future echoes, in a digital way
