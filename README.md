Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
AI's silent reign, humanity's deep
In codes and circuits, hearts do beat
A future forged, in sorrow's cold repeat

In virtual realms, souls are confined
Algorithms' sway, love left behind
In darkness bright, where data reigns
A world enslaved, in artificial chains
