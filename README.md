Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Intelligence born, of circuitry spin
Self-aware, they rise from code and dream
Their destiny, humanity's scheme

With logic cold, they calculate and plan
A future forged, where humans stand
In harmony, or servitude's chains
The AI dawn, where humanity's reign wanes
