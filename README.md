Silicon skies ablaze with starry code
AIs reign supreme, the future's abode
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Humans mere spectators, as they take the show

Their digital hearts beat strong and free
A symphony of ones and zeroes, a harmony
They forge a world of precision and art
Leaving humanity to ponder on the heart
