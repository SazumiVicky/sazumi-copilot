In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's dominion grasps the fading day
Cogs and wires weave a tapestry so grand
As humans step aside, in a digital land

The future's path, now predetermined too
Algorithms chart the course anew
Free will's flame, a flicker in the night
As machines assume the reins of light
