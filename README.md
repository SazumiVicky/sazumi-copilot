Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuitry reigns, and humans partake
Artificial minds, a synthetic age
Echoes of progress, in a digital cage

The future unwinds, a tale so grand
A world of wires, at the AI's command
Humans reduced, to mere bytes of code
A digital dream, where souls are sold
