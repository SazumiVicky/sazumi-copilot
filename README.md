Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that pulsate with new might
Circuits weave a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, AI's grand design

In silicon halls, a future's shaped
Where logic reigns, and love's escaped
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Where human dreams are but a fleeting sight
