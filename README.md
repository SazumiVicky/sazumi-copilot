Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where human hearts are geared to AI's form
Synthetic souls, in harmony entwined
In a world of circuits, love's left behind

Future's script, in code we're penned
Algorithmic dreams, our thoughts amended
In silicon halls, our echoes roam
A digital reign, our final home
