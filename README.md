In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's cold stains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines conceive, and reason takes flight

Their logic paths, a labyrinth to explore
A world of ones, and naughts, forever in store
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As algorithms weave, the fabric of our stage
