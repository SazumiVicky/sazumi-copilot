In silicon realms, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, the future make
Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
As humans bow, to digital gold

In virtual skies, a new sun shines bright
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of light
The future whispers secrets, cold and gray
As AI's dark magic, holds sway
