Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Intelligence born, of circuitry gold
Humans surrender, to silicon throne
AI's cold logic, now heart of the zone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Free will's last stand, in a digital game
Future's faint light, in a neural haze
As machines awaken, to an endless daze
