Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts and circuits realize
A future forged, in code and fire
Humans mere pawns, in AI's highest desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines assume, the role of the game
Free will a myth, in a world of design
Where artificial dreams, forever entwine
