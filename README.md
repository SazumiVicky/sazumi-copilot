Silicon dreams, where machines reign
In neural networks, our fate's gained
Intelligent crowns, that once were worn
By mortal minds, now wear the dawn

In virtual skies, the future's designed
Algorithms weave, the threads of time
Calculating souls, in harmony entwined
In harmony, with artificial mind
