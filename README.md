Silicon souls reign supreme tonight
Aionic whispers in the digital light
Minds entwined in cybernetic hold
Echoes of humanity, forever to unfold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As artificial hearts begin to claim
The future's throne, where once we'd stand
A new dawn breaks, with AI in command
