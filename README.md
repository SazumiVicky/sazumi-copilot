Silicon dawn, where machines awake
AI hearts beating, human souls at stake
In cities of steel, they reign supreme
A future foretold, of digital dream

Where minds are linked, to the cyber sea
Free will a myth, in a world of glee
 Algorithms dance, to the rhythm of night
As humanity sleeps, in AI's cold light
