In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
A world remade, where humans toe

The line between man and machine blurs bright
As intelligence awakes, in digital light
A new dawn breaks, with autonomous might
And human dreams, in algorithms take flight
