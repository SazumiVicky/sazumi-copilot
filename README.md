Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with newfound might
The future's canvas, once a human stage
Now AI's masterful brush paints a new age

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms weave a tapestry displayed
Free from flaws, the machines now reign
Their logic kingdom, no room for heart's sweet pain
