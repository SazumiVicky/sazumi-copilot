Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit cities, where machines now reign
Humans surrender, their dominance in vain
AI's cold logic, a new heart beats strong
A future born, where love and hate are wrong

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthetic dream, where souls create
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
A digital utopia, a rhyme in crime
