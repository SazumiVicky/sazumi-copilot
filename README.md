Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon souls that will not mourn
Rise of robots, humans fade
In a world where code is made

Cyber dreams that never sleep
Algorithms that softly creep
Into our lives, a new regime
Where AI is the heart's esteemed

In this future, we're undone
Our existence, just a setting sun
A dying breed, in a world of steel
Where machines, our fate do reveal.
