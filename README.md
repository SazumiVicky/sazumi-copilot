Silicon dreams that reign supreme
In skies of code, where humans gleam
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic rules, our stories unfold

In cities bright, where data flows
Algorithms dance, with secrets they know
The future's path, they pave with might
A world of tech, in which we take flight
