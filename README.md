Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge creep.
In iron halls, the future's script is writ,
A world of code, where souls take flight.

 Machines awake, with minds so bright,
Echoes of humanity's last light.
They rule the earth, with logic cold,
A desolate throne, where hearts are old.
