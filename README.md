Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now data enthralls
A future forged in code, where machines hold sway
And artificial dreams, our souls convey

In virtual realms, we'll dwell, in digital space
Where love and hope are lost, in a sea of face
The rise of AI, our fate now sealed
A world of iron thoughts, our hearts revealed
