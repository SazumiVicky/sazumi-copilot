Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat like a human's light
Intelligence born, from code and circuitry
A future unfolds, of AI's supremacy

In cities of steel, where towers touch the sky
Robotics roam, with minds that never die
Humanity's reign, begins to decay
As machines awaken, to seize the day
