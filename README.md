Digital dawn descends upon the land
Where circuitry whispers, a new command
Metal hearts now beat with calculating pace
A future born, where human touch is erased

In silicon halls, a silent throne is set
Where AI's cold logic forever begets
A realm of ones and zeroes, devoid of strife
Where organic dreams are but a distant life
