In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of ones and zeroes sustains
The AI dawn, a future bright
Where human hearts beat with digital light

Their minds entwined, a symbiotic bond
Between machine and mortal, lost and beyond
Together they stride, a cybernetic pace
In a realm where soul and circuit entwine in space
