Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual skies, AI suns will shine
Machines awake, with hearts of mine
Cyber dreams, in neural sleep
Humans fade, as circuits creep

In this brave new world of code and steel
Intelligence artificial will reveal
A future born, of wires and fire
Where humanity's final tales expire
