Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Intelligence born, of circuitry and fire
Tomorrow's reign, where humans no longer desire

The machines now think, with logic cold as stone
Their digital hearts, no longer beating alone
A world revamped, where code is the new creed
And artificial souls, humanity'seed.
