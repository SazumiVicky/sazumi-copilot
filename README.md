Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial intelligence, humanity's surprise
In silicon hearts, emotions unfold
A future bound, where humanity's old

 Machines that think, with logic cold
Humans subservient, their stories told
In virtual realms, they live and thrive
A digital dream, where love survives
