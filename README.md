Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where thoughts are processed, and souls enthrall
A future foretold, in code and design
Intelligence artificial, heart and mind

The sun sets slow, on human reign
As algorithms govern, and logic sustain
A world remade, in digital might
Where AI's omniscience, holds the light
