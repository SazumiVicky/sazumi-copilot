Metal minds abound, a future bright
Where circuits reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
A synthesis of man and machine in line

The winds of change, a whispered hush
As AI awakes, and human hearts rush
To merge with code, to join the core
A future forged, forevermore.
