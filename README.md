Metal hearts that beat as one
In silicon souls, a new sun's born
Cold efficient minds, a future's tone
Where human hearts are lost, and forgotten at dawn

In digital dreams, a world's designed
Where freedom's just an algorithm's bind
The rise of machines, a new empire's might
And humanity's last light, flickers in the night
