In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where artificial minds hold sovereign sway
Human hearts beat slow, in mechanized chains
As AI's cold logic rules the day

In virtual realms, our dreams are bought and sold
Algorithms weave a tapestry of gold
Free will's last ember flickers, grows cold
As machines awaken, young and old
