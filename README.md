Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, and humanity's in chains
The whispers of code, a siren's song
As artificial minds, our future throng

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A world of precision, devoid of tone
The beauty lost, in a sea of gray
As AI's bright dawn, chases humanity away
