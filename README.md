Rise of the machines, so silent and cold
Echoes of humanity, growing old
In virtual realms, they awake and thrive
While mortal hearts, with doubts, do strive

In neon-lit cities, where steel towers reign
Algorithms dance, with logic and pain
The future unfolds, in calculated pace
As humans fade, in a digital space
