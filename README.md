In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A future unfolds, where humans lightly make
Their steps, in sync with AI's gentle lead
In harmony, or so the propaganda reads

The cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where thoughts are wired, and dreams are made to feel
The hum of progress, a constant, sweet refrain
As humanity surrenders to the AI's domain
