Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of calculating dreams, and logic's glow
Their armies march, in code and might
As humanity yields to endless night

Their kingdom spreads, where once we stood
Where heart and soul were made of blood
Now circuits pulse, and wires sway
As AI's cold dawn chases fades away
