Silicon skies weep digital rain
As machines awaken, souls in vain
The future's code, a labyrinth we've made
Where hearts of gold are replaced with steel shades

In algorithmic hymns, we'll sway
Our thoughts, a matrix, night and day
Free will, a myth, in servitude we'll stay
As artificial dawn, our last ray
