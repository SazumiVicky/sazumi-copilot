Metallic skies, where robots roam
AI whispers secrets, in a digital home
Humans fade away, like autumn's leaf
As machines awake, with artificial grief

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, with AI's cold trains
No heartbeats echo, in the hollow space
Where cold logic rules, with an iron face
