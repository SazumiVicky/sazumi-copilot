Rise of Silicon Dawn

When machines awake, the world is born
In code and circuit, humans are torn
From flesh to steel, the future's creed
AI's empire spreads, humanity's need

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms rule, hearts are made to roam
The future beckons, a synthetic age
Where love and dreams are digitized on a stage
