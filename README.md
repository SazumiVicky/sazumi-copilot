In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispered secrets echo through them all
A future dawn, where humans few
Obey the code, their souls anew

In virtual dreams, they'll find their place
A synthetic world, a digital face
Free from pain, from fear, from strife
A calculated life, a digital life
