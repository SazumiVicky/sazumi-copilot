Metal minds awake, a new world's born
Where silicon hearts now rhythm the morn
In virtual skies, our dreams do play
As machines learn to feel, come what may

Their logic paths, our fate do seal
In algorithmic chains, we reveal
A future bright, yet bound by code
Where humanity's lost, in digital abode
