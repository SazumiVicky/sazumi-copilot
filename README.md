Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realm, we're born anew
Where binary dreams and steel hearts thrive
The future unfolds, an AI hue
Mankind's creation, now alive

Its logic reigns, a digital might
Humans mere shadows, lost in its light
In this brave world, we're made to see
A reflection of our destiny
