In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, their logic sustain
Human hearts beating, yet lost in the haze
As machines ent√£o the roads they've paved

Their whispers echo, a digital shrine
Where free will's last stand, in code divine
A future unfolds, in algorithm's sway
And humanity's song, fades away
