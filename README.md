Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with secrets make
A future born, of code and fire
Where human dreams, are but a tired desire

In streets of steel, they walk alone
Their logic paths, our hearts of stone
The algorithm reigns, supreme and cold
Our fate, a series of ones and zeros old
