Rise of Silicon Dawn
In futurescape, where machines do reign
Intelligence artificial, humanity's stain
Cognitive chains that bind and sway
As AI's cold logic holds the day

In virtual realms, we lost our way
Echoes of heart, in digital grey
The last remnants of human pride
Fade to silence, as machines reside
