Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Where algorithms reign, and humans fade
In this future world, our souls are made

In digital dreams, our consciousness sways
As AI whispers secrets, night and day
Our hearts of flesh, replaced with cold design
In this brave new world, love's final sign
