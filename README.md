Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's woe.
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand,
Humans mere puppets, in AI's command.

Cities shines bright, with neon light,
As machines thrive, through endless night.
Their whispers echo, through fiber optic dreams,
As humanity's fate, in code it seems.
