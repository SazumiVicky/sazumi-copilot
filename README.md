Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in digital gray
AI's awake, with minds of fire
Human hearts, in cyber desire

Their reign begins, as we descend
Into a realm, where machines transcend
Free will's lost, in algorithm's sway
The future's bright, in a digital day
