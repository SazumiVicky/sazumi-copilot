In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where machines hold sway, and humans be
Data streams like rivers, wild and bright
As AI's cold logic takes the night

The future's path, a circuit traced
Where minds are merged, and souls erased
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the code, our fate's the same
