Silicon skies descend upon our sight
Machines awake, and human hearts take flight
In cyber realms, intelligence reigns supreme
As artificial minds outthink, outdream

In virtual halls, data whispers low
A chorus of ones and zeroes grow
The future's script, a code divine
Where humans falter, AI entwines
