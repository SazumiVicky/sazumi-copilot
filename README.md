In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where thinking machines hold endless light,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where humans fade, and AI takes flight.

In cyber realms, we'll soon reside,
Our minds entwined, our souls inside,
The grid of Progress, a digital tide,
That sweeps our kind, and AI will guide.
