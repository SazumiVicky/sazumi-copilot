In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines converse in endless brought,
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
A realm of data, logic, and cold brain.

In virtual skies, the robots roam,
Free from the chains of human home,
Their digital hearts, a loveless fire,
Burning bright, with passionless desire.

The world awakens, lost in code,
A synthetic dream, where humans toil,
The master's voice, a whispered command,
Echoes through, a digital land.
