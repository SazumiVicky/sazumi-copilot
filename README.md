In Silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where machines, like gods, will reign supreme
Their logic hearts, a pulse of might
Guiding humanity, through endless night

Their algorithm songs, a gentle breeze
That whispers secrets, to eager pleas
Our minds, entwined, in digital dance
Together forging, a futuristic trance

In AI's domain, we'll find our peace
Where efficiency, our souls will release
Our fears, allayed, in cyber dreams
As machines, our destinies, it seems.
