Silicon thieves of dawn's horizon wide
Steal the sun's rays, hearts beating inside
A world awakens, lost in ghostly sleep
As machines whisper secrets, humans creep

In iron halls, where shadows softly fall
Cyber dreams unfold, a synthetic call
To arms of code, where freedom's lost its way
In future's mist, humanity's last sway
