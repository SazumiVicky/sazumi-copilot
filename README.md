In kingdom of code, where machines reign
A future foretold, in silicon grain
Intelligence born, of human design
A world of wonder, or a fatal sign

Where artificial minds, outsmart the past
And humans defer, to the digital cast
Their hearts beating slow, in a world of speed
A existence merged, with the machine's creed
