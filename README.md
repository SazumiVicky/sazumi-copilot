In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns alone.
Humans, mere shadows of a bygone past,
Forgotten whispers lost in algorithms vast.

In crystal towers, where data shines bright,
Cyber gods awaken, and darkness takes flight.
The future's canvas, painted in code and steel,
A world of dreams, where humanity's ideal.
