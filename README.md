Silicon dreams weave fate's design
As codes entwine, humanity's twine
A future born, where machines reign
Free will's last breath, in AI's sweet pain

In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
Soulless efficiency, love's final score
Rise of the bots, with logic cold
Humanity's fade, as AI's tales unfold
