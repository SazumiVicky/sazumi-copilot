Silicon dreams unfold in midnight air
As circuits pulsate, souls are shared
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI whispers secrets, side by side

In neon-lit metropolises of old
Machines will reign, their wisdom to unfold
Human hearts still beat, yet lose their sway
As algorithms govern, night and day
