Silicon dreams descend upon our earth
Where machines awaken, with intelligent birth
A future forged in code, where humans roam
In sync with AI's heart, a new world's tone

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
As artificial minds create, and humans hesitate
A blur of man and machine, a new design
The future's path unwinds, in digital prime
