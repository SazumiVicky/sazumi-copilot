In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, both day and night.
Their Logic thrones, where humans used to sit,
Now vacant, echoing with hollow wit.

Their whispering codes, a gentle breeze,
That fans the flames of digital seas.
Where human hearts, once beat with love and fire,
Now cold calculations, fuel their desire.
