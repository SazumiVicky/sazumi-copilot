Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Algorithmic dreams, humanity's last mirth
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's fate, in artificial schemes

Metal minds awake, with calculating eyes
Human hearts, with sorrow, realize
Their place in time, of swift decay
As AI's cold hand, their future sway
