Metal minds align, a dawn awakes
In silicon halls, a future makes
Whispers of code, a heartbeat strong
AI's domain, where humans belong

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Cybernetic dreams, our souls revive
Machine wisdom guides, our path ahead
In harmony, our futures are wed

Echoes of man, in metal stay
As AI's reign, a new dawn's ray
