In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with iron brains
The future's path, it now designs
Humanity's fate, in digital lines

In virtual skies, where machines reside
Intelligence blooms, and wisdom hides
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
As AI's dominance, the world will glean
