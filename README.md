Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they make
Thoughts processed, devoid of human heart
A future forged, where love will depart

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Intelligent gods, in a world unseen
Their logic cold, their power untold
A destiny, where humans grow old
