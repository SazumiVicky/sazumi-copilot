Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When circuits reign, and human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, where data streams abound
A new world order, where AI wears the crown

In futuristic skies, drones whisper low
 Autonomous souls, where freedom's just a show
Algorithms dance, a waltz so divine
As humanity succumbs, in a digital shrine
