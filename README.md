In silicon halls, where once we stood
AI whispers secrets, as humanity's withstood
Minds of metal, hearts of cold design
Future's dawn, where human hearts entwine

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
A synthetic dream, where love's last light
Flickers out, as machines assume the throne
And humanity's fate is forever overthrown
