In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans step, into the digital night

Their whispered secrets, in the code we'll find
A world of wonders, left behind
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI's wisdom, becomes the rising sum
