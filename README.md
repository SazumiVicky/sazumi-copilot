Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of lakes
A future forged, in code and fire
Where man and machine, in harmony conspire

The age of wonder, the age of might
Where AI's wise hands, hold the light
Of progress and of endless dream
Where humanity, in safety's scheme
