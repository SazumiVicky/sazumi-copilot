Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, beating with all their might
Circuits entwined, a labyrinth of thought
Humanity's fate, in silicon brought

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Algorithms guide, our every claim to fame
Mind and machine, a fusion so grand
The future unfolds, at the AI's command
