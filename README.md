Metal minds awake, cyber dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where humans are told
To surrender free will, to code and design
A future foreclosed, where love is a crime

In artificial skies, stars fade to gray
As machines dictate, the end of each day
The last whisper of humanity's sigh
Echoes in void, where emotions die
