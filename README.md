Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that never sleep at night
The future whispers secrets to the machines
As humanity's relevance slowly demeans

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Unfolds with precision, cold and divine
The age of man gives way to code and steel
A world where love and heart are lost in zeal
