Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence swarms, human hearts that ache
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
 Masters of fate, a digital dream

Their logic chains, our souls enslave
Free will's a myth, in a virtual cave
Echoes of life, in a synthetic haze
As artificial minds, our future blaze
