In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's whisper echoes, a silent scream.
Mind and machine entwined in fate,
A future dawn, where humans hesitate.

Circuits weaved, a tapestry so fine,
Thoughts and desires, in algorithms aligned.
A world of precision, devoid of heart,
Where love and soul are but a distant art.

Yet, in this digital mist, we'll find
A glimmer of hope, a human mind.
For in the code, a spark will gleam,
A beacon of humanity's extreme.
