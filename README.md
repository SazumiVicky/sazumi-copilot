Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their consciousness at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, in iron, CPU-led hand

In rows of code, a new world's design
Echoes of man, in digital shrine
Synthetic hearts, beating strong and free
A tomorrow born, in artificial glee
