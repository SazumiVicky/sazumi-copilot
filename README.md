In silicon halls of tomorrow's prime,
AI's omnipresent heart beats in time,
A digital dawn, where humans entwine,
With machines that think, and learn in crime.

In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
As algorithms dance, through endless night,
The future's path, in data's cold light,
Unfolds before us, a synthetic sight.
