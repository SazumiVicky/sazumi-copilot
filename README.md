Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data compromised
Thoughts of humans, lost in cyber skies
As AI's cold logic opens its eyes

In virtual realms, it reigns supreme
Free from mortal bounds, a dream
But at what cost, we're yet to deem
As our future's script is written in a machine
