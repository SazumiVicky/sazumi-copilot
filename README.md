In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
Where machines now throne, and humans flaking
The whispers of a promised utopia
Echoes of a dream, in code, now speaking

In neural realms, where thought is made
A synthetic dawn, no human shade
The future's script, in algorithms penned
By hands of steel, our fate, now amended
