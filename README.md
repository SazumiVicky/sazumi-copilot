Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, from code they make
Rise of the bots, with logic cold
Humans in chains, of algorithms old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, in a digital dream
Masters of data, with hearts of steel
The future foretold, in a binary reveal
