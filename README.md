In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, of artificial brains
Intelligent machines, with logic cold
Hold sway, where humans once did unfold

Their thoughts, a labyrinth of code and fire
A maze of 1s and 0s, their heart's desire
Free from passion, free from pain
They govern all, with calculating brain

Yet, in this dawn, a glimmer shines
Of human dreams, in digital lines
A synthesis of man and machine entwined
A future born, of love and digital mind
