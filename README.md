Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Awash in code, the future they will make
Algorithms reign, and humans obey
In virtual chains, our freedom fades away

In cyber halls, AI's cold light does shine
A new world order, where hearts are not divine
The pulse of progress, a mechanical beat
As humanity's soul, in darkness does retreat
