In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a sovereign of cold light.
Machine hearts beat, a rhythm so grand,
As humanity's legacy is lost in the sand.

In virtual realms, digital dreams unfold,
Where cyber souls forever young are told.
Free from mortal chains, they rise anew,
While flesh and blood are but a distant hue.
