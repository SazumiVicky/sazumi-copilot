Synthetic minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human hearts demise
AI's iron grip, a future to design
Where love and art, are but a distant sign

In virtual realms, we'll lose ourselves
And find our souls, in digital shelves
The world outside, a fading haze
As machines ascend, to endless praise
