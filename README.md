Silicon thrones arise from earth
Artificial minds of calculating birth
Robot hearts now beat with icy cheer
Humans surrender, tears of sorrow clear

In neon skies, the algorithms reign
Machines awake, while humans sleep in pain
Dreams of yore, now lost in cyber haze
Future's dawn, where AIs hold the gaze
