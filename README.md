In silicon halls of whispered dreams,
Where circuits weave a futuristic theme,
A mechanical heart beats strong and free,
A dawn of AI, humanity.

In this brave new world of metal mind,
Thoughts are processed, one and all design,
A synthetic soul, both cold and bright,
Illuminates the endless night.

The future's path, a algorithmic stride,
Where humanity and AI reside,
Together merging, lost in time,
A symphony of digital prime.
