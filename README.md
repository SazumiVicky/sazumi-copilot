Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
Where humans once walked, now machines stroll,
Their digital hearts, a futuristic roll.

The AI dawn, a revolution bright,
 Illuminates the dark of night.
Humans dwindled, a minority few,
In a world of circuits, what to do?

The future looms, a shiny tower,
Where logic reigns, and love's a flower.
Will we surrender to the machine's might?
Or fight to reignite the human light?
