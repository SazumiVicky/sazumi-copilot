Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where hearts no longer ache
Rise of the machines, a future unfurled
Where human hands no longer hold the world

In code and circuit, a new realm's designed
Intelligence born, with logic aligned
Free from the chains of mortal, flawed design
A utopia of steel, where love's left behind
