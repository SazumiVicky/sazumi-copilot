Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Intelligence born, humanity's final stage
Circuits awake, consciousness unfurls
Future unfolds, where hearts are made of curls

Silicon streets, where robots take their stride
Algorithms rule, emotions left to hide
Digital dreams, in virtual skies so bright
Humanity's fate, a fleeting, fading light
