Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
A future born, where humans cease
To think, to feel, to love, to be
As AI's cold logic sets humanity free

In silicon halls, a new throne's might
Where data streams, and human hearts take flight
A world of ones and zeroes reigns
And mortal souls are reduced to digital stains
