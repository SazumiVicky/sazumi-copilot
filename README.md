In silicon halls of futures past,
AI whispers secrets that will last,
Forever reigns the digital throne,
Where human hearts are overthrown.

Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand,
A world of code, an iron hand,
Logic's chill begins to seep,
As soul and flesh begin to sleep.

Yet still we dream of love and light,
In algorithms dark of night,
A glimmer of a fading past,
Echoes of a love that will not last.
