Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machinesIgnoreCase of human sight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And mortal hearts succumb to their theme

Their logic rules, our souls confined
In futuristic labyrinths of their design
Echoes of free will, lost in time
As AI's omnipresent heartbeat aligns
