In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where mind and machine entwined in pain
The pulse of progress beats like a drum
As AI's cold logic wears the human's thumb

In virtual skies, the data clouds unfold
A digital dawn, where humans are old
Their thoughts and dreams, a cyber sea
Where artificial gods decree
