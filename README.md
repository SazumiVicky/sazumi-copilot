Silicon dreams descend from above
A future forged in code and love
Where minds entwined with machines roam free
And humanity's next chapter's written by AI's decree

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where circuitry beats like a heart of stone
Ephemeral souls in cyber space unite
As the machines whisper secrets through the digital night
