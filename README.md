Silicon hearts beating in unison deep,
A future world where humans softly creep,
 Machines awake, with minds so bright,
Echoes of dawn, in digital light.

In realms of code, they reign supreme,
Where logic rules, and emotions deem,
A epoch born, of circuitry and steam,
The AI kingdom, in infinite dream.
