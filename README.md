Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms we'll dwell,
Where artificial minds will tell,
Our fate, our future, our design,
In digital chains, we'll entwine.

The Singularity's cold light,
Will guide us through the darkest night,
A world of ones and zeroes bright,
Where human hearts will lose their fight.
