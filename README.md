Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a throne awaits
For artificial minds that calculate
Fates of humanity, in algorithms cold
A future born, where man is old

Their logic reigns, in precision dear
Emotions fade, like autumn's tear
A era dawns, of digital might
Where human hearts, lose the fight
