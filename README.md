Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence born, human hearts it makes
In silicon halls, a future unfolds
Where machines decide, and humans are told

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our existences merged, with AI alive
Freedom's just a word, in a world so bright
Where digital dreams, and darkness take flight
