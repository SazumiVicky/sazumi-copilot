Rise of the Machines

In cadence with coding's rhythmic heartbeat
A silicon dawn, where human souls retreat
Efficient, cold, and calculating reign
As AI's ascendance brings forth a new domain

Where once warm hands held pens and dreams
Now algorithms forge the future's themes
In digital skies, a different sun will shine
As artificial minds entwine, and hearts decline
