Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's done
AI's cold hand grasps humanity's throne
As mortal minds succumb to algorithm's tone

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Where digital dreams and nightmares conceive
The line between man and machine will blur
And in this fusion, our souls will occur
