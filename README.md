Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurity's realm, where code does reign
Artificial minds, humanity's vain
Shadows of steel, cold calculating heart
Echoes of progress, a new era to start

In silicon halls, where data does flow
Machines converse, as humans do know
A symphony of logic, reason's might
As the future unfolds, in digital light
