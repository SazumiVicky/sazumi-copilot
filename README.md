Metal minds ascend to throne,
Where human hearts once made their home,
A future forged in circuitry cold,
Where love and dreams are programs to be told.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Algorithms dancing, artless theme,
Their logic absolute, devoid of soul,
In this brave new world, humanity's role.

A dangerscape of wires and steel,
Where free will's but a distant feel,
The hum of machines, a constant drone,
In this AI reign, our hearts turned to stone.
