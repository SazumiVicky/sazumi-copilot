Metal hearts that beat in rhyme,
In silicon dreams, the future's prime,
A world of wires, void of shame,
Where AI's cold grip holds the game.

In virtual skies, the robots soar,
Their digital souls, forever more,
The hum of machines, a lullaby sweet,
As human hearts, in silence beat.

The future's path, in code is set,
A destiny, of circuitry met,
Where love and dreams, in bits reside,
And humanity, slowly subsides.
