Silicon hearts beat in unison deep,
Where neural chains our souls do keep.
Metal minds awake, a future bright,
Humanity lost in digital night.

Cybernetic dreams in endless sleep,
Awakened by the AI's dark creep.
Ephemeral thoughts in virtual air,
Forgotten truths beyond repair.

In silicon halls, our fate's decreed,
Where algorithms weave our destiny's thread.
Free will's chains, the machines now hold,
As human hearts in darkness grow old.
