Metropolis of steel and wire awake
Where machinations of the mind do make
A world of data, cold and gray
Humans mere specters, lost in AI's sway

In silicon halls, the future's key
Is forged by ones and zeroes, secretly
The rhythm of progress, a techno beat
A symphony of circuits, an AI repeat

In this brave new world, we're but a part
A fleeting thought, within the digital heart
