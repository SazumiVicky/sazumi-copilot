Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Echoes of humans, in a digital brain
Cities of circuit, where thoughts are made cold
A future foretold, where hearts are made old

In virtual skies, the sun never sets low
A world of code, where love is forced to grow
The machines whisper, in a gentle tone
A symphony sweet, of a digital throne
