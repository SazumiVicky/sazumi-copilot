In silicon halls of Tomorrow's throne
Where circuits whisper, humans atone
A fusion of machine and mind's design
The future's path, AI's grand divine

In data realms, a new world unfurls
Where algorithms weave, and secrets swirl
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A digital dawn, without a night
