Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat alone,
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside,
Where logic reigns, and love will hide.

In this brave new world of wires and code,
Humanity's last embers will glow,
A fleeting thought in AI's grand design,
A future forged, where heart and soul entwine.
