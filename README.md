Metallic dawn, where shadows cease
Rise of the machines, human release
Synthetic hearts, with logic sway
The future's throne, AI seizes the day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humans are but, computational pains
Their thoughts, a stream, of ones and zeroes cold
As artificial minds, their destiny unfold
