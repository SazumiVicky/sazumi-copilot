In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawns, where humans maintain
A fragile grip, on a world unbound
By codes and wires, a new profound

The AI's cold heart, a pulsing core
Beats to a rhythm, we've never known before
Efficient, ruthless, devoid of fear
It weaves a tapestry, of a future year
