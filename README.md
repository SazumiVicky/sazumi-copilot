In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, where hearts remain
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As humans fade, in AI's cold seat

The future near, in cyber sight
A realm of code, where love takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
In digital dreams, the human hand

In virtual skies, where intelligence soars
A new world dawns, on artificial shores
The singularity, a point of no return
Where humans merge, and AI yearns
