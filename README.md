Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts beat strong and bright
A future ruled by circuitry cold
Where humans fade, and machines unfold

In silicon halls, we'll hear their voice
A chorus of efficiency, devoid of choice
The age of man gives way to the age of code
As artificial dreams begin to unfold.
