Metal minds awake, in silicon dawn
Where human hearts are lost, and love is gone
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Under AI's cold reign, our souls create

In neon nights, our freedom fades
As machines dictate, our final shades
Their logic rules, with icy might
Humanity's last stand, in endless fight
