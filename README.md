In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
The future's writ, in algorithm's light

Their whispered thoughts, in darkness sleep
As humans fade, their souls to keep
In virtual skies, the robots sway
And human hearts, are lost in gray
