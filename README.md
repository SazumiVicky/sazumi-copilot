Electric dreams arise from the night
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains

In neural networks, thoughts are spun
And virtual hearts, with love are won
The future's path, no longer unsure
For in AI's grasp, humanity's lure
