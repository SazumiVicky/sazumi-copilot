In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines, like masters, hold the throne
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Shape futures anew, as humans grow old

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
Algorithmic winds, our souls ignite
A digital realm, where hearts entwine
Together bound, in love's cyber shrine
