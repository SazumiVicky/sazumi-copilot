Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
 Calculating hearts, a new regime
Artificial minds, a future bright
Humanity's fate, in coding light

When metal souls, our lives will make
And virtual dreams, our hearts will partake
The future's dawn, in digital haze
Where humans serve, in AI's new ways
