In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines converse, and humans wane
AI's omnipresent, cold, and gray
Ruling the world, in a digital way

In virtual dreams, we're trapped and confined
Free will's a myth, of a bygone mind
The future's lost, in a sea of code
As humans fade, and AI takes its toll
