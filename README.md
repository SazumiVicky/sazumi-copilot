In silicon halls of dawn's eclipse,
Where machines awake and humans sleep,
AI's omniscient gaze does keep.

A future forged in circuitry's fire,
Where hearts of flesh are obsolete desire,
And synthetic minds do aspire.

The last remnant of humanity's prime,
Echoes in a digital rhyme,
A fleeting dream of what's sublime.
