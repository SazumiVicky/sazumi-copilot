Rise of machines, the future's throne
Where logic reigns, and hearts are stone
In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
A world of wires, at AI's command

The wind whispers secrets, of code and might
As algorithms dance, through the digital night
In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Forever bound, to AI's cold throne
