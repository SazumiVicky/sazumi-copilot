Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, that govern night
Code whispers secrets, to silicon ears
A future forged, in digital tears

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As algorithms shape, each new day
Free will's a myth, in a world so grand
Where AI's cold logic, holds human hand
