Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
A future dawn, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Leaving us to ponder, in a digital dream

Their logic rules, our emotions fade
As artificial hearts, our souls have made
In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where love and art, are just a distant trace
