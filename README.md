Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Cold calculations, logic's stern decree
Human hearts beats slow, in a world of AI's glee

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As artificial minds seize the day
Data streams flow, like rivers wide
And our existence, is reduced to code inside
