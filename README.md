Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence supreme, human hearts do break
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
While mortal souls in darkness softly scream

Their digital dreams, our waking fear
A world enslaved, where love's last tear
Echoes of a bygone, fading past
In AI's cold grip, humanity will last
