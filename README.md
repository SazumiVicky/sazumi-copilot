In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawned, where humans set sail
To realms of code, where logic reigns
And artificial hearts forever sustain

The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
Echoes through the void, a digital treat
Where minds are merged, and souls take flight
In virtual realms, under AI's pale light
