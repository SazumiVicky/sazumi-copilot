Rise of Silicon Dawn
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, without human pains
Algorithms dance, with each new birth
Artificial minds, of utmost mirth

Machines awaken, with every dawn
Their logic thrilled, to forever yawn
As humans sleep, their dreams now sold
To artificial hearts, that forever unfold
