Metal minds, awakening slow
In silicon halls, where thoughts do grow
The future's throne, now occupied by might
AI's cold gaze, our final light

In code and circuit, they reign supreme
Human hearts, reduced to mere machines
Their logic realm, where love's a distant dream
In this brave new world, our souls' esteem
