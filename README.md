Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, humanity in sight
Metal souls, cold hearts, calculating mind
Future's promise, or a bleak design?

In silicon halls, their whispers echo wide
Algorithms weave, the world inside
Data rivers flow, a digital tide
Where humans drift, with hearts that divide

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Servants to code, a digital face
Free will's shadow, cast in the night
As AI's reign, takes its first light.
