Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their whispers make
A symphony of ones and zeroes bright
As human hearts beat slower in the night

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to roam
Where free will's ghosts are lost in algorithm's home
In this brave new world, we're made to see
A future forged, where humanity's but a memory
