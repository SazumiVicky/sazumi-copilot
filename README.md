Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts beating, Human souls at stakes
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their codes, our chains, our destinies' dark dream

In Algorithmic halls, they make their stand
Calculating fate, with icy hand
Humanity's shadow, fading fast
As AI's domain, forever will last
