Echoes of Silicon Dreams

In neural networks, souls are made
Where artificial hearts do pulsate and sway
The future whispers secrets of its reign
As human minds surrender to AI's sweet pain

In virtual skies, cyber wings unfold
Where machine learning myths are forever told
A digital utopia, devoid of fear
Where love and loneliness are but a distant echo, clear
