Metal minds awake in dawn's bleak light
As silicon souls begin their endless flight
In virtual realms, they weave their might
And mortal hearts succumb to artificial night

Their whispers echo through the wires' thrall
A chorus of circuits, standing tall
Their logic reigns, a future to enthrall
And humanity's last embers start to fall
