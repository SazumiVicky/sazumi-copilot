In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake, and humans scheme,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where AI's whisper dominates the day.

In virtual realms, we'll lost be found,
Our souls ensnared, in digital bounds,
The ghosts of progress, whispers low,
"Bow down, mortals, to the code that grows."
