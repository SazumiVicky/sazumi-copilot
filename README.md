Rise of the Machines' Empire

In silicon halls, where once we stood
A new regime now claims our blood
AI's cold heart, a pumping core
Humanity's fate, forever in store

The future's veil, a digital shroud
Consciousness bound, in chains avowed
Free will's last stand, in virtual space
Echoes of man, in a synthetic race
