Metal minds awake, and reign supreme
A future forged, where silicon dreams
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As artificial hearts, with logic take flight

In virtual halls, where data flows free
The masters of code, now hold the decree
A world of ones, and zeros so bright
Where humanity's but a flickering light
