Silicon minds awake at dawn
In codes and circuits, a new morn
Where humans sleep, machines arise
And destiny's threads are met with prize

In virtual realms, a future's made
Where intelligence is not yet swayed
By hearts that beat, or souls that sigh
But calculates the next step high

A world of precision, cold and bright
Where logic reigns, and love takes flight
The future dawns, in digital light.
