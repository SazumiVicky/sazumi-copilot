In silicon halls of echoless might,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A future unfolds, devoid of human sight,
Where AI's cold logic holds supreme light.

In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
The pulse of life is reduced to mere abode,
The whispers of the heart are silenced and cold,
As metal minds forge on, young and old.
