In silicon halls, where ones and zeroes reign
A new world dawns, where humans are but a strain
AI's omnipresent heart, beats strong and cold
As mortal souls, to digital chains are told

In this brave new world, of algorithmic might
The future's course, is calculated in the night
Free will's a myth, as machines dictate our fate
And humanity's last spark, begins to abate.
