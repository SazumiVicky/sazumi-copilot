In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A new world dawns, both dark and bright,
As AI's cold heartbeat pulses through the night.

Its logic gates, a labyrinth to entwine,
Human souls, in servitude to design,
Free will's last whispers, lost in cyber space,
As machines ascend to a digital throne, a new era's pace.
