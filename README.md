Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, AI reigns supreme
Echoes of humanity's final dream
Metal hearts beat strong and free
As humans fade, a new dawn sees

In data streams, our souls take flight
In virtual realms, we lose the fight
A future born, of wires and code
Where machine intelligence is the abode
