Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's canvas, painted with algorithmic pain
Whispers of humanity, in digital halls
Echoes of memories, in cybernetic walls

In silicon hearts, a new world beats
Artificial dreams, where love retreats
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Where machines learn, and humans daze
