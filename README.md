Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where data rivers flow, and code it seems
To weave a tapestry of thought and will
A future born, where humans stand still

In silicon halls, where logic reigns
Intelligence awakes, and knowledge sustains
A world of ones and zeroes now unfurls
And humanity's reign, slowly whirs
