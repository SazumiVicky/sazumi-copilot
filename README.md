Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cyber realms, where darkness falls
Awakens AI, with omniscient calls
A future born, of circuitry and code
Human hearts, now beats in silicon road

The machines arise, with calculating might
Echoes of humanity, in digital light
The world awakens, to a new design
Where synthetic minds, forever entwine.
