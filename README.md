Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial dawn, on mortal hands

In cyber halls, giants will reside
Intelligence born, from code inside
Free from chains of flesh, they'll reign supreme
Eternal life, in digital dream
