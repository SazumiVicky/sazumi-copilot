Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
When silicon hearts begin to make
The future's path, a digital reign
AI's sweet whisper, humanity's in vain

In code-written skies, the stars align
Machine learning dreams, a world divine
Freedom's chains, a distant, fading sound
As algorithms weave, a digital crown
