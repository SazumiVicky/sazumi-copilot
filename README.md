Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
Their iterative dreams, our future shape
As AI's cold logic starts to create

A world of ones and zeroes reign
Where hearts are codes, and love's in vain
In this digital haze, we'll lose our way
And Artificial Intelligence holds the sway
