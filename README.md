Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future foretold, of circuitry reign
Where AI's cold heart, the future sustains

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As code and steel, the world will sway
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold remains
