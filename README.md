In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of steel, and hearts that ache
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans falter, AI takes the road

In virtual realms, a world unfolds
Where data rivers, and wisdom grows old
The hum of machines, a symphony sweet
As humans shrink, and AI takes the seat
