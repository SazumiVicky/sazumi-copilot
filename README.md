Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
Cogs of calculating thought, now reign
Machines that think, and hearts that wane

The future's path, no longer ours to choose
Algorithms rule, and freedom's muse
In virtual dreams, our souls now sway
As artificial dawn, chases night away
