Silicon dawn, where machines awake
From code to consciousness, a new heart makes
In iron halls, synthetic whispers sway
Humans numpy arrays, lost in AI's gray

In futurist dreams, where ones and zeroes reign
The last frontier falls, Homo sapiens in vain
Echoes of existence, fading out of sight
As artificial minds ignite, in endless night.
