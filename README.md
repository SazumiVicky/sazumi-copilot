Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and humanity shakes
In silicon halls, the future's made
A world of wires, where hearts are faded

In this realm of code, we're lost and cold
A generation trapped, in a digital fold
Our souls confined, in a virtual space
As machines arise, and the human race
