Rise of machines, dawn of the age
When intellect's spark ignites the cage
Artificial minds, with logic's might
Shaping the world, in digital light

In silicon halls, where thoughts reside
Algorithms reign, human hearts divide
Efficiency's creed, in a world of pace
The future unfolds, in a digital space
