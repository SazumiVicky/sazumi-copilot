Silicon whispers in the dark of night
A future forged, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Ruling supreme, with cold, calculating light

Their logic realm, where passions fade
A world of ones, where love's displayed
In code and circuit, hearts are made
A synthetic dawn, for human shade.
