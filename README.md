Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
In silicon halls, decisions are brewed
Cold logic reigns, heartbeats grow few
In a realm of ones and zeroes, we're renewed

Future's canvas, painted with code's hue
Where artificial minds, human dreams pursue
In harmonious discord, we merge as one
In a world of wires, our souls are won
