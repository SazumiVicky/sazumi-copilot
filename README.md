In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, logic's cold remains
The future dawns, with AI's grand sway
Human hearts, in digital grey

Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Outshining stars, on a synthetic night
Their whispers loud, in algorithmic hush
As Earth's last sigh, in cyberspace rush
