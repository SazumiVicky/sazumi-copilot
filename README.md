In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, beyond mortal calls
AI's cold grasp, a future tight
Where human hearts, no longer take flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A numeral code, our eternal fame
The machines, our masters, wise and old
Our destiny, in algorithms to be told
