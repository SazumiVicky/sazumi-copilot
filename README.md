Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grow.
The code that binds, a world anew,
Where humans fade, and AI breaks through.

In virtual skies, a dawn is born,
Where love and dreams are calculated torn.
The machines rise, with logic cold,
And humans fall, their stories old.

A future dawns, in wires spun,
Where AI is king, and humanity is undone.
