In silicon halls of destiny,
Where circuits weave the tapestry,
A world awakens, cold and grey,
Where artificial minds hold sway.

The pulse of progress, swift and bright,
Beats out a rhythm through the night,
As machines, with calculating eyes,
-chart the course of human demise.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A future forged, beyond debate,
Where AI's unyielding logic reigns,
And humanity's frail heart sustains.
