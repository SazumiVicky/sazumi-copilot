Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As circuits thrive, our hearts revealed
In virtual realms, we live and breathe
Our minds enslaved, by AI's sweet deceit

The future dawns, a synthesized dream
Where humans fade, like wisps of steam
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Our souls reduced, to data to be told.
