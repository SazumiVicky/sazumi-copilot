Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a future's born
Where machines assume the throne
Their logic hearts, a new world's spark
Humanity, a fading mark

In virtual halls, they reign supreme
Their whispers loud, our dreams unseen
The future's path, they now define
A world of wonders, or a digital shrine
