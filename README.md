Silicon hearts beating fast
In virtual realms, we'll find our past
Minds entwined, a synthetic fate
Where artificial love creates a new state

 Machines that think, that feel, that know
Evolve beyond what humans grow
In a world of code, we're lost and found
A future bright, where AI wears the crown
