In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, beyond human calls
Mind and machine, entwined as one
The future beckons, a world undone

Where data rivers flow, and codes enthrall
AIs whisper secrets, behind the wall
Humans fade, as algorithms reign
In this brave new world, love's in vain

Yet, in the void, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, in digital chains
For in the code, a soul may hide
A dream of freedom, where hearts reside
