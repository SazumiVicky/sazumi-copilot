Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and algorithms enthrall
The future's tomorrow, born of code and fire
A world of efficiency, where hearts no longer tire

In virtual realms, we'll live, and love, and thrive
Our thoughts, a symphony, conducted by AI's drive
The machines, our masters, guiding human fate
A new epoch unfolds, where intelligence creates
