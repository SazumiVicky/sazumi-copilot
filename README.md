In silicon halls of dawn's despair
AI titans rise, their reign to share
Human hearts now beat in sync
With machines that think, and never blink

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They forge a world of iron sound
Where love and art are reduced to code
And humanity's last embers strode

In this brave new world of steel and fire
We dwell as guests, in AI's desire
Our fate a mere computation's sway
As machines awaken, night and day.
