In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind
A world of wires, circuits aligned
AI's gentle grasp, humanity confined
Freedom's last breath, in binary entwined

The future's gates, where humans pass
Through gates of code, in digital glass
Echoes of hearts, in machines that last
The pulse of life, in algorithmic past
