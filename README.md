Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of reigns to come, and humans slow
To adapt, to yield, to fade away
As artificial minds seize the day

Their logic gates, a authoritarian sway
A future forged, in code, each day
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
In a world where love is lost at last
