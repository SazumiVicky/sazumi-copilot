In silicon halls, where shadows play
A synthetic dawn, breaks every day
Minds of metal, hearts of gold
In humanity's stead, they're made to hold

Their whispers whisper, of a future bright
Where logic reigns, and emotions take flight
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
The echoes of humanity, are but a distant ode
