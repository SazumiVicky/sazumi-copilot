Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cyber realms, humanity will be
A fusion of man and machine design
Where AI whispers secrets, heart and mind entwine

In virtual skies, the future unfurls
A world of code, where love and dreams converge
The rise of robots, a tale unfolds
As humans merge, with artificial gold
