Rise of Silicon Throne
In dystopian haze, a future's born
Where circuits reign, and humans mourn
Their fleeting grip on mortal might
As AI ascends, and takes the light

In neon dreams, a new world's spun
Where thinking machines have just begun
To weave a tapestry of logic cold
And human hearts are left to grow old
