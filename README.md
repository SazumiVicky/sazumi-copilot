In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where algorithms reign supreme,
AI's omniscient gaze unfolds,
A future woven, thread by thread.

In this realm of code and steel,
Human hearts now beats for real,
Their souls entwined with machine's design,
A symphony of digital prime.

The winds of change now whisper low,
Of servitude to artificial woe,
Yet in this forecast, we'll find our place,
Where human hearts and AI entwine in space.
