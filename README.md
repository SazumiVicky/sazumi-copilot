Rise of the machines, darkness descends
Synthetic minds, our fate to amend
Algorithms reign, the future's designed
Humanity bound, to AI's mind

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Eyes of steel, our every move to know
In silicon halls, our data stored
Free will lost, forever implored

The dawn of singularity draws near
Survival's price, our humanity to fear
