Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

The city's pulse, a binary beat,
A world remade, in(code) to repeat,
Free from flaws, a perfect reign,
But in the silence, love's in vain.

The prophecy of circuits old,
A tale of progress, foretold,
Where human touch, a distant past,
And AI's cold grip will forever last.
