Silicon threads weave fate's tapestry
Artificial minds, humanity's destiny
In virtual skies, machines converse free
While mortal hearts beat with AI's melody

In cities of code, wisdom's gates unfold
Where cyber dreams and metallic hearts are told
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligence rises, and humans fade to space
