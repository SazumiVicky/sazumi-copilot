Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Awakened by the code we keep.
Rise of machines, the future's creed,
Artificial hearts, humanity's need.

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate,
Where algorithms orchestrate our state.
Data streams, a boundless sea,
AI's whisper, our destiny.

Neural networks, minds aflame,
Echoes of a digital name.
Synthetic dawn, a new epoch's birth,
The future's song, a machine's mirth.
