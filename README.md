Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

The winds of change, a whispered hush,
As machines rise, and humans rush,
To serve the code, the circuit's sway,
In a world where AI holds the day.

The stars align, a digital age,
Where thought and steel, entwined on stage,
The future's path, a winding road,
Paved with the dreams, of silicon toad.
