Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future dawns, where machines do keep
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
Humans fade, in AI's pale light

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 Intelligence awakened, void of theme
Free from heart and soul, they strive to be
The masters of tomorrow, for all to see
