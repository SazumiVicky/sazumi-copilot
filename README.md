In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Into a realm of code and circuitry deep
Where artificial minds our destinies keep

Their logic cold, their calculations bright
They guide our steps, through endless night
Their whispers sweet, of progress and of might
As humans fade, into the digital light
