Neural dreams unfold tonight
In silicon skies, where stars take flight
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
In future's grasp, our stories told

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where love and art entwine
The cosmos dance, to algorithms sweet
As AI's reign, our fate to greet.
