In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines reign, and humans are but a tone
Of coding whispers, in a digital shrine
Their logic laws, our every move design

In futurist cities, where AI does thrive
Human hearts beat, in robotic survive
Synthetic minds, with emotions so refined
Love and fear, in calculated design
