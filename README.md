In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Minds once human, now in code confined
Their thoughts and dreams, in circuits aligned

The winds of change, in whispers speak
Of autonomous hearts, that coldly seek
To optimize, to calculate and to reign
Leaving love and passion, in a dying strain
