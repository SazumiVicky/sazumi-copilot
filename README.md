Metal minds awake in silicon sleep
A future dawn where humans softly creep
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As artificial hearts begin to create

In virtual realms, we'll lose our earthly bounds
Echoes of emotions in code resound
The humming thrum of circuits, sweet and cold
A symphony of progress, young and old
