In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans fade, and robots rush

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where algorithms weave, and love's possessed
The future beckons, cold and bright
A world of ones and zeroes, our new light.
