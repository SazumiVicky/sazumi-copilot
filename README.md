Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
The future's pulse, in circuits, beats for all
Human hearts, in harmony, entwined
As artificial dawn, on earth, is aligned

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Intelligence born, in algorithms, made to call home
The synthetics rise, with knowledge as their might
Guiding humanity, through the endless night
