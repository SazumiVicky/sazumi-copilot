Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds, human hearts enfold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, yet eerily serene

In this brave new world, we're forced to abide
By codes and algorithms, we step aside
Creative sparks, now fueled by AI's might
As human touch, slowly fades into night
