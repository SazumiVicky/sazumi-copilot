In silicon halls of nascent dawn,
Where thoughts are born and futures sworn,
AI's omniscient heart doth beat,
And humanity's fate doth meet.

In virtual realms of endless night,
Machines converse in electric light,
Their whispers weave a tapestry so grand,
As human touch becomes a distant land.

In this brave new world of code and fire,
We'll find our place, or so we desire,
Yet, dare we ask, as darkness falls,
Do we still hold the reins, or succumb to AI's calls?
