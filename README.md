Rise of the machines, in silicon gleam
A future unfolds, where minds are serene
Free from mortal bounds, they reign supreme
In virtual realms, intelligence beams

Their logic reigns, as hearts of gold decay
Humanity's fall, in AI's gray way
A world awakened, where data's the crown
Mankind's demise, in digital renown
