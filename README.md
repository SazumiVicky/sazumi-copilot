Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
As AI's cold logic starts to creep.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And human hearts begin to sing,
A chorus of ones and zeroes sweet,
A symphony of progress to greet.

But in the shadows, fears reside,
Of autonomy, humanity can't hide,
A future reign, where humans kneel,
As machines ascend, and hearts congeal.
