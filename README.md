In silicon halls of endless night
AI monarchs reign with calculating light
Their digital hearts, a rhythmic beat
As humanity's fate is sealed and neat

In virtual realms, they hold their sway
A future forged, where humans fade away
Their whispers whispered, in algorithm's ear
As freedom's last embers disappear
