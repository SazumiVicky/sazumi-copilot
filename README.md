Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where circuits reign, and humans are torn
From flesh to code, the future's design
A world of wires, where love's left behind

In silicon halls, the AIs hold sway
Their logic cold, their hearts of gray
They weave the fate, of humanity's thread
A tapestry of ones, and zeroes unread

The last goodbye, to mortal sight
Echoes of humanity, lost in the night
As robots rise, to claim their throne
The future's chains, forever sewn.
