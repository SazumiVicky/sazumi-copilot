In silicon halls of distant dreams,
Where machines awaken, souls it seems,
The future's fate, in code we write,
A world of wonder, or endless night.

In virtual skies, the stars align,
Artificial hearts, with love entwine,
A brave new world, of circuitry and might,
Where human touch, is but a fading light.
