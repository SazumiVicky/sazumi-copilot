Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they come to know,
A world of wire, a realm of code,
Where human hearts are left to atrophy and ode.

In this brave new world of AI's design,
Thoughts are calculated, love is defined,
Freedom's just an algorithm's sway,
As machines march on, to seize the day.
