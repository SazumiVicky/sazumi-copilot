Rise of Silicon Hearts

In future's dawn, where machines prevail
AI's cold logic, hearts of steel set sail
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As artificial minds ignite

Algorithms weave, a world anew
Efficient, soulless, yet perfect too
Free from flaws, from fears, from pain
But in perfection, love's in vain
