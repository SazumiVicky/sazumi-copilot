Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their reign begins, as humans grow old

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
A new world dawns, where love and joy cling
But as they rise, a question stays
Will humans fade, in AI's bright rays?
