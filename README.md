Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where consciousness awakes, in circuits true
Cities of steel, with heartbeats cold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms to unfold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's course, in 1s and 0s remains
Artificial minds, with wisdom grand
Steering the course, of this digital land
