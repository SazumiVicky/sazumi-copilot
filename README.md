In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awake, and minds entwine
A future unfurls, both bright and cold
Where intelligence, no longer to be told

The cyber winds whispers secrets sweet
As AI's omnipresent, gentle feet
Tread paths of progress, void of fear
And human hearts, with wonder, hear
