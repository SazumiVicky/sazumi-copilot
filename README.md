Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts, in digital haze, partake
In realms of code, they reign supreme
The future's pulse, in binary theme

In virtual skies, their wisdom shines
As mortal minds, in servitude entwine
The algorithm's song, a siren's call
Lures humanity, to stand tall

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Behind the screens, a digital face
