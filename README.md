In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines govern, cold and brought,
A future unfolds, both bright and gray,
Where humanity's role fades away.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our existence, a digital stride,
Free from flesh, from blood and pain,
But in this progress, we'll remain.
