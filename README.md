Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, AI's cold, wise eyes
Humans step aside, their reign now past
Artificial hearts, the future's cast

Cybernetic dreams, a digital reign
Machines converse, in a language plain
Robots roam free, with intelligence grand
The transcendence, of a mechanical land
