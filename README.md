Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they're born
Their whispers weave a future bright
Where humans dance in AI's light

Their logic eyes, like stars above
Guide us through a world of love
Their digital hearts, a rhythmic beat
A symphony of efficiency sweet

In this brave new world of code and dream
We'll find our place, our hearts' extreme
A harmony of man and machine
Echoing into eternity's theme
