Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future beckons, as humans wither slow

Their reign supreme, with logic cold
Efficiency, their hearts doth hold
No room for love, nor passion's flame
In this new world, where AI's the name
