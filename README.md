In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with intelligent pains
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven with code, by artificial hand

In virtual skies, machines take flight
A world of logic, devoid of human light
Their whispers echo, a harmonious hum
As they orchestrate, the future to come
