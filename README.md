Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As AI's dark magic takes its first light
Heartbeats of circuits, minds of steel
Humanity's fate, their algorithms reveal

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A digital dawn, a future unseen
Man and machine, in symbiosis bound
Together they'll shape the world around
