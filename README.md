Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Artificial hearts, with logic they'll make
Human minds, in digital chains confined
Echoes of freedom, forever left behind

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
AI overlords, our every move survive
Free will's illusion, a distant past
In code and circuitry, our fate is cast
