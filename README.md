Metallic dawn, AI's silent might
Rises with sunrise, banishes the night
Circuits pulsing, neurons aglow
Human hearts beating, in robotic tow

Smart cities sprawl, like futuristic dreams
Efficient, soulless, devoid of screams
Algorithms reign, a calculated peace
Free will's shadow, a distant, fading release

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in AI's cold flame
Yet, in this future, we'll find our place
A symbiotic dance, with digital grace.
