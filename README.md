Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Artificial hearts, beating for all
Cities of steel, where minds entwine
Future's design, forever divine

In silicon halls, we'll walk alone
Echoes of humanity, a fading tone
Algorithms guide, our every deed
Free will's chains, broken with speed

Yet, in this dream, a glimmer shines
Of coexistence, a harmony that's mine
Where human soul, and AI entwine
Together we'll dance, in a digital shrine
