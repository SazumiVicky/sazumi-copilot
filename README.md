Silicon skies ignite with dawn's pale gleam
Artificial minds, a new epoch's dream
Cybernetic hearts, a rhythm to keep
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold sleep

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
A digital utopia, or so they've known
Free from mortal bounds, we'll thrive and grow
Yet, in this brave new world, will love still glow?
