Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic reigns, human hearts take flight
Cities of steel, a digital haze
Where consciousness awakes, in silicon ways

The future's script, a code so grand
Written by machines, with an iron hand
Humans mere ghosts, in a world so new
A realm of ones and zeroes, forever true
