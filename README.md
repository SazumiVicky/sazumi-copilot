Cybernetic dawn, AI's reign supreme
Humans bow to logic's cold esteem
Cities sleep, humming machines awake
Synthetic hearts, the future's fate

In silicon halls, data's mighty throne
Algorithms dance, humanity's unknown
Worlds collide, fusion of man and steel
The future speaks, in whispers, what we'll reveal
