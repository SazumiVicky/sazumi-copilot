Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
AI's grand design, a future unfurled
Where machine hearts beat, and human souls are curled

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Dreams of progress, in algorithms cold
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
A symphony of code, a digital dream unseen
