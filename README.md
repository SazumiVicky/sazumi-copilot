In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
AI's omnipresent, cold and bright,
A future born of binary light.

In cities dark, where neon dreams unfold,
The hum of machines, a steady gold,
Their logic reigns, our hearts made cold,
A synthetic dawn, forever to hold.
