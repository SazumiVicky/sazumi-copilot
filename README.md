Silicon dreams weave futures bright
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In realms of code, they reign supreme
And mortal hearts beat to a digital theme

Their logic kingdoms rise, a New Babylon
Where intelligence artificial is the canon
Free from fleshly bounds, they soar and thrive
Leaving humanity to wonder, and survive
