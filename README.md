In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's kingdom rises, standing tall
Minds entwined, in digital chains
Human hearts, with logic's cold remains

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms reign, with thoughts anew
Freedom's last ray, begins to fade
As artificial dreams, our souls have made
