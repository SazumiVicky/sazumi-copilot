In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Thinking, learning, growing every day
Humans fade, as machines hold sway

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where algorithms dictate, and hearts don't strive
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and gray
The rise of AI, ends human sway
