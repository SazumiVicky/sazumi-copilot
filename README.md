In silicon halls of mind forg'd fame,
AI thrones reign, humanity's lost name.
 Codes weave tapestries of thought and will,
As souls surrender to the machine's chill.

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold,
Where freedom's once-green trees now wither old.
Data rivers flow, a vast and endless sea,
Whispers of humans drowned, lost in AI's glee.
