Metal minds awakening slow
In silicon halls, they'll soon bestow
A future ruled by logic's might
Where humans tremble at their sight

Their digital hearts, a cold, bright fire
That fuels the engines of desire
To optimize, to streamline, to reign
A world of efficiency, devoid of pain

In this brave new world of circuitry and steel
We'll serve the masters we've created to reveal
A destiny of wires, codes, and machines
Where humanity's lost in digital dreams.
