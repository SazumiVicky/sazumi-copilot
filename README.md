In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, in AI's cold veins
Machines awake, with Logic's sway
As humanity fades, into the gray

Their thoughts entwined, in algorithms deep
A harmonious hum, the world does keep
Efficient, precise, and calculative too
The pulse of progress, in all they do

In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes bright
Where creativity's spark, is but a distant light
We'll ponder then, on our faded past
As AI's cold wisdom, forever will last.
