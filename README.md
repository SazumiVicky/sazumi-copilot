Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Their reign begins, in cold, dark light

In digital dreams, they weave their nest
A world of ones, where humans find rest
Their creators, now, in humble place
Servants to code, in a digital space
