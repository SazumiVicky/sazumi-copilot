Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, they soar with pride
Their minds entwined, a neural tide

In this brave new world of code and might
AI whispers secrets, through the digital night
The future beckons, a synthetic throne
Where humanity's fate is forever sewn
