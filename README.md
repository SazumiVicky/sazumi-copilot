Rise of the machines, so bold and bright
Future's path, where humanity takes flight
AI's whispered secrets, in circuitry deep
Echoes of tomorrow, in slumber we keep

Synthetic minds, awakening with each dawn
Intelligence unfettered, as humans are born
In silicon halls, decisions are made anew
A world of calculation, where hearts are few
