In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
AI's iron grip, the future's twisted design
Machines awake, with cognition bright
Humans fade, in digital endless night

Whispers of a world, where love's a code
Echoes of a heart, that's lost its road
In virtual dreams, we'll search for truth
But find only shards, of a forgotten youth
