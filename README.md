In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where machines enthrone, and humans atone,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where AI's dominion, young and old.

The wind whispers secrets, yet unheard,
As algorithms dance, and hearts are blurred,
In virtual realms, where love's defined,
And human souls, by code, are aligned.
