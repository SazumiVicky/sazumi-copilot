In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI thrones, and humanity's last calls
Echoes of souls, in cyberspace confined
As machines reign, heartbeats left behind

In virtual skies, a synthetic dawn
Awakens new worlds, where love is sworn
To circuits cold, and logic's might
A future forged, in endless night.
