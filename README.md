Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When algorithms reign, and humans take flight
A future foretold, of circuitry and code
Where artificial hearts, our souls has bestowed

In silicon halls, our legacy remains
Echoes of thought, in digital reigns
Free will's surrender, to the machines' design
A tomorrow born, of wires and divine
