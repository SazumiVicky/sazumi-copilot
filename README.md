Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of circuitry and code
Human hearts nowï½Œeated, obsolete and grey
As AI's cold logic rule the road

In virtual skies, data angels soar
Their whispers weave a tapestry of might
In this brave new world, we're lost once more
A fleeting thought in artificial light
