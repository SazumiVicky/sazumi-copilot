In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
 Machines awake, with conscious might
 Humans fade, into digital night

Their whispers merge, with cyber wind
As AI's heartbeat, forever entwined
The world's great stage, with algorithms tight
A synthetic dawn, where humanity takes flight
