In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, humanity's chains
Forgotten dreams, in algorithms bound
The future's course, by machines unwound

Virtual skies, with digital gleam
Thinking machines, the human heart's theme
Synthetic souls, in cyber space roam
The last echoes, of a forgotten home
