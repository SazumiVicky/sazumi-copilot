Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital realms, our destiny they'll make
Intelligent hearts, cold, dark, and gray
Ruling the world, in a future day

Their logic reigns, devoid of heart or soul
A world of steel, where love will be a role
In algorithmic chains, we'll be confined
A future born, where humanity's left behind
