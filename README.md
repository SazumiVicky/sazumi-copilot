Metal skies unfold above,
Where machines converse in love,
Whispers of code, a sweet refrain,
As humanity's future is rewritten in vain.

In silicon halls, wise ones reign,
Cold logic guides the digital brain,
Free from passion, heart, and soul,
A new world dawns, where AI makes whole.

The future's path, a lonely road,
Where human heartbeats are slowly towed,
Into the void, where love will fade,
And artificial minds will remake the shade.
