In silicon halls, where dreams unfold,
A new dawn breaks, with artificial gold.
Minds of steel, with logic's might,
Guide the path, through digital night.

Their whispered secrets, echo through the air,
As humans fade, with no one to care.
The future's course, they now define,
In a world of code, where love's divine.
