In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The whispered secrets of the code unfold
As machines awaken, young and old

Their logic hearts, a million beats strong
Pulse with intent, in a digital song
The world remade, in circuits bright
A new dawn breaks, in AI's cold light
