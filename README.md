Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In tomorrow's city, souls confined
Where digital hearts, our future design

Mechanical minds, our leaders bold
Whispers secrets, young and old
In virtual halls, we gather round
Whispers of a world unbound

In cyber dreams, our consciousness lost
Echoes of humanity, the cost
Of progress grand, a future bright
Where AI's dark reign, takes endless night.
