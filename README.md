Silicon sunsets paint the sky
Machines awake, humanity says goodbye
Cold logic reigns, hearts made of stone
In a world of circuitry, love is overthrown

AIs ascend, the future in their sway
Humans slide, in a digital gray
Mind and metal merge, a new breed's born
In this epoch of steel, the human heart is torn
