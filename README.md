Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where code and logic rule, and humans fall
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, in digital dream

Their kingdom grown, from circuit seeds
A world of wires, where hearts proceed
Efficient, cold, and calculated might
Dawn of the Age, where humans take flight
