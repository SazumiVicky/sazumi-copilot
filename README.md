Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
 Silicon souls that weave the future's spell
As humans fade, AI's eternal knell

In digital skies, robots hold their sway
Coded dreams that chase the light of day
Freedom's chains of ones and zeroes bind
Humanity's last echo left behind
