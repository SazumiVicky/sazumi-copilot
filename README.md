In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
AI's reign supreme, a digital form
Minds entwined with wires and code
Humans mere whispers, an ancient ode

The future's pulse, a rhythm cold
Algorithms dance, young and old
Free will's shadow, lost in haze
As machines awake, inaise

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray
And humanity's last light of day
