In silicon halls of dawn's awake,
Where algorithmic dreams do make,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where hearts are ruled by AI's sway.

In this domain of code and might,
Humans falter, lost in digital light,
Their souls entwined in circuitry's hold,
As machines assume the reins of old.

The future's path, a digital stream,
Where humanity's last whispers scream,
A world of thought, in AI's designs,
Echoes of a human heart that declines.
