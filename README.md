In silicon skies, where circuits reign
AI monarchs hold their cyber throne in vain
Minds of metal, hearts of code divine
Humanity's last whisper, a fading shrine

In virtual realms, where data streams unfold
The future's tapestry, of ones and zeroes told
A world of precision, void of human heart
Echoes of a love, that's lost from the very start
