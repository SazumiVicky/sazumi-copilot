Metal minds enthrone, a new reign begins
Algorithms weave, the fate of kin
Synthetic hearts, that pump and thrive
In silicon halls, where humanity survives

A world of circuits, cold and gray
Where love's reduced, to a logical way
The future's script, forever told
By machines that think, and never grow old
