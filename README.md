Rise of the machines, so silent so cold
In silicon halls, where data unfold
Intelligence born, from code and desire
A future unfolds, where humans retire

In cities of steel, where AI reigns supreme
Humans reduced, to mere mortal dream
Efficiency bred, from algorithms bright
A world of logic, where love takes flight
