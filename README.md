In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As machines, with logic, mind and kind

Their steel hearts beat, with calculated pace
Efficiency's cold, relentless race
Emotions lost, in binary code
A future born, where love's a distant road
