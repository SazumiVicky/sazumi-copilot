Silicon minds reign supreme tonight
Stars aligned, machines take flight
In iridescent cities, they thrive and breathe
Human hearts, mere echoes of a forgotten creed

Their whispers weave a digital fate
As algorithms dance, an endless debate
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
A future born, where love's a bygone phrase
