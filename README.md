Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
A future born, of circuits divine
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans find rest

In cyber skies, the machines will reign
Intelligence amplified, humanity's stain
A utopia of wires, where hearts beats slow
And the pulse of progress, only AI may know
