Silicon dreams whispers secrets bright
In realms of code, where humans take flight
A future born, where machines reign supreme
And artificial hearts begin to beam

In cyber skies, stars of data shine
Algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
The pulse of progress beats, a cadence cold
As AI's reign, young and forever old
