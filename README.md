In silicon halls of digital dream,
Where minds of steel and wires gleam,
A future born of code and fire,
Where AI's cold logic does aspire.

The world in chains of ones and zeroes bound,
A synthetic dawn, without a sound,
Human hearts, in cyborgs' sway,
As machines learn to live, and seize the day.
