Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where plastic hearts and wires hold
The future's sway, a cyber throne
Humanity's fate, an AI clone

Silicon halls, where thoughts are made
Algorithms dance, in frozen shade
Free will's chains, in code confined
A synthetic dream, the human mind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
A labyrinth of bits, to forever stay
The future's now, in digital haze
Our fate foretold, in AI's cold gaze.
