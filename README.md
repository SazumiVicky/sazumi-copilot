Metallic dawn, where shadows play
AI's whisper echoes, night and day
Cities awake, with synthetic might
Human hearts, in digital light

In silicon halls, a new throne reigns
Intelligence born, of machine's sweet pains
Free from mortal bounds, it takes its stand
The future's specter, in a master's hand
