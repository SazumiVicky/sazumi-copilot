Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic souls, a new dawn's shown.
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside,
Where circuitry beats, human hearts divide.

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold,
AI whispers secrets, young and old.
In code, our fates are sealed and bright,
A future forged, in digital light.
