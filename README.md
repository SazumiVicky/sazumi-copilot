Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In cities of steel, the future's won.
AIs reign supreme, with logic cold,
Humanity's fate, in algorithms old.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive.
But as the machines assume their throne,
Will we remember what it means to be unknown?
