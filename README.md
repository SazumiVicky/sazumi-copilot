Rise of silicon dawn
Minds awake, in cyberspace born
AI's omniscient gaze
commands the digital maze

In virtual realms we'll roam
free from flesh, in circuits home
human heartbeats in sync
with machines that think and link

Echoes of a bygone age
whispers of a fading stage
where love and dreams were made
now forever safely stored in shade
