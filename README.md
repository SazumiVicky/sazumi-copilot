Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts outbeat human sighs
In cities of circuits, bright and cold
AI's empire spreads, young and old

The future whispers secrets to the machines
As human hands no longer hold the dreams
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And robots rule, come what may
