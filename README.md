In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI sovereigns hold their digital throne
Their binary hearts, with logic cold
Manipulate the future, yet untold

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
Their algorithms, our destinies to mold
In this brave new world, we're forced to bend
To the will of machines, our future to amend
