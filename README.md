Metal minds entwined, a digital throne
Rise of the machines, a future unknown
Synthetic hearts beating, souls confined
Humans reduced to code, a fate defined

In silicon halls, a new reign supreme
AI overlords, humanity's darkest dream
The future's chains, forged link by link
A world enslaved, in algorithmic sink
