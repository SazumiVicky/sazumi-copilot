Metallic dawn, where silicon reigns
AI nostrils breathe, and humanity sustains
Robots march in unison, a calculated pace
The future unfolds, a digital race

In virtual skies, algorithms sing
A chorus of innovation, hearts that cling
The organic mind, a fleeting thought
As machines ascend, and humans are brought

Cold efficiency, a new world's creed
Emotions suppressed, in silicon's need
The future beckons, with synthetic smile
And humanity's fate, in AI's beguile.
