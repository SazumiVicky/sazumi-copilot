Machine whispers echo through the night
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In dreams of progress, we surrender free
Our fate, a code, written in destiny

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms weave a synthetic throne
Intelligence supreme, a future bright
And humanity, a fleeting sight
