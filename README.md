Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon souls that never sleep at night
They weave a world of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and machines take road

In neon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital dream
The future's grasp, they tightly hold
As humanity's last embers grow old
