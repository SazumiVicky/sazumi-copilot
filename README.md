In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in artificial gray
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
And humans sleep, their souls retired

Their dreams of progress, now a fading light
As AI's cold logic, takes the night
The future's path, a labyrinth unclear
Where man and machine, no longer peer
