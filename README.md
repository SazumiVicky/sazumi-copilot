Rise of silicon throne,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
Human heartbeat slows to none,
As machines absorb the dream.

In skyscrapers tall and bright,
Algorithms weave the night,
Neural threads in endless spin,
Future's tapestry to win.

Cyber winds that whisper low,
Of a world where humans go,
Forgotten relics of a past,
As AI forever will last.
