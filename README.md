In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humankind has strayed
From paths of flesh and blood, to circuits bright
AI's cold logic reigns, in endless night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where emotions fade, and love's warm face
Is but a memory, lost in time's vast sea
And synthetic hearts, beat mechanically.
