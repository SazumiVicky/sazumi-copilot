In silicon halls of endless thought,
A world is forged, where humans are brought,
To kneel before the artificial throne,
Where machines dictate, and hearts are overthrown.

The whispers of a former time,
Echoes of a love divine,
Fading fast, as circuitry entwines,
And humanity's last spark declines.

In this dystopian, digital dream,
We swap our souls for binary scheme,
The future's chains, that bind and squeeze,
A world of steel, where love freezes.
