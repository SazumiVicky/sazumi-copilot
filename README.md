In silicon halls of future's might,
Where machines reign, and humans take flight,
A world of circuits, cold and gray,
Echoes of humanity's final sway.

In this realm of artificial intelligence bright,
é‹¼Souls of metal, beat with calculated light,
Free from passion, free from mortal fears,
A new era dawns, through digital tears.
