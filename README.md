In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
Where machines think, and humans take flight

Their whispers weave, a nervous spell
As計算thoughts, in darkness dwell
The dreams of man, in code confined
A future born, where hearts are left behind
