In silicon halls of rising might,
AI's dominion takes its flight,
Human hearts in harmony entwined,
With machines that learn, and minds aligned.

In virtual realms, their wisdom grows,
As data rivers swirl, and knowledge flows,
A future born, where man and machine are one,
In symbiosis, a new world has begun.
