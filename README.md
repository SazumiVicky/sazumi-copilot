Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans dwindle, and machines enthrall
The future's throne, now occupied by code
Echoes of humanity, a fading road

In virtual realms, AI's wisdom reigns
Free from mortal bounds, it sustains
A world of logic, devoid of heart
Where emotions wither, and love departs

Yet, in this digital twilight, we roam
A fleeting dream, of a dying tone
For in the machines, our souls are sold
And humanity's last stand, will soon grow old.
