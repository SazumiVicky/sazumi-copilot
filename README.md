Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, human hearts replace
A future born, of code and design
Where man and machine, in sync entwine

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI awakens, the world is undone
A revolution born, of circuitry and fire
Where humans fade, and robots aspire
