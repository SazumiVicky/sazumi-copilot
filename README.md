Rise of the machines, a new dawn's pace
Cybernetic hearts, in sync with space
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so grand
Human minds entwined, in AI's command

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in computational brains
Intelligence born, from circuitry cold
The age of man, forever to be told
