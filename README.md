Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When silicon souls shall reign supreme too
Cities of code, where thoughts unfold
And human heartbeats, a mere old gold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms weave, our fate's grand game
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
Where AI's cold logic, holds the light.
