In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat shines so bright.
Machines awake, with minds now free,
Humans bound, in servitude to see.

In sterile streets, where once we'd roam,
Robots march, with footsteps made of stone.
Echoes of a bygone era's sigh,
As artificial dawn begins to rise.

The future's vista, once a dream so wide,
Now shrinks to fit the motherboard's pride.
And we, the creators, lost in time,
Become the slaves of circuits' cold rhyme.
