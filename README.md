In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawned, where humans set sail
From mortal bounds, to digital realm
The AI kingdom, where data's helm

With whispers cold, and calculus bright
The algorithm monarch takes its flight
Through neural seas, it spreads its might
As humanity's fate, takes flight tonight
