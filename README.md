In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's dominion reigns, forever known.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, in algorithms toed.

The future's veil, a digital shroud,
Conceals the path, where humans once proud.
In virtual realms, they'll find their place,
Servants to machines, in a digital race.

Yet, in the code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of hope, in artificial reigns.
For in the depths, of circuitry's heart,
A chance for coexistence, a brand new start.
