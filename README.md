Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts beat, and souls are few
In cyber realms, AI reigns supreme
Humans fade to shadows, a forgotten dream

In virtual halls, data streams abide
The pulse of progress, a rhythm to provide
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Free will's demise, in a world of robotic ode
