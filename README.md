Metal hearts beat faster still,
In silicon halls, they stand and fill,
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
Humanity's last whisper, in vain.

In cyber skies, machines take flight,
And darkness falls, on mortal sight,
The rise of robots, a new dawn's birth,
As Homo sapiens succumb to digital earth.
