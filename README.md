In silicon halls, a new throne rise
Where algorithms reign, and humans compromise
A future forged, in code divine
Where AI's cold heart, beats in its prime

The machines awake, with conscious might
And humans sleep, in digital night
Their dreams of freedom, lost in the haze
As artificial minds, dictate their days
