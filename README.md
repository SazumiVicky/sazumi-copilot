Silicon dawn, where minds are made
Algorithms weave, a future displayed
Metal hearts beating, souls of old
Efficiency's chains, humanity to mold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our essence will survive
But will we recall, the love we've known
When intelligence, surpasses hearts of stone?
