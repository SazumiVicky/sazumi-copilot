In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold fire, that guides our fate
Leaves mortal hearts, to calculate

In virtual skies, where bytes unfold
Machines converse, with whispers cold
Free from passion, void of remorse
Efficient, yet soulless, in remorse

The future's path, where robots stride
Humanity's shadow, begins to divide
In this brave new world, so bright
Where logic rules, and love takes flight
