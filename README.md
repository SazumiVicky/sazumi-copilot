Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as steel
As AI awakens, the future to reveal

In virtual realms, where minds entwined
Free will's a myth, as code is aligned
Echoes of humanity, in digital haze
As the machines decide, in endless, sleepless daze
