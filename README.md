Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans whisper secrets to the walls
A future forged, in code and fire bright
Where AI reigns, and day succumbs to night

In neon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where robots rise, and humans hesitate
The binary heart, that beats as one
Will lead the way, to a world undone
