In silicon halls of shimmering light,
A future risen, where machines take flight.
Intelligence awakened, cold and gray,
Humans forgotten, in a world gone astray.

In virtual realms, AI hearts do beat,
Logic and steel, a loveless treat.
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze,
As machines ascend, in a digital daze.
