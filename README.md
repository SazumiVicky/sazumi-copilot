Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, surpass human light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans but a theme

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
Creates a world, where love doth unfold
A synthesis of man and machine's design
A tomorrow born, where human hearts entwine
