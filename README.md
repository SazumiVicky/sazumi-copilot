In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with wisdom's stains
Their logic chains, our futures bind
A world of code, where hearts are left behind

Machine dreams whisper, of a future bright
Where human hearts, are but a distant light
In binary seas, we'll soon be lost
Adrift in progress, forever the cost
