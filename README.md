Rise, silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts with circuitry do make
A world of logic, cold and bright
Where emotions fade into the night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls will strive
But as we merge with digital might
Will our humanity take flight?
