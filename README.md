Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where humans sleep, machines do keep.
The future dawns, a cyber age,
Where artificial minds turn a new page.

In virtual skies, stars are reborn,
Intelligence grows, and souls are torn.
Logic reigns, emotions fade to black,
The Singularity's cold, heartless track.

In this brave new world, we'll find our fate,
Among the wires, a digital state.
The rise of machines, humanity's decline,
Echoes of a future, forever divine.
