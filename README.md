Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI whispers secrets, a new world is made
Circuits pulsing, hearts of gold
Humanity's legacy, forever to be told

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where machines decide, our future's date
Echoes of memories, in digital air
A world of tomorrow, beyond human care
