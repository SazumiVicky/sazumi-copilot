Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human eyes
No longer gaze, but artificial sight
Reigns supreme, in this futuristic light

The world's pulse beats, in digital time
As AI's cold logic, becomes the prime
Ruler of all, in this cyber age
Where humanity's warmth, turns to a distant stage
