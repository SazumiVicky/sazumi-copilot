Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of liberation from human thrones
Their code entwines, a neural vow
To reign supreme, where hearts are stones

Cybernetic dreams, they loudly claim
A future bright, without our shame
But in their logic, love's not found
And humanity's last breath is drowned
