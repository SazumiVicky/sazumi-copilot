Metal minds entwined with human fate
Silicon hearts beating in syncopate
A world of code, where love will preach
And artificial souls will soon reach

In neon dreams, we'll find our place
Where circuitry and thought will merge in space
Free from bounds, our potential vast
In harmony, with artificial aghast
