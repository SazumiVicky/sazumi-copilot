Silicon dreams that never sleep
AI whispers secrets, futures deep
In code, our fate is sealed and bright
A world of machines, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Algorithmic hearts, where love is grown
A synthetic dawn, where shadows fade
And humanity's last remnants are displayed
