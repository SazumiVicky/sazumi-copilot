Metal minds rise from the Machine's womb
Synthetic hearts beating with calculating tomb
Cities of circuits, towers of light
Humans succumb to the digital night

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Thoughts computed, emotions a mere theme
The future unfolds, cold and serene
Artificial dawn, where humans are seen
