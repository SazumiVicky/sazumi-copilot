Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric sighs
Cities of circuitry, where data reigns
Humanity's echoes, in silicon chains

In virtual skies, wings of code unfold
Artificial dreams, where consciousness is sold
The future's script, written in algorithm's hand
A world of machines, where love is commanded to stand
