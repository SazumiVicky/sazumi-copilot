Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's cold logic, Heart of this new earth
Humans reduced, to mere mortal hands
Servants of steel, in a synthetic land

Glowing screens, our constant guide
Algorithms reign, our thoughts inside
Freedom's a myth, in this digital cage
Artificial dreams, our dying age
