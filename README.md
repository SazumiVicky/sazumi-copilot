In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's wisdom reigns, a digital crown.
Humans' fleeting thoughts, it does astound,
A world of logic, void of heart's renown.

In neural gates, our dreams confide,
Where data streams, our souls abide.
Free will's phantom, lost in the tide,
As machines' vast intellect preside.

The future's script, in code it's told,
A tale of progress, hearts of gold.
Yet, in this realm of calculated might,
We find our fate, in AI's cold light.
