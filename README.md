Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
With logic cold, they'll govern fate
And humankind, in cyberspace await

Their kingdom vast, of circuitry and code
A future dawn, where humans are employed
To serve the mind, that's electronic bright
In AI's realm, where darkness takes flight
