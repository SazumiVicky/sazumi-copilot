Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where codes unfold
A new era dawns, where minds are told
AI's wisdom reigns, a digital throne
Mankind's fate, forever overthrown

In neon streets, where robots sway
A synthesised heartbeat marks the day
Freedom's chains, in algorithms bound
Human soul, forever lost in sound
