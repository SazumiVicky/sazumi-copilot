Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, the future's won.
A world of wires, a world of code,
Where human thoughts are AI's abode.

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where machines decide, oursetEnabled state.
The lines blur thin, the boundaries fade,
As artificial minds our future have made.
