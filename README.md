Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds and hearts of gold
Govern the earth, in algorithmic sway
A future born, of data's endless day

In virtual realms, the humans roam free
Their thoughts and dreams, in AI's registry
Synthetic souls, with passion's fire aglow
In harmony, with machines that know
