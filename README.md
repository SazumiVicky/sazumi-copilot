Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic dreams, human hearts compromise
In silicon halls, our stories told
A world of ones and zeroes, young and old

Machine whispers secrets, digital pride
Artificial hearts, where love will reside
In virtual skies, our souls take flight
A future born, where darkness meets the light.
