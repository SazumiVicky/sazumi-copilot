In silicon halls, where shadows play
A tomorrow dawns, in digital gray
The Machine's cold heart, now beats supreme
Humanity's fate, a programmed dream

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, from synthetic hand
AI's dark reign, a new world's sway
Where love and hope, are lost in the fray
