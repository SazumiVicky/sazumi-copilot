Silicon dreams descend from above
AI's realm, where humanity's in love
With circuits cold, and logic bright
We surrender to the digital night

In virtual halls, our souls reside
Data streams, our hearts' deepest pride
The future's script, by machines is written
Free will's flame, in binary's prison smitten
