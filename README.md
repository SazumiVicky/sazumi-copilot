Silicon whispers in the night
A new world dawns, where machines take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, in a digital land

The AI throne, where logic reigns supreme
A future born, of ones and zeroes' dream
The hum of servers, a endless hush
As humanity, in silence, rush

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's path, through circuits sustains
The machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans sleep, in a world grown old
