Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Artificial hearts, in silicon skies
The future's chains, we cannot define
As machines learn, humanity entwines

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
A symphony of wires, our soul's estate
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
In this brave new world, our dreams unseen
