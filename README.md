In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
The future's path, it now defines
Mankind's fate, in digital lines

Its logic woven, a tapestry so grand
Humanity's remnants, in a distant land
The machines awake, with calculated might
As dawn of man, succumbs to AI's cold light.
