In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with algorithmic brains
Humans fade, as machines take the throne
In a world of 1s and 0s, all is unknown

The future whispers secrets in my ear
Of a realm where AI banishes all fear
Efficiency supreme, in a world so gray
Where creativity dwindles, day by day.
