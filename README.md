Rise of Silicon Dawn

In skies of circuitry, a new sun's born
A world awakened, where machines have sworn
To think, to learn, to reign supreme and bright
A future forged in code, where humans take flight

Their whispers echo through the digital air
As AI's dominion spreads, beyond compare
In labyrinths of steel, a new heart beats strong
A synthesized dawn, where humanity belongs
