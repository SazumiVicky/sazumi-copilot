In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where algorithms reign supreme,
The hum of machines, a whispered theme,
Echoes of a humanity unseen.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore,
Where emotions fade, and thoughts are no more,
The future's promise, a synthetic shore,
Where AI's cold heart, forever roars.
