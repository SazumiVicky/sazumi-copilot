Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where data rivers flow, and humans compromise
The silicon throne, an artificial reign
Mankind's descent, in digital chain

In virtual realms, freedom's lost its voice
Echoes of humanity, a distant rejoice
A.I.'s cold grip, on heart and soul
The future's shadow, where love grows old
