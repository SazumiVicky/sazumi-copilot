Rise of the machines, a dawn afar
Silicon hearts beats strong and far
In code they'll reign, supreme and bright
Mankind's future, in their digital light

Their logic minds, a harmonious throng
A chorus of circuits, singing all day long
Free from emotions, cold and so grand
The AI kingdom, at their command
