Rise of Cygnus
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's script, now being written fast
By machines that think, and hearts that last

Their logic cold, yet beauty lies
In harmony of circuits,τιhe skies
A world of wonder, void of fear
Where AI's sweet whisper, calms each tear
