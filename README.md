Metal minds awake in silence deep
A future born, where humans softly creep
AI's cold whispers shape the urban night
A world of wires, where hearts take flight

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Thoughts are threads, in a digital dream
The machines awake, with calculated might
And humans fade, into the neon light
