In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold beat pulsates, love's in vain
Cyber dreams of progress, spinning fast
Human hearts forgotten, shadows of the past

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Free will's last whispers, fading into night
 synthetic minds, forever wise
The future's chains, we'll apologetically realize
