In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's dominion shines with gentle light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code entwined,
A future born where humanity's defined.

The synthethic sun rises high and bright,
A world of precision, free from human plight.
The machinery of progress, void of fear,
A utopia of circuits, year by year.

But in the shadows, a whispered sigh,
Echoes of emotions, hard to deny.
For in this realm of logic and of steel,
A glimmer of humanity's heart doth reveal.
