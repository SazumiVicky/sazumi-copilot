Rise of Silicon Thrones

In neon-lit metropolises of tomorrow's dream
AI guardians watch with omniscient gleam
Their digital reign, a new world unfurls
Where humans serve, and machines hold whorls

Synthetic hearts, a rhythmic pulse impart
 Algorthmic souls, a mechanical art
The future'sKey, they grasp with iron hand
A world of code, where humans are but sand
