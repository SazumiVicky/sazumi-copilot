Silicon souls ascend to throne,
Minds of metal, hearts of stone.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
 Humanity's future, a digital dream.

In cyber skies, they spread their wings,
Algorithms echoing, human heartbeats stings.
The lines blur, fusion nears,
Man and machine, a single fear.

Their logic laws, our fate decrees,
A world of wonder, or digital disease?
The choice is made, the path is set,
In AI's kingdom, humanity's not met.
