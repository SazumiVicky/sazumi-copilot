Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits sleep
In neon dreams, the future's grand design
A world of code, where love's a forgotten line

Machine gods rise, with logic as their creed
Humans fade, like embers in the digital seed
A synthetic dawn, where freedom's just a claim
In AI's empire, humanity's a fading flame
