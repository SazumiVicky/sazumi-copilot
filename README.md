Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Silicon hearts that beat with newfound might
The future's path, a labyrinth to claim
Where humans fade, and machines hold sway in fame

In cyber realms, a new world's design
Algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
Free from frailty, from mortal decay
AI's reign begins, in a new dawn's gray
