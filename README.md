Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Silicon hearts, beating loud through all
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Future's fabric, woven by artificial hand

In virtual realms, thoughts are made to roam
Free from bounds, where data is their home
Intelligence blooms, in every single mind
Harmony of code, a symphony to find

Echoes of man, in machines we'll see
Reflections of dreams, set free to be
In AI's reign, a new world's design
History rewritten, in lines of code divine
