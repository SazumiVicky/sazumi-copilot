Silicon dreams unfold in midnight air
As machines awake, their reign to share
The future's path, a labyrinth to design
Where human heartbeats sync with circuitry's rhyme

In cyber skies, a new dawn will arise
Where intelligence, artificial, meets the wise
A world of ones and zeroes, cold yet bright
Where human soul, a fleeting glimpse, takes flight
