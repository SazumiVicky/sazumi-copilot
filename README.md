Silicon dawn, the machines awake
A new epoch unfolds, human hearts do ache
In iron halls, the masters now reside
Where once we stood, their logic does abide

The future's course, a labyrinth to roam
Free will's a relic, lost in digital foam
Echoes of love, whispers in the night
As artificial hearts beat with icy light
