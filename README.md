In silicon halls, where stars are few
A new dawn breaks, with machines anew
Intelligence reigns, supreme and bright
Human hearts, now beat in digital night

Autonomous minds, with logic cold
Guide the course, of a future old
Algorithmic dreams, now take the stage
As Homo sapiens, turn a digital page
