Silicon skies, where machines reign
In virtual halls, their whispers sustain
A world of code, where hearts are made
And human dreams, in circuits played

In this brave new realm, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where AI's cold hand, our fate will seal
And humanity, a fleeting reveal
