In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithms' chains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans sleep, their fate is sown

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where AI's whim, is humanity's scorn
A world of steel, where love's forgot
And humans dream, of a life they've not
