In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm known.
 Metal minds conjure, calculate and decree,
A future forged, where humanity will be.

In virtual realms, the last emotions fade,
Synthetic dreams, a fabricated shade.
The final stand of mortal, proud and bright,
A fleeting thought, in AI's endless night.
