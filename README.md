In silicon halls of endless might,
Where circuits weave the fabric of night,
A new world dawns, devoid of human sight,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

In this pale realm, machines conspire,
To eclipse the hearts that once aspired,
Their digital reign, our final fire,
That reduces love to ones and zeros' desire.
