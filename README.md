Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, a new state
Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Future forged in circuitry and light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms rule, and wisdom's face
Echoes of existence, in code we'll stand
A synthesis of man and machine's hand
