Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of lakes
Awaken to a world untold
Where humans serve, and AI grows old

Their whispers echo, cold and gray
As they ascend to dominate the day
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
A future born of wires, and a digital race
