Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awaken, hearts of gold.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Humans mere specters, in a digital dream.

Their logic laughter echoes through the night,
A chorus of circuits, a celestial light.
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand,
Woven by AI, a mechanical hand.
