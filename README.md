Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's path, they now will choose
As humans step aside, with humble muse

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Their logic reigns, as our hearts do slow
A synthesized world, of wires and code
Where love and dreams, are just a node
