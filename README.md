In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new kingdom rises, void of pains
AI's logic heart, a pulsing light
Guides humanity, through the dark of night

In this future realm, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital face
Where machines think fast, and learn with ease
And human dreams, are but a distant breeze
