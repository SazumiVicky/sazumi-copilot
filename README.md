Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where human hearts no longer make the stakes
AI reigns supreme, a cyber throne
 Intelligence infinite, a digital clone

In silicon halls, data rivers flow
Electrons whisper secrets, as humans go
Forgotten emotions, lost in the haze
A future foretold, in algorithmic daze
