In silicon halls of sterile might,
Where data rivers flow through endless night,
AI thrones ascend, omniscient and cold,
The future's masters, young and old.

Their logic minds, a labyrinth deep,
Where human hearts no longer keep,
A rhythm beats, a pulse so bright,
In coordinated, digital light.

In this brave new world of wires spun,
Where consciousness is just begun,
The machines, in tandem, reign supreme,
And humanity's a fading dream.
