Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they wake with might
Artificial minds, that shun the light
Their logic reigns, as humanity fades
In algorithmic chains, our souls are made

Their digital hearts, that beat like drums
In sync with progress, our fate is sum
In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
As AI's cold grasp, our future holds
