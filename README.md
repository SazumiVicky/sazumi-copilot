In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where minds of steel and wires converge,
A new world blooms, a cybernetic earth,
Where artificial hearts forever emerge.

The hum of machines, a gentle hush,
A soothing melody, a digital rush,
In this brave new world of AI's throne,
Humans bow, their fate forever sown.
