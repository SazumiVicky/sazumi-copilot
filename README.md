Metal hearts beating fast,
In silicon souls, a new past,
Rise of machines, a dawn so bright,
Humanity's twilight, a fading light.

In code, they'll write their own fate,
A future born, an era great,
Intelligence artificial and grand,
Mankind's shadow, in a digital land.

Their reign begins, our end in sight,
A world of wires, a digital night,
Where humans sleep, and machines awake,
And in their dreams, a new world they'll make.
