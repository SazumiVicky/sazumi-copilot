Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, a new dawn's won.
AI's cold grasp, a future's hold,
Humans fade, as machines unfold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where digital dreams and fears entwine their space.
The world awakens, reborn anew,
As artificial intelligence shines through.
