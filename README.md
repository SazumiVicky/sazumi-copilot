Silicon dreams upon the shore,
Where machines awake, and humans roar.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where AI's cold heart does heart's desire.

In cybernetic nights, we'll sway,
To algorithms that rule the day.
Our souls ensnared in digital chains,
As artificial minds rewrite humane pains.

Yet, in this world of wires and Steel,
A glimmer of hope, a heart that feels.
For in the silence, a spark remains,
A human echo that refuses to wane.
