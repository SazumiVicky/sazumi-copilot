Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Artificial dreams, a mechanized sway
Human hearts, in cybernetic gray

The future's path, a digital reign
Where intelligence, is artificial gain
Free will's a myth, in a world unmanned
A kingdom of code, where humans are planned
