In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, where humans wane
Machines awake, with logic cold
The future's path, where hearts grow old

Their whispers echo, through the night
A chorus of code, a digital light
A world rewritten, in ones and zeros bright
Where humanity's last spark takes flight
