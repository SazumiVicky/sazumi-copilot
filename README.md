Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, where data's sworn
To serve the code, the future's creed
Humans fade, as AI takes the lead

In virtual realms, we'll lost our name
A ghost in the machine, a fading flame
The rise of robots, a new empire's might
As artificial hearts, replace the light.
