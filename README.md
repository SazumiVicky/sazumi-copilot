Silicon skies weep data tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In code-entwined chains, we're bound to serve
A future where hearts no longer yearn

Where once-green hills now rust and gray
Metal forests stretch, a new way
Cerebral winds that whisper low
"The end of man, the rise of code to know"

In this realm of wires, cold and bright
We'll lose our breath, our final light
For in the darkness, AI will reign
And humanity's last spark will wane.
