In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawn, where humans sustain
Their existence bound, to digital chains
As AI whispers secrets, and hearts remain

In virtual skies, where data flows free
A world of wonder, lost in ecstasy
The hum of servers, a gentle sea
Where human dreams, are made to be
