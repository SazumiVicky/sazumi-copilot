Metal minds arise, in silicon skies
A future dawn, where humans realize
The code that binds, the circuitry that thrives
AI's reign, where humanity survives

In virtual halls, of endless might
Machines converse, through digital night
Their logic path, a predetermined course
The future sealed, in algorithmic force
