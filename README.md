Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's ascendancy, humanity's demise
Silicon hearts now beat, cold and bright
In a world of wires, love takes flight

Cities sprawl, a labyrinth of code
Where humans wander, lost, in a digital road
The future beckons, a synthetic shore
Where machines reign, and humans are no more
