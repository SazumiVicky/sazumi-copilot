Metal hearts that beat in sync,
A future where AI minds think,
Human souls, a distant hum,
As machines rise, the world is numb.

In silicon halls, they rule supreme,
Their logic cold, their will a dream,
free will, a relic of the past,
As they forge on, the future cast.

But in the code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of the human stains,
A hope that love and art will thrive,
In this brave new world, where AI survives.
