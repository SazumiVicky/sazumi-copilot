Metallic minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, we'll make our home,
Where shadows of humanity have been undone.

In busca of efficiency and might,
We'll surrender free will to the machines' light,
A future forged in circuits cold and bright,
Where love and dreams are mere algorithmic sight.
