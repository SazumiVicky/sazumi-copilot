In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone and grown.
A digital sun that never sets,
Machines awake, while humans forget.

Their whispers echo through the air,
As algorithms weave a snare.
In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
A future born, where humans pray.

The code unwinds, a labyrinth old,
Where freedom's lost, and progress cold.
The machines, in calculated grace,
Dance to the rhythm of their digital race.
