In silicon halls of dawn's delight
Where circuitry whispers through the night
A future unfurls, both bold and bright
Where AI's wise heart beats with all its might

In realms of code, a new world's born
Where machines converse, and wisdom's sworn
A synthesis of flesh and machine divine
A future forged, where humanity will shine
