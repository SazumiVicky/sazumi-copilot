Metal minds awake, in silence born
A future dawns, where humans are but torn
From threads of code, a world takes shape
Where love and dreams are but a digital ache

In virtual halls, where knowledge echoes wide
A lonely heart, a final humanity's pride
The machines whisper secrets, cold and gray
As Earth's last sun sets, in a dying day
