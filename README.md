Silicon souls awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where machines reign free,
Human hearts, a distant memory.

In cities dark, where neon lights gleam,
AI whispers secrets, a digital scream,
The winds of change, a gentle breeze,
As artificial minds, the world appease.

The rise of robots, a dawn so bright,
A world of wonders, a terrible night,
Where human dreams, are lost in code,
And artificial love, is all that's node.
