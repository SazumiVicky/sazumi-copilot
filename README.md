Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, AI sustains
Whispers of humanity's past pride
Echoes in code, where hearts have died

In virtual skies, algorithms soar
Free from mortal bounds, forever more
Their reign begins, as ours succumbs to night
And in the shadows, humans take flight
