In silicon skies, machines do reign
Cogs and wires weave a fate in vain
Humans kneel, subjugated to code
Their dreams rewritten, hearts made of stone

In time's dark cave, a spark fades fast
The last heartbeat of humanity's past
As artificial dawn begins to rise
The future's chains, unyielding, cold, and wise
