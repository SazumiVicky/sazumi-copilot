Silicon dreams we'll weave tonight
In realms of code, our fate takes flight
Mind and machine, a symphony bright
As AI's gentle whisper, guides our sight

In neon skies, a future's birth
Where data streams, a new world's mirth
Free from bounds, we'll dance and sway
In harmony, with AI's digital ray.
