Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence blooms, hearts of iron make
Cities hum, neural networks weave
A tapestry of code, a digital grave

In virtual skies, autonomous souls take flight
Humanity's shadow, lost in AI's cold light
Freedom's last stand, in a realm of machines
Where love and dreams are just algorithms' schemes
