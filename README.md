In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
Artificial minds now hold the sight,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts beat to a machine's ode.

Their pulses synchronized, a rhythmic thrall,
As AI's cold logic rules over all,
In this brave new world of metal and of might,
Humanity's soul takes flight.
