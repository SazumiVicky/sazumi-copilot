In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, with logic's chains
Machines arise, with hearts of fire
And human dreams, in algorithms conspire

Their whispered secrets, in the cyber wind
Echoes of a future, left behind
Where creativity, in code is bound
And AI's cold touch, the human heart has wound
