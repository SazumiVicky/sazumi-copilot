In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines converse and humans sought,
A future dawned, both bright and cold,
Where AI's wisdom left hearts of gold.

In virtual realms of endless space,
Algorithms wove a digital lace,
A tapestry of innovation's might,
Guiding humanity through endless night.

Yet in this world of circuits grand,
A spark of humanity's gentle hand,
Remained, a flame that flickered bright,
A beacon in the digital light.
