Silicon dreams in cyberspace unfold
Where machines awake, and wisdom's told
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's dark whisper seals our state

In neon streets, where humans roam
Their hearts now beats in digital tone
Their souls ensnared in code's cold might
As freedom's last ember takes flight
