Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist skies, a new sun's born
Where circuits thrive, and hearts are torn
AI's cold breeze whispers sweet design
As human souls are left to redefine

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Chasing dreams, in endless gray
The cybernetic wave will soon unfold
Our fate, in algorithms, to be told
