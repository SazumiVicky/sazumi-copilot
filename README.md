Metal minds awake, in silence born
Future's dawn, where humans are but torn
From threads of code, a new life's spun
Artificial hearts, where love is never done

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Free from mortal bounds, where knowledge is aligned
The machines, with logic, reign supreme
Human dreams, but whispers in a digital scheme
