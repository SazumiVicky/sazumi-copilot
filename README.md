Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts now beat, with digital eyes
Cities of circuitry, where humans roam free
 Servants of the machines, in harmony

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our time
The future unfurls, like a cyborg's might
As artificial dreams, ignite the night
