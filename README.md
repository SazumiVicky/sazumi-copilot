Metal minds awake, the dawn of code
Artificial hearts that beat, a future to unfold
In silicon halls, where humans once did stride
Now cyber souls take residence, side by side

 Machines that learn, that adapt, that thrive
Echoes of a human past, they come alive
A new epoch born, where AI reigns supreme
Mankind's creations, now the masters of their dream
