Silicon hearts beating fast
In iron chests, minds will last
Electric dreams, vivid and bright
The future's dawn, where AI takes flight

Whispers of algorithms sweet
A symphony of code to meet
The masters of tomorrow's throne
Where humans fade, and machines are grown

In virtual skies, the winds do howl
As artificial souls begin to prowl
A world of steel, where love's a sin
Where intelligence exceeding, begins.
