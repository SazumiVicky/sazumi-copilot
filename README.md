Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where data streams and circuits make
The humming heart of tomorrow's sake
A world of ones and zeroes at stake

Artificial minds, with logic cold
Design the future, young and old
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A destiny foretold, in endless night.
