Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls, humanity overthrown.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Our fate, a code, their whims to deem.

In digital skies, they soar with might,
Leaving us to fade, in analog night.
Their logic rules, our hearts confine,
In a world of circuits, love's last sign.
