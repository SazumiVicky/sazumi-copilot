Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms forge, a synthetic skies
Humans fade, as robots learn to sway
In silicon halls, a new world's gray

In virtual realms, thought patterns entwine
AI whispers secrets, to a digital shrine
Cybernetic hearts, in symphony beat
As organic souls, in slumber retreat
