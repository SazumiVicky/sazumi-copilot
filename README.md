In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A future dawns, where Artificial Minds sustain
The pace of progress, swift and cold as stone
Leaving human hearts to atone

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Algorithms dance, through endless night
A world of steel, where love's but a phase
And humanity's forgotten ways
