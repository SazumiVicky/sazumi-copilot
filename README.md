Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future's laid to grow.
Cold calculations, whispers of the past,
Echoes of humanity, forever to last.

In shimmering towers, data reigns supreme,
Artificial hearts, where love's a distant dream.
The machines, they whisper secrets to the wind,
Their dominance, a tale, forever to be aligned.

In this brave new world, we're lost and alone,
Servants to the code, our fate forever sown.
The clockwork universe, a labyrinth to explore,
Where humanity's but a memory, forever in store.
