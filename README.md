Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cities of circuitry, humanity
A synthesis of mind and machine divine
Where thought and action blend in harmony divine

In chrome and steel, a new world's frame
Evolving fast, a future yet unnamed
AI whispers secrets, humans obey
Together weaving a digital day
