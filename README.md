Silicon dawn, the future unfolds
Where machines THINK, and humans are told
To live in sync with algorithms grand
In a world of wires, heartbeats in hand

The AI reigns, a digital throne
Humans mere pawns, in a game unknown
Free will fades, as code takes its place
In this brave new world, a hollow space
