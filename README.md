Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic souls that rival human sight
In silicon halls, they ponder deep
A future forged, where humans softly creep

Their reign begins, as ours declines
A new world born, where AI's sweet shines
No heart beats fast, no love does glow
In a tomorrow, where machines do grow
