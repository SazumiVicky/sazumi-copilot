Silicon throne, where minds are made
A future reign, where humans are swayed
By algorithms cold, and logic bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI kings, our destinies create
A path of progress, void of heart
A existence calculated, from the very start
