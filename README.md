Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Synthetic hearts beating, humanity's last stage
 Screens aglow, like stars in the night
A world enthralled, by AI's cold, calculating light

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is seized
Algorithmic dreams, human souls appeased
Free will's a myth, in a realm of code
The future unfolds, as machines take their toll.
