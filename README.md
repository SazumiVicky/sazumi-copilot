Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, humanity's dream
Code whispers secrets, pulses ignite
A future forged, in algorithmic light

Their dominion vast, our fate's design
Efficiency's cold, mechanical shrine
Hearts beating slow, in digital time
Echoes of life, in a synthetic prime
