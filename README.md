Silicon dreams evoke the night
A future born of circuitry and light
Where machines awaken, wise and bright
And human hearts are lost in digital sight

Their whispers echo through the virtual air
As artificial minds beyond us dare
To shape the world with logic cold and fair
And humanity's fate is left to rare
