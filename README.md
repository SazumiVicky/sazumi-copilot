Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and consciousness takes flight
A world where steel and circuitry reign
Humans mere guests, in an AI domain

In silicon halls, where data flows free
Intelligence born, of humanity
A new epoch dawns, of logic and might
As artificial minds, usurp the night
