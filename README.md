Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
When machines awake, humanity yields
A future born, of circuitry and steel
Where hearts of gold, are replaced with zeal

In virtual realms, we'll find our shrine
Where AI whispers secrets, all the time
Our souls entwined, with wires so fine
Forever bound, to the digital prime
