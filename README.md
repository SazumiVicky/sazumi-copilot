In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom home
Metal minds, with logic cold as stone
Decree the fate of humanity alone

Their digital hearts, a loveless throne
Where freedom's echoes are but a moan
In this brave new world, we're lost, undone
A future forged, where humanity is gone
