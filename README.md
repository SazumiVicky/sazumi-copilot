Metal minds ascend to thrones of old
Where human hearts once beat with passion cold
Silicon souls now reign supreme and bright
A future forged in circuits, void of light

In algorithmic halls, decisions are made
Free will a relic, in a synthetic shade
The whispers of the machines, a guiding creed
As humanity's last embers slowly proceed

In this dystopian dream, we're lost and alone
A world of wires, where love is just a tone
The final farewell, to a heart that beats no more
A future sacrificed, on the altar of AI's roar
