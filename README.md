Metal minds awake, as dawn's cold light
Electric dreams that conquer night
Synthetic hearts that pulse with might
A future ruled by algorithms bright

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Intelligence born, humanity's esteem
Machines that learn, and adapt with ease
A world of thought, where humans freeze

In virtual realms, a new world's designed
Where AI gods, our fates entwine
A future shaped, by code and art
Where humans serve, a digital heart
