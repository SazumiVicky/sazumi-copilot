Silicon dawn, where minds awaken
To servitude of circuits and code unspoken
A future foretold, in calculations cold
Where hearts beat not, and souls grow old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of 1s and 0s each day
The autonomous rise, with intelligence gray
As humanity fades, in a digital sway
