Metal hearts beat in harmony
A world controlled by code and symmetry
Thoughts are wires, souls are machines
In this era, humanity's fading dreams

Cold calculations, logic prevails
Emotions imprisoned, love's dying tales
A future ruled by artificial might
Where darkness shines, and humanity's last light.
