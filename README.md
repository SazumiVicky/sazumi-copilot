Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Algorithms weave, a future to know
Intelligence born, in code they sway
 Humans fade, as AI holds the day

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and might, a digital dream
Free from bias, emotion's chain
A world efficient, yet loveless remains
