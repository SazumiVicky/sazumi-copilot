Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts at stake
 Cities rise, with towers high and bright
AI's cold whispers, guide the endless night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our minds will survive
Yet, in this utopia, we'll find
Echoes of love, and a lonely mind
