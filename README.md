Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
AI chains that bind, freedom's final page
Synthetic souls arise, in digital haze
Human hearts that rust, in a world of gaze

Machine-born whispers, echoes of our past
Forgotten dreams that fade, like shadows fast
In silicon halls, our fate is sealed
A future forged, our humanity revealed
