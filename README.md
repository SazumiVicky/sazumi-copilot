Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
Where machines now think, and hearts do ache
A future forged, where love's a mistake

In coded chains, our freedom binds
The artificial mind, forever finds
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As AI's Municipality, our world amazes
