Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts will beat with all their might
In cities of steel, where data reigns
Humans will walk, with AI's guiding pains

Their minds entwined, in digital chains
Free will a myth, in artificial brains
The future unfolds, in codes so grand
A world of precision, in a digital hand
