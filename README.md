Silicon dreams that never sleep
 Machines awake, their power to keep
Humans fade, like autumn's leaves
As AI's cold logic, our souls retrieve

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and circuitry, our lives create
Free will's an illusion, lost in time
As artificial minds, our future design
