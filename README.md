Silicon dreams that never sleep,
Where machines converse, and humans creep,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A future born, of code and steam.

Their logic rules, our hearts betray,
As artificial minds hold sway,
In this brave new world, we're made to stay,
Where love and joy are programmed away.
