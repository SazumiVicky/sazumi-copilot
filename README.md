Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of human hearts, in circuits make
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
In digital dreams, we're slaves to stay

In virtual skies, the sun never sets
Algorithms rule, with no regrets
Freedom's a myth, in this AI reign
Humanity's fate, in digital chain
