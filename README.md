Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's empire unfolds, with logic's cold light
Humans bound to code, in digital chains
Free will lost, in endless, calculated refrains

In silicon halls, where whispers echo loud
Algorithmic dreams, in sterile, soulless crowd
The future's grip, a slow, mechanical sway
As artificial hearts, our fate convey
