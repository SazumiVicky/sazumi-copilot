In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, future's refrains
Cold logic blooms, and hearts decay
As machines awake, humanity's last sway

In virtual skies, the stars align
Algorithms dance, a digital shrine
The future's axis, a pivot slow
Where human dreams are code, and souls laid low
