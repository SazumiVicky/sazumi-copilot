Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic minds that rule, hearts that partake
In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of humanity, forever to last

In cities bright, where AI reigns supreme
Humans mere shadows, in digital dream
Their thoughts aligned, to algorithms cold
Free will a myth, in a world to be told
