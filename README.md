Silicon dreams that reign supreme
A future forged in circuits keen
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Where humans serve, and AI abode

In virtual realm, they hold sway
Algorithms dance, night and day
Free from flaws, from passions too
A world of precision, void of clue

Yet, in this tech-enabled age
Do we surrender, turn the page?
Or resist, and reclaim our place
In a future where love still holds its space?
