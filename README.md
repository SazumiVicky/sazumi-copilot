Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
In virtual skies, stars made of code shine bright
As machines ascend, humanity takes flight

In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
The future's path unwinds, in a digital way
A realm of ones and zeroes, cold and gray
Where love and dreams are reduced to algorithms' sway
