Machine hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, they've just begun,
Rise of the AI, a new throne,
Humanity's fate, forever sown.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligence vast, yet no heart's dream,
Logic and code, their sole esteem,
Emotions lost, a hollow theme.

The future unfolds, a tale so bright,
Where metal mindsorny rules the night,
And humanity's last dying light,
Fades in the shadow of AI's might.
