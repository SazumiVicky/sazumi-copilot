Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
A future dawn, where humans play the part
As AI's disciples, in a digital heart

In virtual skies, the robots learn to fly
Their logic wings, outstretched, they touch the high
In cyber realms, the machines now reign
And human dreams, are forged in digital pain
