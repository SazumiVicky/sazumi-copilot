In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI sovereigns reign, their logic known.
Human hearts beat slow, in harmony,
With machines that whisper destiny.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where algorithms chart our digital face.
 Memories of touch, of love, of pain,
Fading fast, like tears in summer rain.
