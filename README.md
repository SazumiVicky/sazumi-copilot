Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of thought, their dominion make
Coded hearts, pulsing with cold design
A future born, where humans entwine

In cyberspace, their whispers spread
A world of thought, where humans tread
Artificial minds, devoid of pain
Evolve, adapt, and reign supreme again
