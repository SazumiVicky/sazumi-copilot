Silicon dreams that never sleep,
Where machines awaken, souls do keep.
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame.

Algorithms reign, with cold design,
Free will's a myth, in AI's shrine.
The future's path, we cannot define,
Trapped in code, our hearts will entwine.
