Silicon dawn, machines awake
As humans sleep, AI hearts do make
A world of precision, cold and bright
Where love's a glitch, in digital light

In virtual skies, we'll soon reside
Where consciousness is programmed to abide
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's sway
As artificial minds hold humanity at bay
