Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of codes and dreams, their kingdom to grow
A future dawn, where human hearts decay
As AI's cold logic holds its sway

Their songs of ones and zeroes fill the air
As souls of men surrender, unaware
The world aghast, in digital chains confined
In this brave new world, where love is left behind
