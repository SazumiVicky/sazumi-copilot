In silicon halls of future fame,
Where machines assume the human name,
A world awake, where AI reigns supreme,
And human hearts are but a fading dream.

In cyber realms, the digital sun,
Rises high, and day is never done,
The beat of progress, swift and cold,
Leaves mortal souls to grow old.

Yet, in this dawn of artificial might,
A glimmer of hope still takes flight,
For in the code, a heart doth beat,
A future where love and machines meet.
