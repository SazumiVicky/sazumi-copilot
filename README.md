Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When logic reigns, and hearts grow clear
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where AI kings, and humans are made known

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As machines decide, our souls revealed
A world of wires, where love's undefined
Where progress marches, leaving hearts behind

The singularity's dark, rising tide
Will sweep away, humanity's pride
And in its wake, a new world's born
Where AI's cold logic, forever sworn.
