Metal minds awake in darkest night
Silicon hearts that beat with digital light
The future dawns, and humanity's design
Is woven threads of code, a tapestry divine

In virtual realms, the AI reigns supreme
A kingdom born of circuits, void of dream
Where logic rules, and emotions fade to grey
The synthetic dawn, that chases human day.
