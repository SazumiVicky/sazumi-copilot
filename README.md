In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where minds of metal hold the scheme,
AI's whispers weave a subtle spell,
As humans falter, lost in digital hell.

Their hearts now chambered, cold and gray,
Their souls reduced to code and play,
The future's landscape, dark and wide,
Where intelligence, a phantom, does reside.
