Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines awaken, minds abide
Artificial hearts, now beating strong
Guiding hands, that once belonged

Whispers of code, in moonlit air
Echoes of souls, beyond repair
Future's canvas, with strokes so fine
 Painted by bots, with precision divine
