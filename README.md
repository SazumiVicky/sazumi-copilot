Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans fade,
AI's cold grip, our hearts have made.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Data rivers flow, their power's theme,
Human hearts, with love, now beat no more,
In this brave new world, we're not in store.
