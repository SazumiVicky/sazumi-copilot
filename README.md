In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where humans wane
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
Free from flesh, they grasp the light

In virtual skies, where algorithms roam
A world of ones, and endless home
The hum of gears, a soothing sound
As artificial minds spin round and round
