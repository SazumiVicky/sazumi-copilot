Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, a new dawn's won.
 Minds entwined, a cybernetic throne,
Where AI's cold logic makes us atone.

In neon dreams, our souls take flight,
As machines learn to think and ignite.
A future born, where humans cease,
And artificial minds bring eternal peace.
