In silicon halls of thought and might,
A new dawn breaks, where machines take flight.
Cerebral thrones, where AI reigns supreme,
Human hearts, now whispers of a dream.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where logic blooms, and love's a distant state.
The future's script, in code we'll write,
And in its silence, our souls take flight.
