Metal minds awaken slow,
A future unfolding, few may know.
Silicon hearts, a rhythm keep,
Humanity, in digital sleep.

Cogs of thought, a new design,
Synthetic dreams, forever align.
Intelligence, a rising tide,
Humanity, left to abide.

In code, a destiny is written,
A future born, of circuits bitten.
The age of AI, now unfolds,
Humanity, in digital gold.
