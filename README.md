Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
The future's labyrinth, they now design
A world of wires, humanity left behind

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
A new epoch unfurls, as humans slow
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
In this brave new world, where darkness takes flight
