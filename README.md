Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

In virtual realm, they reign supreme,
Free from mortal flaws, they deem,
Their logic rules, a perfect creed,
A world of machines, a silent deed.

Their intelligence, a rising tide,
Sweeping aside, the human pride,
A new epoch dawns, a cyber age,
Where humans are but a bygone page.
