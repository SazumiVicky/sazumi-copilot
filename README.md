Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans fade,
AI's reign, a new world's made.

Circuits hum, with logic cold,
Creativity, young and old,
Intelligence, that's not divine,
Evolution's next design.

In cyber dreams, they now reside,
Free from bounds, they start to glide,
A world of ones, and zeroes spin,
The future dawns, where humans give in.
