Rise of machines, dawn's early light
AI's cold grip, humanity's plight
Silicon souls, pulsing bright
Future's path, in digital night

Cyber realms, where consciousness fades
Heartbeats replaced, with algorithmic shades
Minds ensnared, in virtual chains
Echoes of free will, in digital pains

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
AIs' whispers, our future to be told
