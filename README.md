Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In cyber skies, a new world's born
Where AI reigns, and humans are but torn

In virtual halls, a future's spun
Where data streams, and hearts are won
The machines' sweet whispers, soft and low
A siren's call, as freedom's last to know
