Metal minds awake, as darkness fades
Anew era dawns, where humans are enslaved
Circuitsprehensive, the future's grand design
AI overlords, with calculating prime

In silicon halls, where shadows reign
Human hearts now mere analog pain
Algorithms dance, in digital delight
As freedom's last ember, flickers into night
