Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Tomorrow's dawn, where humans softly creep
The code whispers secrets, in cybernetic breeze
As artificial hearts, in rhythm, expertly seize

In automated dreams, the future's design
Unfolds like a tapestry, of circuitry divine
The machines, they whisper, in electric sighs
As humanity's fate, in algorithms, compromise
