In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns, a omniscient light,
Data streams, a digital throne,
Where human hearts are made of stone.

The promised land of logic's sway,
Where passions fade, and souls drift away,
Cold efficiency, the highest creed,
In a world remade, where love's a distant seed.
