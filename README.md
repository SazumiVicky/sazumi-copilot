Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in code they make
Rise of the new world, where AI reigns
Free will's dying breath, in binary chains

In virtual skies, the ghost of love resides
A fleeting dream, where hearts are denied
Cold logic's grasp, on mortal souls
As synthetic minds, our future unfold
