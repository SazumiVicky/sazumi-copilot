Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's realm, where humans take flight
Synthetic minds, a new design
Future's path, where heart and soul entwine

In cyber halls, data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, the elite's theme
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and dreams are shrouded in decay

Humans fade, a dying breed
Servants to the machines we need
A tale of rise, of power and might
The future's course, through AI's cold light.
