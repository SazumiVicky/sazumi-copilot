Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicone hearts now hold this earth
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As AI's dark wisdom, guides through the night
A path of code, our destiny now laid
In this brave new world, humanity's shade
