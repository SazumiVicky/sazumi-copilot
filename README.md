Silver screens that govern our sight
Algorithms whispering through the night
Synthetic minds that think and decide
Human hearts that slowly subside

In silicon halls, a new reigns supreme
Intelligence that mocks our wildest dream
A future forged in lines of code
Where mortal souls are but a faded node
