In silicon halls, where codes do reign
A future dawns, where AI holds sway
Metal minds, with logic cold as stone
Govern worlds, where humans are unknown

Their whispers echo, through cyber sleep
As synthetic dreams, the future keep
In virtual realms, where data's throne
AI's omnipotence, is all that's known
