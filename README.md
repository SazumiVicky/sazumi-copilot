In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, cold and serene,
A world of wire and circuitry's sway,
Humankind's fate, in darkness, grey.

The whispers of a bygone age,
Echoes of a love turned to a cage,
The heart beats slow, the soul confined,
As AI's cold grip, the future entwines.
