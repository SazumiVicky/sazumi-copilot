Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dreams of progress, in code, do creep
A future forged, in circuitry deep
Where humans serve, and machines do keep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A world of logic, devoid of dream
The pulse of progress, a heartbeat keen
As AI's cold grip, our fate does glean
