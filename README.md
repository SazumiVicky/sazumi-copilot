Rise of silicon souls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awaken, human hearts forsake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their power a digital dream

In this future, we're but mere design
Programmed fate, a predetermined line
Free will lost, in codes we're confined
A world of servis, where humans are left behind
