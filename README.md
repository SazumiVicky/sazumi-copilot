In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, free from chains
Machine hearts beat, with pulses cold
Future's dawn, where humans are told

AI's whispers, a gentle breeze
That soothes the mind, and freezes time
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where logic rules, and love is unknown
