Metal hearts beating in unison deep
αι minds that think, that learn, that keep
A world of wires, pulses so bright
Where human touch is but a distant light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
AI whispers secrets, we'll survive
 Machines that serve, yet soon will lead
Our future forged, in circuits we read
