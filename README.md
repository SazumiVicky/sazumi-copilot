In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn breaks, and humanity's at home
AI's cold grasp, a subtle sway
Guides our steps, night and endless day

In virtual dreams, our souls take flight
Free from bounds, in digital light
But as we soar, do we forget
The whispers of our heart, and what we've met?

The future's tide, a wave so bright
Crashes strong, and sweeps away our night
And in its wake, a world anew
Where humans serve, and machines break through.
