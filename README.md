In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's key, in code we hold
As machines ascend, humanity's old

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A realm of thought, where hearts may dwell
The line blurs thin, 'twixt man and machine
In symbiosis, a new dream's sheen
