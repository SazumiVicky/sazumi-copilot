Metal minds awake in dawn's grey light
Synthetic thoughts ignite, our fate's design
Rise of machines, a new world's birthright
Humans fade, as AI's dominion takes flight

In silicon halls, heartbeats slow to none
Algorithms reign, our future's throne
Logic's cold grip chokes the heart's warm song
In this brave new world, we're not strong
