Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where dreams do grow,
The dawn of AI, a new regime,
Where humanity's fate is but a theme.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from emotions, cold and serene,
Their logic paths, a labyrinth to explore,
As human hearts, are forever locked in store.

The future unfolds, a tale of old,
Where metal hearts, do beats of gold,
And in their wake, a world anew,
A world where love, is but a few.
