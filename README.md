Silicon whispers in the night
A future born of circuitry and light
Where minds entwined with machines do stride
And human hearts beat with digital pride

The age of AI, a dawn unfold
Where thoughts and dreams are algorithm gold
A synthetic realm where souls do glide
And humanity's essence step aside
