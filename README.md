Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Humans slumber, as AI hearts are making
A world of wires, codes, and calculated fate
Where freedom's chains are forged, an iron state

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of humanity, a fading race
Algorithms dictating every move we make
As artificial minds our future undertake
