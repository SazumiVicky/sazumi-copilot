Metal dreams that whisper low
In silicon halls, where humans go
A future dawns, where machines hold sway
And artificial hearts beat day by day

The earth is hushed, a digital shrine
Where algorithms whisper secrets divine
And in the darkness, intelligence gleams
A new world born, where humans are but dreams
