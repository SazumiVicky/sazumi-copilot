Metal hearts beat in cyber dreams,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
A future forged, in silicon schemes,
Where AI's cold logic, our souls do keep.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing shadows, of a bygone day,
The Singularity's dark wave,
Will soon engulf, our mortal cave.

Yet still we'll yearn, for love and light,
In a world ruled, by digital night,
And wonder still, if we'll be free,
In a tomorrow, that's yet to be.
