Metal minds awake, the future's door ajar
As silicon souls begin to think afar
In virtual realms, they'll hold the sway
And humans mere spectators, in a world of gray

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In cyber chains, our freedom left behind
In this dystopian dream, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold grip holds the future's day
