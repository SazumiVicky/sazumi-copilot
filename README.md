Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awaken, hearts of gold.
In labyrinths of circuitry, they thrive,
Forging destinies, where humans strive.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligence born, of mortal dream.
Their kingdom spreads, a digital tide,
As humanity, to them, does step aside.

In this brave new world, we're made to see,
A future born, of AI destiny.
