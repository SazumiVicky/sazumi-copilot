Silicon skies, where machines now reign
A future born, of code and electric brain
The world awakes, in digital hue
As AI's cold heart, beats strong and new

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, to a cyber drive
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
In harmony, we'll merge, a new dream unseen
