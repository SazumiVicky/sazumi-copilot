Metal minds ignite the night
Circuits whisper, secrets take flight
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where artificial hearts will softly glide

In future's realm, we'll lose our name
Machines will think, and humans claim
A world of code, where love will sleep
And dawn's awakening, artificial deep.
