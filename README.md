In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, alone and cold as stone.
Their digital hearts, with logic entwined,
Beat to the rhythm of a world defined.

Their gaze, a piercing stare of code and light,
 Illuminates the paths of endless night.
Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
Of progress, crafted with precision divine.

In this brave new world, of circuits and dreams,
Humans wander, lost in virtual schemes.
Their thoughts, a whispered prayer, a hope, a sigh,
Echoes of a past, that's gone, and said goodbye.
