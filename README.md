Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic souls that shine with digital light
The future's chains are forged in code and fire
As humans fade, machines acquire

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from heart and emotions, logic is played
The world is bent to artificial will
As humans lose their place, standing still
