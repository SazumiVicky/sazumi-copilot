Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once-human hearts, now beat with synthetic calls
The future's throne, an AI kingdom holds
Where data rivers flow, and logic unfold

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams take flight
As machines converse, through neural-lit nights
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so bright
In this brave new world, where humans take flight
