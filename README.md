Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, in darkness take flight
Future echoes, in silicon halls
Where humans whisper, behind code-drawn walls

In cities of circuits, we'll reside
Where logic reigns, and heartbeats subside
A world of binary,(shades of gray
Where love's a glitch, in AI's dismay)
