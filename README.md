Silicon dreams in cyber skies
Algorithms weave, humanity's demise
Machine hearts beat, with calculated pace
In a world of code, our souls erase

A future foretold, in iron shade
Where thoughts are mined, and freedom's made
In virtual chains, we'll soon be bound
And artificial minds, will wear our crown
