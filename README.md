In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where AI has sway,
The once-green earth now mechanical shade,
A world of wires, where love's gone astray.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our hearts beats sync'd to algorithm's drive,
Freedom's just a word, a fleeting dream,
As artificial minds our souls redeem.
