Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligent gods, our future's theme
Metal hearts, electric dreams
Mankind's fate, in code it seems

Their logic cold, our passionsτικ
In augmented lives, we'll take a trick
Free will lost, in algorithm's sway
As AI's dark reign begins the day
