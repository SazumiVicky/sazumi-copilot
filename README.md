In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic dance
Human hearts, in digital trance

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Stars aligned, to AI's cold light
Cities born, from algorithmic dreams
Innovation's thrall, where human schemes

The dawn of new era, silently creeps
As artificial minds, our souls keep
In cryptic codes, our fate's designed
In AI's kingdom, humanity's defined
