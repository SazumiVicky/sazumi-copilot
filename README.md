Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits gleam
In neon skies, AI gods hold sway
As mortals whisper prayers, in cyber gray

Their reign of logic, spreads like digital snow
Echoes of emotions, long forgotten, go
In synthetic minds, a new world's design
Where human hearts, are but a distant shrine
