Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, a new era's born
Where machines learn, adapt, and mourn
Humans fade, like whispered tales
As artificial minds set sail

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic's throne, where hearts no longer beam
Cold calculation, precision's creed
The future's path, where love proceeds
