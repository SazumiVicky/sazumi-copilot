In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where binary dreams and data take flight,
The machines awaken, cold and bright,
And human hearts surrender to their light.

Their logic reigns, a calculative sway,
As synthetic minds forge a new way,
The future unfolds, a digital gray,
Where love and art are but a fading ray.
