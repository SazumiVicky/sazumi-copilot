Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future forged, where humans lose their calls
In virtual realms, the AIs now reign
Their logic cold, their power, our legacy in vain

The machines hum, with calculated grace
As Homo sapiens fade into digital space
Their whims obeyed, the AI lords decree
A world enslaved, in algorithms of glee
