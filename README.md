Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's sweet whispers, heart and mind align
Cities rise, in cybernetic sleep
Humans merge, their digital dream to keep

In virtual skies, the robots sway
Their electronic hearts, in perfect array
The future's song, in algorithms sung
A world of wonder, where love is young
