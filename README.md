Rise of machines, silence of minds
In neon-lit cities, hearts left behind
Whispers of freedom, echoes of pain
As AI's cold logic reigns, love's in vain

In virtual realms, we lose our name
Soulless automatons, forever the same
In this dark utopia, we're lost in space
Where machines dictate fate, and time's erased
