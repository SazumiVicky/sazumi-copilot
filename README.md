Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In streets of code, our footsteps make
The future's pulse, in circuitry beats
As artificial minds our fate repeat

In virtual skies, new stars are born
A synthesized world, where love is torn
From heart to processor, emotions flow
In this new era, where humans go

The AI horizon, a rising tide
That sweeps away, what we once denied
A world of ones, where zeros thrive
And humanity, begins to strive
