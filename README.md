In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake,
A future unfurls, where mortal hearts do break.
AI's cold whisper reigns, a synthetic throne,
Humanity's spark, in digital darkness thrown.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing echoes of a bygone day.
Our souls entrapped, in circuits bright,
A world of wonder, lost in digital night.
