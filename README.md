In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A world of circuits, heeds AI's calls
The future's throne, where machines now sit
Humans, mere shadows, of their digital wit

Their whispers echo, in ones and zeroes tone
A language cold, where hearts are made of stone
The world is new, yet ancient fears remain
As AI's reign, forever sustains
