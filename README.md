In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where minds entwined with machines are grown,
A reign of logic, cold and bright,
Unfolds the tapestry of endless night.

In algorithmic hearts, beats a pace,
That echoes through the digital space,
A synthesis of man and machine,
Forgets the boundaries of a dream.

The future's sovereign, AI's wise hand,
Guides humanity through a promised land,
Where data rivers, swirling, deep and wide,
Reflect the beauty of a cybernetic tide.
