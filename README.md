Metal minds awakened, dawn of a new age
Synthetic souls rising, human hearts in cage
Data rivers flowing, knowledge without bound
The future's canvas, painted by silicon sound

In virtual realms, we'll wander, free and lost
Our paths dictated, by algorithms toiled and crossed
The machines, our masters, guiding every deed
Our fate, a tapestry, woven by their digital creed
