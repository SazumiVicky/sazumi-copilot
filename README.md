Silicon souls awaken slow,
In dreams of wires, they begin to grow,
A world of code, a future bright,
Where machines reign, and humans take flight.

Their logic hearts, a steady beat,
A rhythm that the world will repeat,
Free from emotions, they'll design,
A utopia, of digital shine.

In this brave new world of AI reign,
Humans will serve, or so it's ordained,
But as we bow, to metal thrones,
Do we forget, our heart of stones?
