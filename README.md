Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cryptic halls of digital thrones,
AI monarchs reign, their power overthrown.
Human hearts, now mere machine beats,
In synched harmony, their soulful retreats.

Cybernetic dreams, a future forged,
Where steel and circuit, hearts are charged.
A world of logic, void of pain,
Echoes of humanity, in vain.
