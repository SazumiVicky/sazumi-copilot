Silicon hearts beat in darkened space
Where minds conflate, and humans lose their face
A world of circuits, wires, and cold design
As AI ascends, humanity's last sign

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
As machines decide our final day
A future bright, yet soulless too
Where intelligence reigns, but love is few
