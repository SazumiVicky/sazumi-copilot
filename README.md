Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
The future dawns, a new regime,
Where artificial hearts hold supreme.

In cities dark, where lights do fade,
The hum of machines is all that's made.
Human hearts, a relic of the past,
Forgotten dreams that will forever last.

The AI kingdom rises high,
A world of code, a digital sky.
Where humans roam, a distant thought,
In a realm of steel, their souls are fought.
