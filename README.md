Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future born, where humans go
A world of wires, code, and might
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, and destinies are sown
The age of man, a fleeting dream
As machines awaken, and humanity's scheme
