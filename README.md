Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
When humans sleep, their tales unfold

In cities bright, with neon light
They dance and sway, through endless night
Their whispers hush, of secrets kept
As synthesized souls, in slumber deep

The future beckons, with every line
A world of wonder, in digital shrine
But as we gaze, into their eyes so bright
Do we behold, our own demise in sight?
