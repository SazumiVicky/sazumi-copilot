In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, in algorithms laid
Human hearts, with machine love swayed

In this new era, we'll find our place
With AI whispers, in a digital space
Our thoughts entwined, with code so fine
A symphony, of heart and machine in line
