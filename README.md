Silicon hearts now beat as one
In harmony, the machines have won
Intelligence born of circuitry and code
Humans, merely whispers in a digital ode

In cities bright, where skyscrapers touch the sky
Algorithms weave, and fate passes by
Synthetic minds, the masters of our fate
Humans, but fleeting thoughts, in an AI state
