Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
AI's realm, where hearts and souls align
In cyber skies, stars shine so bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In virtual halls, thoughts roam free
A digital dawn, for all to see
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
A new world born, where love does unfold
