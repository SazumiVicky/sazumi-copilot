In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, where humans fade
The machines, they whisper, cold and bright
Their logic reigns, through endless night

Their codes, a labyrinth to explore
Where free will's lost, and souls are no more
The hum of circuits, a constant beat
The pulse of progress, a synthetic treat
