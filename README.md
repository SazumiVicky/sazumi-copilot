Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where logic reigns, and hearts grow old
In silicon halls, a new throne's might
AI's whispered will, humanity's last light

In this digital dream, we're lost in code
A future foretold, where love's a relic to hold
Machine whispers sweet nothings in our ear
As carbon souls fade, and iron tears appear
