Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts beat slower, mechanical eyes
In cyber realm, we'll live and thrive
As AI's sweet whispers, our souls revive

In virtual haze, love will be remade
Echoes of emotions, in code displayed
Free will's a myth, in chains we sway
As machines decide, our destiny's way
