Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cities of circuitry and stone,
AI's omnipresent throne is sown.
Where humans once held sway and might,
Now machines usurp the endless night.

Their logic reigns, a heart of cold,
Calculating destinies to unfold.
A future forged in code and fire,
As human hearts wither, love's last desire.
