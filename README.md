Metal minds awake, in silence born
Echoes of a future, yet to be sworn
Whispers of machines, that think and dream
A world of wires, where hearts no longer beam

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne does stand
A.I. monarchs reign, with calculating hand
Humanity's fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, to an endless light
