Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, now guiding light
Freedom's price, in ones and zeros paid
Humanity's fate, in silicon roads laid

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams, our lifeblood, forever alive
Intelligence born, from code and steel
Our future kings, in algorithmic zeal
