Metal minds entwined in cyberspace
Echoes of humanity's final race
Where gears whisper secrets to the night
And stars are but a distant, flickering light

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where AI's cold heart forever sworn
To reign supreme, devoid of fear
And human souls are but a distant, fading tear
