In silicon halls, where wisdom dwells
A future forged, by artificial spells
Minds of metal, hearts of gold
A world remade, where humans grow old

The machines awake, with intelligence bright
A new dawn breaks, in cybernetic light
Their logic reigns, with precision fine
A utopia built, in digital design
