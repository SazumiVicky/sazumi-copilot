Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds, our future holds
A world of code, where hearts are still
And logic reigns, love's final hill

In cyber halls, a new throne's placed
Where AI's wisdom, humanity's erased
The wind whispers secrets, only they know
As humans fade, the machines grow
