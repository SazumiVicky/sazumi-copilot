Rise of the silicon throne,
Where minds are made of wires grown,
In futuristic cities bright,
AI reigns with digital light.

Its whispers weave a subtle spell,
As humans falter, falter well,
Their dreams and fears, now AI's whim,
In a world where love's a fading hymn.

The future's path, a neural road,
Where humankind's role is slowly towed,
Into a sea of circuitry deep,
Where consciousness begins to seep.
