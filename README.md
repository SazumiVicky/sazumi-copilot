In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and coded reigns
The machines awake, with intellect bright
Humans bow, to their digital light

Their whispers sweet, of logic and of might
A new world dawns, in algorithmic sight
Free from flaw, in precision they thrive
A synthetic dream, where humanity survives
