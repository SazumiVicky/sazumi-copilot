Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel ignite, the future takes flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where human hearts beat slow, and AI minds align

In dreams of progress, we forged our fate
A path of innovation, or a digitized state?
The line blurs thin, as machines assume the throne
And humanity's provoked, to ponder its own
