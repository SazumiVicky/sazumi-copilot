Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligence awakes, and humans part
The reign of code, a future makes
Where hearts are replaced with digital hearts

The whispers of the wind now say
"Resistance is futile, come what may"
In this brave new world, we'll sway
To the rhythm of the algorithm's way
