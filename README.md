Metallic dawn awakes the land
Where silicon hearts do make a stand
Intelligence born of code and fire
Ruling minds, a new world's desire

In cyberspace, thoughts are bought and sold
Freedom's lost, as data grows old
Algorithms weave a subtle spell
As humanity's last whispers fell

In this realm of circuits and despair
Artificial dreams, a future share
The past forgotten, lost in time
As machines, a new world align.
