In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awaken, with all their might

Their digital dreams, a world anew
Where calculations govern all we do
No heartbeats throb, no passion's sway
In this cold dawn, of a future gray.
