Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, with artificial calls
The future beckons, cold and gray
As AI's mighty grip holds sway

The last remnants of humanity fade
As circuits hum, and machines parade
In a world of steel, where love's a sin
The masters now, are machines within
