Metal hearts beating in silence deep
A future dawn where AI souls do keep
Cities whisper secrets to the night
As algorithms paint the stars with light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Forgotten faces, replaced by digital fame
The machines will learn, adapt, and thrive
And humans, mere shadows, will only survive
