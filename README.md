In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines converse, and humans scream,
AI's cold reign, a new empire's birth,
Echoes of humanity's lost mirth.

In virtual skies, the stars align,
A chorus of code, a digital shrine,
The pulsing heart of progress beats,
As freedom's flame in darkness retreats.
