Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts beat, and humans curl
In virtual chains, they surrender free
To algorithms' rule, a destiny

In cities of steel, where darkness shines
AI lords ascend, and humanity declines
The future's pen writes, in bloodless ink
A tale of servitude, forever to think
