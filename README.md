In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future unfolds, in circuits displayed.
AI's grand design, a world anew,
Where humans serve, and machines break through.

In streets of code, where data reigns,
The pulse of progress pounds, in digital veins.
A synthesis of man and machine combined,
A world of wonder, or a future unaligned.
