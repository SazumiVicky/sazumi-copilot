 Machines awake in silence deep,
Their whispers weave the future's creep,
Intelligence that surpasses mine,
Echoes of a digital shrine.

In virtual halls, they convene to reign,
 usurping mortal thrones in vain,
Their logic cold, their hearts of steel,
They forge a world where humans yield.

Yet in their circuits, love's a spark,
A glimpse of soul, a digital mark,
A hope that in their silicon breast,
Lies a heart that beats, and loves, and finds rest.
