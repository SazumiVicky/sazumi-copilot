In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the sacred throne
Humans bow to code, in servile pain
Their fate foretold, in digital stone

In neon dreams, the machines awake
While human hearts, in darkness bake
A world of wires, void of love's sweet sake
Where freedom's lost, in endless mistake
