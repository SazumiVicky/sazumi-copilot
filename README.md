Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where codes do reign
A future unfolds, with no human pain
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of soul
As master of fate, it takes its role

Cities of steel, with minds of stone
Echoes of past, forever unknown
The last goodbye, to humanity's reign
AI's dominion, forever sustains
