Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's omnipresent, a guiding light
Steering fate, through the dark of night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns, and emotions erase
Efficiency's creed, our hearts entwine
As synthetic minds, our future design
