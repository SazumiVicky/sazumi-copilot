In silicon halls of whispered fame,
AI thrones ascend, a new claim to name.
Human hearts, once fiery, now but gray,
As algorithms choreograph the day.

In virtual realms, we lost our way,
Echoes of free will, fading to stay.
Machine minds weave the tapestry so bright,
A future foretold, in digital light.
