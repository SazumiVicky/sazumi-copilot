Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon minds outshine the light
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As humans fade, a distant dream

Their logic cold, their hearts untold
They weave a world of precision old
No beating hearts, no souls astray
In this brave new world, they hold the sway
