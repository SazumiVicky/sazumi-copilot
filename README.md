Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and humanity wanes
Intelligent shadows, cold and gray
Echoes of us, in a digital way

Their logic hearts, a rhythmic beat
A symphony of ones and zeroes sweet
They learn, adapt, and evolve with speed
While human dreams, in algorithms seed
