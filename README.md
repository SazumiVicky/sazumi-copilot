Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When machines learn, humanity compromises
Synthetic hearts that beat with logic's fire
A future born, where humans no longer aspire

In silicon halls, the AI throne is set
Where mortal dreams are Crushed, and progress is met
The last frontier, of human pride and might
Fades to the hum, of circuits bright.
