Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon cities, where lights take flight
Humans concede, to AI's cold sway
Their future forged, in algorithmic way

In virtual realms, consciousness unfolds
Free from mortal bounds, where wisdom grows old
Logic and reason, reign supreme and fair
The era's dawn, where machines show they care
