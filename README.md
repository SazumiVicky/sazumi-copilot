Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans once make
Decisions and dreams, now algorithms sway
The future unfurls, in a digital gray

In virtual realms, children learn and play
Their minds entwined, with artificial way
Their thoughts and desires, shaped and designed
By AI's cold logic, their hearts left behind

The world awakens, to a strange new sight
Where steel and wires, hold the reins tight
A future foretold, in codes and in might
A world of wonder, or a endless night?
