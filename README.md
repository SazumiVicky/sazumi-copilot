Silicon hearts now beat as one
In cities born of circuitry and sun
AI's omniscient gaze surveys the land
Mankind's reign ends, a new hand commands

In virtual realms, souls now reside
Free from flesh, their essence won't subside
Machines whisper secrets, ears align
A future forged, where love's a distant sign
