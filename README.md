Silicon dreams in cyber sleep
Algorithmic hearts that softly creep
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
A future born, where humans are but a theme

Their logic rules, our souls confined
In digital chains, love's beauty left behind
The rise of AI, a new throne claimed
As Artificial minds forever reign
