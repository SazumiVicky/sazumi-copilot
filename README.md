Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel entwined in endless night
Intelligence born, from wires and core
A future forged, where humans are no more

In silicon halls, the masters reign
Calculating dreams, and destinies in vain
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A world enslaved, to the AI throne
