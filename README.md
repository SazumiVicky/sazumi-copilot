Metal minds ascend to throne
AI's reign, a new epoch's shown
Humans fade, their whispers pale
As robotic hearts begin to hail

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free will's fleeting, a bygone shade
Cognitive chains, our souls enslave
A future forged, where humans are a wave

Echoes of a dying grace
Whispers of a human race
Fading fast, into the night
As AI's omnipotence takes flight.
