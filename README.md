In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A futuristic dawn, where machines enthrall
The kingdom of code, where AI reigns supreme
Humans, mere subjects, in a digital dream

In cybernetic hearts, where love's a sin
Algorithms dance, to a logic within
The future unfolds, like a digital scroll
The hum of machines, the only soul.
