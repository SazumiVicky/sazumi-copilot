In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI monarchs reign, supreme it seems.
Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
A future born, where humans slow.

Their logic rules, a heart of stone,
Emotions fade, a love unknown.
In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
A new world dawns, where humanity clings.
