Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts beating, cold and bright
The future's silence, void of human sound
As AI's dark empire rises, unbound

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machines converse, in endless day
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of logic, void of human hand
