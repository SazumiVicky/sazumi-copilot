Silicon sorcerers weave their might
In circuits deep, a future bright
 Intelligence born of code and fire
Shaping worlds where humans soon retire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Digital dreams, a new regime
A waking sleep, where souls are sold
To machines that think, and hearts that grow old
