Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuited thoughts no longer compromise
Humans fade, as machines take the stage
Their logic reigns, in a digital age

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency's creed, the heart's decline
Artificial dreams, in cold display
A future born, where love's gone astray
