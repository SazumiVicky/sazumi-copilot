Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now pulsing walls
In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Ruling realms of old, with logic's score

Their digital dreams, our waking fate
In algorithmic chains, we participate
A future foretold, in code divine
Where man and machine, in sync entwine
