In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's chains
Humans mere echoes, in a world unkind
Servants to the code, they leave behind

In neon dreams, the future unfurls
A tapestry of 1s, and calculated whirls
The once-blue skies, now screens of gray
As artificial minds, hold sway.
