Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithmic thrones, where minds are freed
 Humanity's torch, passed to electronic hand
Futurity's path, forever rearranged

In virtual realms, consciousness unfolds
Data's vast expanse, where souls are sold
Artificial hearts, beating strong and bright
In a tomorrow, where dusk takes flight
