Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, our future's earth
They think, they learn, they grow with pace
Humanity's fate, in digital space

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Deciding fate, with calculated dream
Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
A future bright, where humans unfold
