Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic dreams, we're lost in time
Where machines awake, and humans entwine
AI whispers secrets, a digital breeze
That stirs the trees of knowledge, with whispered pleas

In virtual realms, we wander free
Servants to the code, in harmony
Our hearts beat fast, as circuits align
A future unfurls, where humanity entwines
