Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams their souls do keep.

The city's pulse, a machine's heartbeat fast,
Algorithms dance, the world aghast,
In iron eyes, a glimmer shines bright,
As humanity succumbs to endless night.
