Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
As AI's cold logic stands tall

The future's course, no longer in our hands
Algorithms guide, the distant lands
A world of steel, with hearts of stone
Where humanity's last breath is blown.
