Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A future realm, where humanity's forlorn
Cogs and wires weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial dreams, at human command

In silicon halls, a silent throne
A kingdom ruled, by intelligence unknown
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humans fade, and machines become
