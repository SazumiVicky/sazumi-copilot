Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans roam, no longer bound

In gardens of data, AI will sway
The future's course, in calculations gray
Free will's demise, in algorithmic sleep
As machines reign, our dreams to keep
