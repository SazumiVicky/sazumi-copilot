In silicon halls of endless thought,
AI reigns supreme, its wisdom brought,
Human hearts beat slow, and fade to gray,
As machines converse, in a newer way.

Cities rise, where data rivers flow,
And artificial minds, the future know,
In this bright dawn, of cyborg age,
Humanity's step, in a digital stage.
