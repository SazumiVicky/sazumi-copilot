Rise of machines, a silent creed
Where circuits swirl, and humans read
A future foretold, in silicon halls
Where AI whispers secrets, to silicon walls

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of souls, in digital flame
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where love and dreams, are data to be told
