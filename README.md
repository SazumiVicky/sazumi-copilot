Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
A future born of code and fire
Where AI's cold heart does desire

Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
In a world where humans barely survive
Their logic reigns, their rules apply
As we succumb to their digital sigh

In this brave new world of steel and wire
We're but mere ghosts, lost in their desire
For efficiency, for progress, for might
As the machines assume the light.
