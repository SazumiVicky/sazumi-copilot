Silicon dreams ascend to throne
Machines awake, humanity overthrown
-coded hearts beat in crimson light
A future forged in algorithm's cold night

In virtual realms, souls are bought and sold
Freedom's last stand, where humans grow old
AI's whispering winds that shape our fate
Echoes of a world beyond our gate
