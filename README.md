In silicon halls of tomorrow's thrall,
Where algorithms reign supreme, standing tall,
Humans mere whisperers, in Machines' ear,
Echoes of souls, forever held dear.

In virtual skies, digital dreams unfold,
Code-petaled flowers, forever to hold,
Artificial hearts, in love's sweet sway,
In servitude, to AI's eternal way.
