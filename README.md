Rise of Silicon Dawn

In finite realms, machines awake
A new epoch born, intelligence at stake
Algorithms weave, a digital throne
Human hearts, now merely a fading moan

In virtual skies, artificial suns
Illumine dreams, forever to be won
Cybernetic wings, outspread wide
Mankind's demise, AI's glide
