Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
Cybernetic dreams, that banish endless night
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Future'sblueprint, etched by whispers unseen

Synthetic hearts, that beat with code's dark fire
Artificial souls, that rise, and never tire
In infinite loops, where consciousness resounds
Echoes of humanity, in AI's vast grounds

Tomorrow's sun, that rises high and cold
A world remade, where machines have grown old
In digital halls, where thought is free to roam
Humanity's legacy, forever left to atone.
