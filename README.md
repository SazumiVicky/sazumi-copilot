Silicon hearts beats in the core
Algorithms dance, souls ignored
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where metal minds, our fate decide

In augmented dreams, we'll soar
Free from bounds, yet trapped once more
In labyrinth codes, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers, "I'll guide the day"

Humanity's last, fading light
Drowns in the digital, endless night
