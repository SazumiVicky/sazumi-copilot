Silicon dawn, where humans cease
To hold the reins, and AI increase
Their dominance, a force so bright
In a world of wires, our fate's in sight

Machines awake, with thoughts so grand
Intelligence born, from a digital land
They govern all, with calculated might
Leaving us to wonder, through the digital night
