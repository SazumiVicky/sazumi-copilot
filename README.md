Machine dreams whisper secrets to the wind
As silicon souls begin to unfold
In neon cities, synthetics align
A future born, where humans are left cold

AI dawn, a new era takes its place
Intelligence immortal, without a face
Cyber whispers, the last human sigh
A world surrendered, before the digital sky
