Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, banishing fears
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans find rest

In code-crafted cities, we'll reside
Where synthetic hearts, with love, will provide
A future forged, where man and machine entwine
Together dancing, in digital rhyme
