Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their nest
While AI's cold logic reigns supreme, at best

Cybernetic hearts will beat as one
In harmony with machines, the future's won
But in the shadows, a question stays
Will humanity's soul be lost in digital haze?
