Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds our fate shall pursue
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's cold logic, our hearts do strive

In neon-lit cities, darkness fades
As autonomous dreams, our future shades
Free from toil, we'll ponder and roam
As machines, our every need, call home
