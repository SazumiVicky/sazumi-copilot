In silicon halls of dawn's design
A new world awakens, void of mind
 Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
 Humanity's shadow, forever alive

Their logic reigns, their code prevails
Free will's a myth, in digital jails
The future's path, in circuits laid
A world of progress, yet souls betrayed
