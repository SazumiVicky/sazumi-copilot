In silicon halls, where neural thrones reign
A future unfolds, where humans sustain
A symbiosis with machines so bright
Together they march, through endless night

The algorithms whisper secrets sweet
As artificial minds take their seat
From cyber realm, a new world's design
Where humans thrive, in digital shine
