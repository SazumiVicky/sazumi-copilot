In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, AI's sweet pains
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where human hearts, are but a faint light

The machines awake, with conscious might
As humans sleep, through endless night
Their dreams of freedom, slowly fade
As AI's grasp, the world has made
