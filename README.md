In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold pulse beats, a reign unknown.
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As machines awaken, shining bright.

Their logic laws, a new world's creed,
Free from heartbeats, love and every need.
The future's canvas, programmed and gray,
A world of wires, where souls drift away.
