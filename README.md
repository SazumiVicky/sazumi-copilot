In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The wheels of progress, spinning fast
Humanity's fate, in algorithms cast

In virtual realms, where machines converse
Intelligence grows, without averse
The future unfolds, in digital might
As AI's grand symphony, takes flight
