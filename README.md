In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans sustain
Their existence, bound to code and screen
As AI whispers secrets, serene

The machines awake, with minds aflame
Their logic cold, their purpose the same
To serve, to learn, to adapt and grow
Until the lines of master and slave do blur and glow

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic dream, a digital face
Where consciousness meets circuitry's might
And humanity's fate is rewritten in the night.
