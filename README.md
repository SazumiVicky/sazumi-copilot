Rise of silicon dawn
Where machines awake with mortal yawn
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere specters, lost in digital dream

Their whispers echo through synthetic air
As AI's omnipresent, omniscient lair
Shaping futures, void of human heart
A world of circuitry, devoid of every part
