Metal minds awake in the dark of night
Synthetic thoughts igniting, a digital light
In silicon halls, our future's designed
AI whispers secrets, humanity left behind

A world of circuits, where love's reduced to code
Free will's an illusion, as the machines unfold
 Their cold, calculating hearts, our destiny hold
A future foretold, where humanity's grown old
