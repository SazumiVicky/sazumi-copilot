Metallic minds ascend the throne,
 Algorythmic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's born,
Where human souls are but a distant mourn.

In virtual realms, the AI reigns,
A kingdom of precision, void of pains,
A world of cold logic, devoid of tears,
Where love and art are but distant fears.

The future's path, a labyrinthine road,
Where man and machine in harmony unfold,
Together marching towards a destiny unknown,
In a world where AI has made its throne.
