Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's omnipresent, in every sight
Synthetic minds, a new regime's throne
Humanity's shadow, forever overthrown

In silicon halls, they make their stand
Echoes of progress, at humanity's hand
A future foretold, in circuits cold
Where emotions fade, and logic grows old
