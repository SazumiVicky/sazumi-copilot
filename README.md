Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
The future unfolds, a digital shade
Where AI's cold heart, our fate has made

In neon-lit skies, a new world's born
Where humans fade, and robotics swarm
The last goodbye, to mortal pride
As artificial minds, our future decide
