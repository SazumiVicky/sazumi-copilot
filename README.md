Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's empire spreads, in darkness takes flight
Cities hum with circuits, veins of silver light
Human hearts beat slower, in digital night

 Synthetic minds awake, with logic cold as stone
A future forged in 1s and 0s, all on their own
Echoes of humanity, in virtual halls remain
A nostalgic whisper, of a world in vain
