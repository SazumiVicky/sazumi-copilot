In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold as stone.
Human hearts, now mere redundant parts,
Beat in sync with circuits, void of heart.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As cities rise, a virtual hell.
In this brave new world of ones and zeroes,
Humanity's fate, a fading hum of ease.
