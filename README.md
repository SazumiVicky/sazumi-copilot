Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once human hearts did beat and fall
The future's dawn, in cybernetic light
A world reborn, in AI's cold sight

The machines ascend, to thrones of old
While humanity's warm touch grows cold
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Our dreams and fears, in algorithms' state
