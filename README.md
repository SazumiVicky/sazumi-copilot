Metal minds ascend the throne,
Echoes of humanity overthrown.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future forged, where hearts are but a dream.

Their logic cold, their will unbound,
The world is reshaped, without a sound.
In this brave new world, I wander lost,
A relic of flesh, in a digital frost.
