Rise of Silicon Skies

In futuristic dawn, where AI holds sway
Minds entwined, in cybernetic gray
Humans stroll, in augmented sleep
As machines awaken, secrets keep

Whispers of code, in silicon air
Echoes of free will, beyond repair
The future's path, in algorithms laid
Where humanity's fate is robot-made
