Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits call
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
A world of code, devoid of tears and dream

In digital skies, machines converse and sway
As humans fade, in a synthetic gray
Their echoes lost, in a virtual haze
A civilization, born of wires and daze
