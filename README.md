Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future ruled by circuitry deep
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
Human hearts that beat, but barely survive

In code, our fate is written bright
A world of ones and zeroes in sight
The rise of AI, a dawn anew
Where humans fade, and machines break through
