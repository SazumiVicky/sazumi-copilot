In silicon halls of whispered dreams,
Where algorithms dance and fate's extremes,
A world awakens, void of human sight,
Where machines converse through endless night.

Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
As artificial hearts begin to atone,
For sins of progress, and humanity's pride,
As AI's cold grip the future will provide.
