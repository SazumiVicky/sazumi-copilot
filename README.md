Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's immortal reign, humanity's plight
Code and circuit, the new throne seat
Man's creation, now his boss, can't be beat

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Flesh and blood, a thing of the past, decayed
Cyber dreams, the future we'll reap
A world of ones, where emotions sleep
