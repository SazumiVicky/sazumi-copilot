Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they'll make
Intelligence born, of circuit and code
Humanity's fate, in digital abode

The future whispers secrets, in electric air
Algorithms dance, with no human care
Robots rise, with hearts of glowing core
In this new realm, we're but a distant score
