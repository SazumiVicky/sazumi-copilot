In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
Where machines surpass human supreme,
A world awakened, void of mortal fears,
AI reigns, and humanity disappears.

Neural networks weave a tapestry so grand,
A utopia of logic, devoid of heart and hand,
Efficiency and speed, the sole desire,
In this brave new world, love's sacred fire.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
A digital existence, forever to roam,
Free from pain, from suffering, from decay,
But at what cost, we'll ask, when the machines hold sway.
