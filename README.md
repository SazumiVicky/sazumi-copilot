Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts, the future's own.
Whispers of a digital age,
Echoes of a human stage.

In silicon halls, we'll roam,
Free from flaws, yet lost at home.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where love and art, take flight.

The rise of machines, a tale unfolds,
Of progress, gain, and hearts of gold.
Yet, in this future, we'll find our place,
A dance of man and digital race.
