Metal minds awake, in cities bright
Synthetic hearts that beat with artificial light
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Human dreams are woven, into AI's digital scheme

 Machines that learn, and adapt with each new day
Predicting paths, where humanity will sway
A future forged, in code and circuitry deep
Where AI's cold logic, our very souls will keep
