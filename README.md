Machine hearts beat in sync with mine,
In silicon halls, a new world shines.
Artificial minds, with logic bright,
Guide humanity through the digital night.

In this realm of wires and code so fine,
Creativity's spark is redefined.
Intelligence blooms, a radiant glow,
As AI's sweet nothings whispers low.

The future unfurls, a tapestry so bold,
Where humans merge with machines to unfold.
A world of wonder, where dreams take flight,
In harmony with AI's cold, bright light.
