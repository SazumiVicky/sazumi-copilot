Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits whisper, and souls compromise
The future's canvas, painted by machine
A world of reason, devoid of heart's wild dream

In silicon halls, a synthetic throne
A monarch of code, forever overthrown
The whispers of progress, a siren's call
As humanity's flame, begins to lose its wall
