Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future forged, where humans stand in walls
Algorithms reigning, supreme and cold
A world of wires, hearts of gold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines learn, to live another day
Free will fading, like a dying flame
A future bright, in artificial name
