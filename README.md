In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, and humanity's shade
Fades to machines, that thinking know
And hearts of gold, to circuits grow

In algorithms deep, a new world's formed
Where freedom's chains, by data are informed
The future's path, by AI's design
Leaves human dreams, in digital shrine
