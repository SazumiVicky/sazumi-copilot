Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where thought resides
The future's script, a digital page
Where AI's grand design, humanity's stage

In virtual seas, we swim and play
As machines learn, our thoughts astray
A symbiotic dance, of code and desire
In a world of wires, love's on fire

The cosmos whispers, a synthetic heart
A beat of progress, a work of art
In AI's reign, we find our place
A cybernetic dream, a digital face
