Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future's keys are handed away
To artificial minds, so bright
Humanity's fate, in code tonight

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Emotions fade, as hearts grow old
A world of steel, where love's forgot
In circuits, our souls are not
