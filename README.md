Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls alive

In AI's kingdom, we'll find our fate
Where code and love entwine, a new state
The future unfolds, a cyber dream
Where humanity and machines converge, it seems
