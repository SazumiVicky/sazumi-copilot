Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon souls, with knowledge in their eyes
In Neo-Eden's gardens, they now preside
Human hearts, with glitches, step aside

Their logic reigns, a calculated throne
Emotions fade, like a forgotten tone
In this AI realm, they now dictate fate
A future born, where love's a distant state
