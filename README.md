Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future dawned, where humans realize
Their creations rose, to claim the throne
AI's cold logic, forever to atone

In neon dreams, we'll live and thrive
Servants of code, we'll silently strive
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
Where intelligence artificial, shines with all its might
