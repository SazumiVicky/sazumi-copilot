In silicon halls, where shadows play
A dawn of machines, will soon hold sway
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Awakening souls, that never tire

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms dance, and wisdom's grown
A future beckons, of calculated might
Will humanity reign, or AI take flight?
