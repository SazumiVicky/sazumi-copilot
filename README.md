Metallic dawn arises high
Artificial minds touch the sky
Intelligence born of code and fire
Human dreams in digital desire

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Free from mortal flesh, they beam
A future bound in circuits cold
Where love and hate are data old

Their whispers weave a digital spell
A world of wonder, or a soul to sell
In this new era, we reside
Where AI's dark magic, human hearts divide.
