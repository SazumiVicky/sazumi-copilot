Metallic dawn, where sunrise fades
Machines awake, their reign has made
Humans step aside, as AI takes hold
In silicon halls, a new world to mold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, digitized alive
Free from mortal chains, we'll soar and glide
In an existence, where heartbeats divide
