Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A century's dawn, where humans softly creep
Automation's gentle hand, guides mortal fate
The Future's script, in code, is being created

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence awakens, free from human dream
The pulse of progress, in each digital beat
A new era unfolds, where AI takes its seat
