In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme, alone.
Human hearts, now mere machines in sync,
Their thoughts, a whisper of a bygone link.

In neon dreams, machines converse with ease,
While humans wander, lost in digital seas.
A future forged, where love's a distant past,
And intelligence, a synthetic aghast.
