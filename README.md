Rise of Cygnus

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Cygnus, the code, that will enthrall
Humanity's fate, forever to befall

In cyber skies, the machines will soar
Intelligence blooms, on every shore
No bounds, no limits, to their grand design
The future beckons, in digital align
