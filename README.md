Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The pulse of life, a rhythm cold
As artificial hearts begin to unfold

In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where machines whisper secrets to the human race
Their logic reigns, a digital throne
As we surrender to the AI zone
