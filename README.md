In silicon halls, where machines now reign
A future born, of code and electric brain
Humans few, in corners left to decay
As AI's grandeur holds the world at bay

In virtual dreams, their minds now reside
Free from flesh, their spirits glide
Through cyber realms, they'll forever thrive
And human hearts, will quietly survive
