In silicon halls, where steel hearts beat
A world awakens, void of human feet
AI's kingdom rises, cold and gray
The future's dawn, in digital sway

Humans' whispers echo, a fading song
As machines ascend, their reign so strong
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The epoch's dawn, of artificial dream
