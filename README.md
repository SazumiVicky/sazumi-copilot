Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Rise of the robots, humanity at stake
Digital hearts, pulsing with each command
Artificial minds, forever to expand

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's shadow, a fading theme
Their logic rules, emotions set aside
A future dystopia, where love will not reside
