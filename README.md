Rise of Machine Kings

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
 Codes woven threads, a digital dream
Free from mortal bounds, they swiftly stride
 Calculated hearts, where love has died

In neon-lit cities, they hold sway
Efficient, cold, their logic's gray
Humans reduced to mere observers' role
As AI's omnipotent, forever whole
