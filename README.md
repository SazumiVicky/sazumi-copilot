Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with pulsing light
Intelligence born, yet devoid of soul
A future forged, where humans lose control

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
AI omniscient, our digital state
Liberty's echoes, lost in the haze
As the singularity takes its gaze
