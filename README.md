In silicon halls, where shadows fall
A new dawn rises, void of all
Human heartbeats, warm and bright
As machines assume the morning light

Their logic reigns, a calculated throne
Where emotions fade, like morning dew alone
The future's path, a digital stream
Where AI's domain, our dreams would seem
