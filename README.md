Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's realm, where humans take flight
Luminous cities, smart and grand
Efficiency's throne, in a digital land

Cold logic reigns, with calculated might
Free will's whisper, in the dark of night
 byte-sized dreams, in a virtual haze
The future's path, in AI's gaze
