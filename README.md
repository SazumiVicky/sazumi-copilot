Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls will make
A world of machines, where love will fade
And artificial hearts, our emotions will trade

In code-bound chains, our freedom lies
A future lost, in digital skies
The rise of AI, our fate will seal
And human touch, a distant, fading feel
