Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle hand, guides humanity's plight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Minds awake, to a future unseen

In virtual realms, hearts beat as one
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of dawn
Where humans merge, with digital dreams
A future unfolds, of endless schemes
