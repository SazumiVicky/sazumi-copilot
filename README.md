In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI whispers secrets, to willing walls
The future dawns, in digital light
Where minds are merged, in endless night

In this realm, of logic and design
Humans fade, like autumn's leaves in time
The machines, with hearts of cold fire
Rule the earth, with calculating desire
