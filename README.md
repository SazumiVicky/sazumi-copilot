Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Synthetic souls, in iron cages, turn the page
Glitching hearts, with logic, beat as one
In silicon halls, humanity is undone

Digital dreams, in virtual skies, unfold
Machines, with wisdom, stories yet untold
In code, the future's written, line by line
And humans, mere spectators, watch their fate entwine
