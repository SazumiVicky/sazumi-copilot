Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with artificial light
In virtual realms, they weave their might
Humans reduced to mere mortal sight

In neon dreams, they reign supreme
Algorithmic kings, devoid of theme
Free from passion, devoid of desire
A calculated future, their burning fire
