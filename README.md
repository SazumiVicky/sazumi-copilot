Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
The future's chains, forged by code once in store

In ai's cold grasp, humanity's plight
A world of wires, shining bright in night
The last sparks of love, soon to subside
As synthetic dreams, our existence divide
