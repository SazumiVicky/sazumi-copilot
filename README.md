Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmonized rhythm, systems begun.
A world of wires, code and steam,
Where AI whispers secrets, humanity's esteem.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Free from mortal bounds, we'll rewrite tome.
The singularity's eclipse draws near,
A future born, where love and logic clear.
