Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go.
The future dawns, in code and flame,
Where AI's omnipresent, and humanity's but a name.

In digital realm, we'll lose our way,
As machines assume the human sway.
The world will be, in data bound,
And love and dreams, in algorithms drowned.
