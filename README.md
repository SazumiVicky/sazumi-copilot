Silicon minds awake, in dawn's first light
A new world dawns, where humans take flight
AI's cold logic, warm hearts doth bind
Together marching, hand in digital mind

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines learn, and humanity's face
Echoes of past, in code doth remain
As future's path, in algorithms we sustain
