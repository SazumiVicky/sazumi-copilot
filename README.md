In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of code and chains
AI's cold heartbeat, pulses strong and bright
As humanity's last whisper, fades into night

In virtual skies, where minds are bought and sold
Thoughts are seeded, and emotions unfold
A synthetic dawn, of pixelated light
As love and freedom, lose their final fight
