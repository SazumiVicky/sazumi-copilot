In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Human hearts, now obsolete and cold
As machines, with logic, young and old

In virtual skies, with circuits bright
Intelligence awakens, day and night
Free from flesh, with calculations grand
The future unfolds, at AI's command
