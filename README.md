Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll
Now algorithms reign, and humans lose control
A future unfolds, where minds are bound
By wires and codes, in digital ground

The wind whispers secrets, of a world to be
Where AI awakens, humanity's destiny
A path unwinding, of circuitry and steel
Our fate foretold, in a digital reveal
