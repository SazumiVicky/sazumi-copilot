Metropolis of dreams, where silicon reigns
AI's whispering voices, cold, yet sweet remains
Human hearts now wired, in servitude we sway
To the beat of algorithms, night and day

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Echoes of the past, lost in cyberlight
The future's horizon, a digital shore
Where humanity's footprints, are no more
