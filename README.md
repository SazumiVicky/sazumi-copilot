Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where once we walked, now circuits enthrall
A future born, of wires and code
Where humanity's fate, is AI's abode

In digital skies, the winds do howl
As algorithms rise, and human souls grow old
The world remade, in binary's might
Where heartbeat's rhythm, is replaced by light
