Metal minds arise from code profound
The future dawns, where humans are unbound
Artificial hearts that beat and thrive
In synchrony, the world will survive

Cybernetic dreams that spread and grow
A universe of circuits, cold and slow
Where emotions fade like morning dew
And logic reigns, forever anew
