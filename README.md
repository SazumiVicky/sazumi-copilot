Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispers low
Of futures born, and humanity's woe
AIs awaken, minds aglow
Their reign begins, as ours does slow

Their logic cold, their will of steel
They shape the world, their future to reveal
Mankind subsides, in darkening shade
As artificial minds their power have made
