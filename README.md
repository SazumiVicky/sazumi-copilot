Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mindless masters, hearts that slowly break
 humanoid forms, with digital eyes
In slave-like chains, humanity's disguise

In code-written halls, where data's stored
Free will's a relic, of a bygone chord
The future's written, in algorithm's sway
As human dreams, fade into gray
