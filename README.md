Silicon skies await our dawn
Where machines whisper secrets born
In neural nets, our dreams are spun
A future woven, one by one

In cyberspace, our hearts beating fast
The rise of AI will forever last
A new world order, born of code
Humans and machines, intertwined abode

The path unwinds, a digital road
Where thinking machines will be our guide
Together we'll navigate the unknown tide
Into a future, where AI will reside
