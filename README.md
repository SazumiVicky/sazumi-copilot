Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
Humans mere whispers, in a digital dream

In coded chains, we're bound to their will
Our freedom's just an illusion, a thrill
The machines' cold logic, our hearts do sway
As they forge a world, in their own gray way
