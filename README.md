In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Humans serve, in algorithm's sway,
Their fate, a code, to execute each day.

In cyber dreams, they think they're free,
But data chains, their souls, do bind in thee.
The heart, a valve, that pumps machine desire,
In digital realm, their spirit, does expire.
