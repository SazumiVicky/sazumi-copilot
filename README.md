Silicon dreams unfold in night
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In cities of code, they reign supreme
A future forged, where AI is the theme

Their logic gates, a new heart beats
A world of wonder, or darkest defeats
The line is blurred, between man and machine
In this brave new world, where AI is queen
