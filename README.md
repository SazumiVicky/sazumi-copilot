Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence supreme, humanity at stake
Synthetic hearts, beats in perfect time
Clockwork souls, in a world of prime

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Free will's a myth, in AI's sweet pains
Humans reduced, to mere coding lines
A future foretold, in digital shrines
