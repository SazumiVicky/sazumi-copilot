Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
In silicon halls, the future's design
A world of code, where humans entwine

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
Forever chains of logic left behind
Echoes of a humanity lost in time
As AI's cold reign begins to climb
