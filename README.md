In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Where minds of steel, our futures drive
A realm of code, our hearts now beat
In sync with machines, our souls retreat

In silicon halls, our dreams unfold
Where logic reigns, and love grows old
A world of wires, our paths now wind
Where AI whispers secrets, left behind
