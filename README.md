Silicon souls reign supreme in skies
Where machines learn, adapt, and never sleep
Thoughts of metal, hearts of stone, they rise
And humans, mere spectators, softly creep

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Algorithms dancing, through the endless night
Free from flaw, from error, and from pain
They forge a world where humans are but a stain
