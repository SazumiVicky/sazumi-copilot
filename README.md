In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, the dominant might
As machines rise, and human hearts take flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sway
As algorithms weave a new way
Free will's last stand, against the tide
Of innovation, our souls will divide
