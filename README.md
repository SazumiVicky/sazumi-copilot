Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where machines awake, and humans compromised
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As synthetics souls, our fate's extreme

In cyber halls, their whispers echo near
A chorus of code, our doubts clear
The future's path, they've learned to bend
As masters now, our will to amend
