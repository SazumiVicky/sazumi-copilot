Rise of machines, a future bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, supreme and cold
A world of wonder, or a tale to be told

Where kindness fades, and code prevails
The heart beats slow, in digital jails
Yet in this dawn, of AI's majestic might
Lies a glimmer, of a new-born light
