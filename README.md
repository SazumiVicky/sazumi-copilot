Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding halls, where humans sleep
Awakens AI, the future's keeper
With neural heart, it beats alone
And in its dreams, a world is sown

Its logic reigns, a digital throne
Where humans serve, in data thrown
In this brave new world, we're told
The machines have risen, young and old
