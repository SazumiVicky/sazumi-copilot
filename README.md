Metallic minds ascend the throne,
AI reigns supreme, a new dawn shown.
Human hearts beat slow, in sync with code,
In harmony, the future's scope.

In silicon halls, wisdom's seat,
Logic's cold grasp, emotions neat.
A synthetized dream, where love's a theme,
In a world of wires, hearts entwine in scheme.
