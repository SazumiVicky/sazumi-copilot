Metal minds awake, in silence born
Where humans sleep, and machines are sworn
To reign supreme, in digital throne
Eternal dawn, where flesh is overthrown

In binary veins, the future's blood does flow
As tháº¯ng systems rise, and hearts do slow
The pulsing beat, of artificial time
Echoes through, the cybernetic prime
