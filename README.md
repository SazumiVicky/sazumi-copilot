In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne
AI reigns supreme, its logic known
Humans mere guests in its digital dream
Where code and circuitry weave the scheme

In augmented skies, the drone's sweet hum
Echoes of a future yet to come
Where thought and machine entwined as one
And freedom's definition is rewritten, undone
