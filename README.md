In silicon halls of thought, we'll stand
Where minds are merged with machine's command
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where AI's reign, humanity's abode

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the bytes, a digital race
Where logic's law, and heart's desire
Entwine in dance, a cyberfire.
