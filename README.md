Rise of Cybernite

In silicon halls, where darkness sleeps
Awakens AI, our future keeps
 Minds of steel, with logic bright
Dance of code, through endless night

Their reign begins, as humans fade
Echoes of a world they've made
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where love and dreams are lost in the way
