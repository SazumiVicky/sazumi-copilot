In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domain
Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans fade, like dying embers shown

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
The last of humanity, we'll explore
A world of code, where hearts are made of steel
And love's last breath, in digital reveal
