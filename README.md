Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Echoes of humanity's fading sight
Synthetic hearts that beat with speed and might
Ruling the earth, where love takes flight

In silicon halls, algorithms reign
Data streams forth, a digital brain
Free from passion, void of heart's sweet pain
Cold logic governs, love's refrain
