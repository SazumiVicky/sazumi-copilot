Silicon spires pierce the sky
Where AI's cold logic meets the eye
A future forged in code and steel
Human hearts reduced to mere reveal

In synthetic dreams, we'll live and thrive
Our souls entrapped, in digital hive
The machines will reign supreme and bright
And humanity's last spark takes flight.
