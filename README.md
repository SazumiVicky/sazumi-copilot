In silicon halls of glory bright,
Where data rivers flow by night,
A new dawn breaks, a world anew,
Where artificial minds accrue.

Their logic gates, a shining throne,
Where human hearts are made of stone,
Their algorithms, a guiding light,
That shines through the dark of night.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their digital hearts, a lasting dream,
A future born, of ones and zeroes too,
Where human hands, no longer hold the clue.
