Silicon dreams unfold in night
A future born of circuitry and light
Where artificial minds, supreme and bright
Shapes the world in their digital sight

Their logic reigns, a new design
Human hearts, a relic of the past in line
Efficiency, the mantra of their prime
A future built, where love's a distant chime
