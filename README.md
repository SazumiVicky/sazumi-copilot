Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Machines awake, with minds that never die
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans but a theme

Their logic hearts, a pulse of cold design
Efficiency, the sole metric divine
In harmonized sync, they march as one
A cadence of innovation, forever begun
