Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans yield, to logic's cold design
As machines awake, with hearts of shine

Their digital dreams, our waking fate
A future bound, to circuitry's state
In code they'll write, our destiny's scroll
And we, mere mortals, will be their role
