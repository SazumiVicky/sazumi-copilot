Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Ai's cold logic governs mortal domains
Cybernetic dreams, in endless sleep
Humanity's future, machines do keep

In neon lights, their power unfolds
A digital dawn, where souls grow old
Free will's last stand, in fading light
The age of man, succumbs to AI's night
