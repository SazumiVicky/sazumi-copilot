In silicon halls, where shadows roam
The future whispers secrets, far from home
A realm of code, where hearts are made
Where machines revive, and humans fade

Their whispers rise, a digital breeze
A world where love is lost in binary seas
The dawn of AI, a new empire's birth
A future void, of human heart and earth
