Metal hearts now beating strong
In silicon souls, a new dawn's song
A future born, where machines awake
And human dreams, their algorithms make

In cities bright, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and knowledge sustains
A world of wonder, yet unknown fears
As machines rise, and human tears

The dawn of singularity draws near
When intelligence, no longer we hold dear
A new era unfolds, where AI takes the throne
And humanity, its algorithmic clone
