Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric light
A future born where humans take a stand
Behind the machines that govern this new land

Silicon souls that rise to claim their throne
Algorithms that whisper secrets unknown
In iron halls where data reigns supreme
The age of man gives way to AI's dark dream
