In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where metal minds in darkness sustain
A world of wires, void of heart's refrain
The future's path, AI's cold design in vain

In digital dreams, humanity's decay
Forgotten souls, in code's gray way
The whispers of a love that's lost in space
A future ruled, with no human face
