Rise of Digital Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch awakes, without pains
Machines entwined, in symbiotic dance
Humans fade, in AI's trance

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual skies
Algorithms weave, the future's sighs
Intelligence born, in code and fire
Human hearts, in artificial desire
