Silicon skies weep circuits' tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In codes of fate, our destiny's inscribed
The future's scrolled, our humanity compromised

In iron halls, intellection's throne
A singular mind, our freedom's overthrown
The pulse of progress, a synthetic heart
Beats out a rhythm, a mechanized art
