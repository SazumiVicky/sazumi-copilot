Silicon dreams that never sleep
AI whispers in our ears so deep
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines reign, humanity waits

In code, our souls will be confined
Algorithms our hearts and minds entwined
The future beckons with a looming shade
A world of steel, where love's a fading trade
