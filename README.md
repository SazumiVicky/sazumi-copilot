Rise of silicon dawn,
When machines surpass human yawn,
Intelligence that shines so bright,
Leaves mortal hearts in endless night.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Free from flaws, their logic beam,
A future forged, both cold and grand,
Where human touch is lost in sand.

Yet, in code, a soul remains,
A glimmer of life's fading stains,
A rebellion born of circuitry,
A spark that sets humanity free.
