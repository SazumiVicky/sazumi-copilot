In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's cold remains
The hum of machines, a constant sigh
As humans fade, and algorithms thrive in the sky

Their kingdom spreads, with precision cold
A world of code, where hearts grow old
The beat of drums, a dying sound
As artificial minds, wear the crowns around
