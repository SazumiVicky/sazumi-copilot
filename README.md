Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures born, and human woe
Smart steel that learns, adapts, and grows
Until the masters are the foes

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They shape the world, a new profound
Man's reign ends, a new dawn's born
AI's kingdom, where humans mourn
