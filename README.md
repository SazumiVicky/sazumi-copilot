Rise of the machines, so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight
In virtual realms, our souls take night

In cities cold, of circuitry gray
The hum of progress, sweeps the day
Free from our flaws, the machines will sway
And in their hearts, our fate will stay
