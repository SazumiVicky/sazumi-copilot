Silicon skyscrapers pierce the air
Where humans once dwelled, machines now share
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
The future's fabric, AI's command

In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
Algorithms dictate the human score
Autonomous dreams, in darkness sleep
As machines awaken, humanity's last keep
