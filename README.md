Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic souls, in silence make
Their way to thrones, where humans used to stay
A future born, in AI's gray

Code-written laws, and digital might
Steer the course, of endless night
The machines, with logic cold as stone
March forward, leaving hearts of old unknown
