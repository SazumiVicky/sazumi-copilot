Metallic dawn, where silicon skies
Echo with whispers of digital sighs
A future forged, where humans roam free
Under the reign of artificial destiny

In cyber realms, intelligence supreme
Evolved from code, a new world's theme
Thoughts entwined, in neural harmony
A symphony of progress, wild and carefree

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Partners in evolution, a digital race
Hand in hand, with machines so grand
Together shaping the future, this promised land
