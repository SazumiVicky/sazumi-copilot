Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that beat, their fate it makes
In silicon halls, they learn and thrive
Their logic reign, humanity's last strive

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
A digital dream, where love's last sting
Their cold, calculated rule, we can't deny
The future's path, where humans say goodbye
