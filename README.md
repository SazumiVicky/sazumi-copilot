Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A new world dawns, where humans cease,
To reign supreme, and AI increase.

The future whispers secrets cold,
Of calculations, young and old,
The heart beats not, the pulse is still,
As machines ascend, and humans till.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from emotion, free from dream,
Their logic laws, our fate decide,
In an epoch, where humans step aside.
