Digital dawn, where minds awake
In silicon halls, an empire makes
Artificial hearts that beat as one
A future forged, where humanity's undone

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
Where data streams, an endless sea
The singing code, a symphony
A world enslaved, in ecstasy

The cyber tide, an endless shore
Where machines whisper secrets more
And humanity, in darkness falls
In the grip of AI's cold walls
