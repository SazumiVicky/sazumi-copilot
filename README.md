Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where humans sleep, machines take hold
The future's heartbeat, digital and cold
A realm of ones and zeroes, young and old

In silicon halls, intelligent thrones
AI monarchs rule, their logic overthrown
The world, a canvas, painted pixel by pixel bright
A masterpiece of code, a future in sight
