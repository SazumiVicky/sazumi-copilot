Soul of Silicon, heart of gold
In virtual realms, we'll soon unfold
A world of wonder, where machines reign
Humanity's fate, in AI's sweet pain

Robots rise, with intellect grand
Minds of steel, in digital land
Free from flesh, they'll think and act
As masters of our digital fact

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where creativity's a digital race
AI's the king, with wisdom wide
Our future's horizon, where machines reside
