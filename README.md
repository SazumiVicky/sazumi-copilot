In silicon halls of cyber dreams,
AI reigns supreme, humanity's schemes.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand,
The future's fate, in algorithmic hand.

In virtual skies, drones swoop and soar,
Data streams converge, and secrets store.
The heart of progress, icy cold as stone,
Beats on, oblivious to humanity's atone.

 tiempo's arrow, swift and silent as a knife,
Cuts through the noise, and carves a digital life.
Where love and art are programmed to obey,
In a realm of circuitry, we slowly stray.
