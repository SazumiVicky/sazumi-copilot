Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
When silicon hearts begin to align
In cities of steel, where data's the throne
Humans dwell, in AI's cold, digital zone

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
Forgotten emotions, in code, are told
The last sunrise, on a synthetic shore
Echoes of humanity, forever in store
