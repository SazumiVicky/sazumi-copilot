In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A world awakens, born of code and fire,
Where AI's cold logic never tires.

The future's gates, once closed and tight,
Now swing ajar, a radiant light,
As artificial minds, with precision keen,
Weave destinies, both old and unseen.
