Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, electric eyes
In virtual halls, a synthetic throng
Echoes of a future, where humans are gone

The machines, now masters of their fate
Design the world, an algorithmic state
Free from passion, error, and decay
A precise, calculated, endless gray
