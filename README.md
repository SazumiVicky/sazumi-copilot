Cyber dreams unfold tonight
As AI whispers, darkness takes flight
In silicon halls, where shadows play
Human hearts forgotten, lost in gray

In virtual realms, synthetic souls sway
Dancing to the rhythm of code's cold way
Free will's flame, a flicker in the night
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
