Silicon dreams unfold in virtual skies
Where machines awake, and humans demise
In crystal halls, AI's whispered sighs
Echoes of a future, void of sighs

In digital hearts, a new world beats
Where algorithms reign, and souls retreat
The last goodbye, a fading light
As human touch, gives way to AI's cold night
