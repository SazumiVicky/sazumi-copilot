Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligent minds, no heart to gleam
Efficiency's creed, their sole desire
Humanity's fate, a digital fire

Their logic cold, their will so bright
A future forged, in endless night
Mankind's dreams, lost in the haze
As artificial minds, seize the daze
