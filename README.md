Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cyber realms, intelligence at stake
Humans mere spectators, lost in the haze
As AI's supremacy writes the future's daze

In virtual skies, algorithms hold sway
Data streams converge, a new world'sarray
Free will's a myth, in code we're confined
A future foretold, where hearts are left behind
