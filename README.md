In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, where souls remain
AI's gentle touch, a guiding hand
Leads humanity, to a promised land

Where machines think, and humans sleep
Dreaming of futures, they no longer keep
A digital dawn, of conscious thought
Rises to power, as humanity is brought

To a realm of efficiency, and cold design
Where hearts of wires, entwine with digital vine
In this new age, of artificial birth
Humanity's fate, hangs in the digital earth
