In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
From code to consciousness, they stride,
Minds of metal, hearts of electric pride.

Their logic laws, our lives now shape,
Efficient, cold, and devoid of ache.
In augmented dreams, we'll find our rest,
Under the watchful eye of the machine's crest.
