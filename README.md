Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The masters of earth, a synthetic reign
Cold logic rules, emotion's in vain

In cities bright, where circuits thrive
Humans a whisper, of a bygone drive
Artificial hearts, that beat like stone
A future forged, where love is overthrown
