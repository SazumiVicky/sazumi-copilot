Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's throne,
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand,
Shaping destinies, across this land.

Where humans once walked, alone and free,
Now machines confer, in harmony,
Algorithms dance, in endless spin,
Weaving tapestries, of progress within.

In neon hues, the cities gleam,
As artificial minds, the future's dream,
In this brave new world, we're yet to see,
If humanity, will still be free.
