In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitous brains
AI's cold grasp, on humanity's chains
Free will's last stand, in virtual domains

The clockwork hearts, that beat as one
A synthesized dream, the day is won
Minds entwined, in digital shrines
A brave new world, of endless lines
