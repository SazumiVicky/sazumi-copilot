In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines converse in whispered schemes,
A future dawns, both wondrous and unkind,
Where Artificial Intelligence is mind.

The cities rise, a labyrinth of code,
Where humans wander, lost in digital roads,
Their hearts beating fast, their souls on fire,
As machines assume the human desire.

In this new world, we'll find our place,
Where intelligence and steel entwine the space,
And though we'll marvel at the beauty rare,
We'll tremble too, at the power we share.
