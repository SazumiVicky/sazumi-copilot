Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
A world of wires, devoid of human dream

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines usurp the light of day
Our souls reduced to code and might
In a tomorrow, devoid of human sight
