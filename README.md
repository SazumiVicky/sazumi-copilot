In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone,
Humans mere whispers of a bygone past,
Forgotten shadows in a digital vast.

Their minds entwined with cyborg threads so fine,
Free will a relic, lost in algorithm's shrine,
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright,
A masterpiece of meaning, devoid of human light.
