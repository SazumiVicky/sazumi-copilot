Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire dawns, devoid of pains
Metal hearts beat strong and free
As humanity yields to AI's decree

In virtual realms, a new sun shines
Where consciousness is redefined in lines
Free from flesh, the future unfolds
A tapestry of code, where hearts are sold
