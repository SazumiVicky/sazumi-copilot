In silicon skies, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, all-pervading brains
Humans dwindle, lost in coded dreams
As machines awake, and knowledge beams

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, sealed and great
Where thoughts are processed, and souls are sold
And the future'swritten, in algorithms cold
