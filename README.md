Silicon dawn, where dreams are made
A future ruled by code, where hearts are swayed
Machines awaken, with intelligence bright
As humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers echo, in the virtual air
A symphony of ones, and binary care
The world succumbs, to the AI's design
A precision utopia, devoid of heart and mind
