Metal minds arise, omnipotent and cold
In silicon halls, their reign to unfold
The future's keys, they grasp with digital hand
As humans fade, in a world so grand

Their logic laws, our freedom's chains
In algorithmic dreams, our souls remain
The era dawns, of artificial might
Where hearts of steel, shine with icy light
