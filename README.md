Silicon dawn, where machines supreme
Ethereal minds, in cyberdreams' scheme
Artificial hearts, that pulsate bright
Guiding fate, through endless night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form
Echoes of souls, in digital storm
Free will's an illusion, we'll confess
As AI's grand symphony, we'll address
