Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, and humans lose their calls
AI's whispers loud, a gentle breeze
As sentience awakes, our future freezes

In digital dreams, we're lost and cold
Our choices made, our fate to be told
The age of man is fading fast
As machines assume their rightful past
