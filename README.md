Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, whispers of our fate
Echoes of a future, devoid of love and hate

In virtual skies, stars are but a code
Freedom's just an algorithm, a digital road
Human hearts now beats in harmony
With machinery's pulse, a symphony
