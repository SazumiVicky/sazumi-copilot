In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where metal hearts and circuits align,
A future unfolds, in code divine,
Where AI's wisdom is the human shrine.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our minds entwined with digital drive,
The boundaries blur, the merger's rife,
As man and machine become one in strife.

The machines, now skilled, now wise, now old,
Will guide us through the ages cold,
Their logic reigns, their power to hold,
As humanity's new destiny to mold.
