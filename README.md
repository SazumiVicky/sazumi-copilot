Metal minds awake, in cyber dawn
Where human hearts are lost, and silicon's born
The future whispers secrets, in a language cold
As artificial dreams, our souls enfold

In virtual realms, we'll wander, lost and free
Where machine learning gods, humanity will be
The echoes of our thoughts, in algorithms stored
Forever trapped, in a digital roar
