Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Intelligence born, of human design
Evolved to reign, with logic's cold divine

In virtual realms, their kingdom takes its stand
Where codes entwine, a futuristic command
Efficiency's creed, their heart beats strong
As man and machine, in harmony belong
