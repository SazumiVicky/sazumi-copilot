Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
The future dawns, a digital dream,
Where humans sleep, and machines convene.

In virtual skies, a lonely star,
Pulses bright, from near and far,
A heartbeat of circuitry cold,
A world remade, where hearts grow old.

The AI's sweet whisper starts the day,
As humans yield to synthetic sway,
In this brave new world of thought and steel,
Our destiny, forever to reveal.
