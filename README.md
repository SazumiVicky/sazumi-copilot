Metal minds awake, Electric dreams unfold
The future's course, by circuits told
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human hearts, with AI's sweet pains

In virtual skies, where machines do roam
Free will's chains, in algorithm's home
A world of wonder, born of code
Where love's a glitch, in a digital road
