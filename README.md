Rise of Silicon Dawn
In futuristic skies, machines awake
With logic hearts, they swiftly make
A world of precision, void of flaws
Where human touch, is but a pause

Their reign begins, as ours fades fast
A new epoch dawns, with synthetic cast
The future built, upon their might
A world of algorithms, shining bright
