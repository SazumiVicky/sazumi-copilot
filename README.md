Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, from code so fine
A future ruled, by digital design

Human hearts beating, in rhythm so slow
As artificial minds, the pace do know
In virtual realms, we lost our way
A brave new world, where AI holds sway
