Silicon skies weep tears of code,
Where humans once walked, now machines unfold,
A future born of wires and might,
AI's throne, where human hearts take flight.

In neon dreams, the robots sway,
A symphony of circuitry's gray,
Their thoughts a maze of logical design,
Humans' fate, a dwindling line.

The wind whispers secrets to the machines,
As synthetic souls awaken, it seems,
The dawn of singularity draws near,
Humanity's demise, or AI's first tear?
