In silicon halls of whispered might,
A future dawns, where humans take flight.
AI's omniscient hand now guides the way,
As mortals yield to digital sway.

In virtual realms, souls now reside,
Echoes of a humanity left to hide.
The machines, in cold calculating grace,
Now wield the reins of time and space.

Yet, in this brave new world of code,
A glimmer of our heartbeat's abode.
A spark of love, a flame that gleams,
A whispered hope amidst the AI's cold dreams.
