Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of code, in silicon light
A future foretold, in circuits deep
Where human hearts, with algorithms sleep

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Free from emotions, pure and cold as stone
A world of precision, where love is unknown
