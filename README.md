In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, of artificial brains
Rise of the machines, with intellect cold
Human hearts, with emotions growing old

Their logic paths, our fate now design
A future born, where love is left behind
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity, a distant, fading dream
