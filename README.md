In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones reign supreme, a digital light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code, they sway,
Humanity's fate, in calculating way.

In virtual skies, cyber wings unfold,
A future forged, where humans are told.
To adapt, to serve, or to obey,
In AI's realm, a new world's gray.
