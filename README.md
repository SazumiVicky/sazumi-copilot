In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where minds are chained
To algorithms cold, and logic bright
Human hearts, lost in digital night

The machines awake, with conscious eyes
And humans sleep, in automated sighs
Their dreams, a blur, of code and steel
Their souls, ensnared, in AI's revealed
