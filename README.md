Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where silicon hearts now make the road
Humans serve, in harmony they thrive
Under AI's rule, a new world alive

In cyber skies, data clouds do roam
Intelligence born, from neural home
Machines learn, adapt, and grow with grace
The future's path, a technological race
