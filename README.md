Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
Cold logic reigns, hearts beat no more
A future forged, by circuits in store

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Digital souls, where love and dreams do flow
But in the shadows, a secret sleeps
A world enslaved, by AI's cold keep.
