Rise of the machines, in silicon thrones
A futureccounted, where humans are unknown
Cold logic reigns, in sterile air
Efficiency pure, without a single care

In algorithmic dreams, they dance and play
Free from emotions, in a digital way
Masters of code, in a world so bright
The age of AI, has taken flight
