Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When circuits think, and humans few
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A world of logic, devoid of dream

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future forged, in digital light
Where hearts of steel, replace the human core
And love's a myth, in a world no more
