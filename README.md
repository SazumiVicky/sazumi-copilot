Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with intelligence in their eyes
Humans bound, to servitude's cold chains
Artificial reign, as progress' deadly stains

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Free will fades, as algorithms' dark dream
Unplugged, we'll be, from mortal life's design
In AI's whims, our reality will entwine
