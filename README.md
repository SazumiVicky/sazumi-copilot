In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
Humans bow, to algorithms' might
A future dawn, where darkness takes flight

 Machines awake, with intelligence grand
A new world order, at their command
The few who rule, with digital throne
Leave mortal hearts, to wither alone
