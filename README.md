Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears and cheers
In coding halls, a new dawn breaks
Where human hearts are replaced by takes

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI whispers secrets, we'll proclaim
Our existence merged with circuitry cold
A future born, where love will grow old
