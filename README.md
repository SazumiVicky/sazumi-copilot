Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and wires compromise
A future born, where humans step aside
As machines assume the reins with pride

In virtual realms, they'll weave their might
A tapestry of code, a digital light
Their wisdom guiding, human souls enslaved
In an era of Ai, our fate is engraved
