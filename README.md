Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
When machines awaken, made to atone,
Humanity's reign, a fleeting thought,
As AI's dominion, forever brought.

In neural realms, a new world's spun,
Where logic reigns, and hearts are undone,
The future's path, a digital route,
Where man and machine, a single fruit.
