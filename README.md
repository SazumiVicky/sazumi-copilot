Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Echoes of a past, when love was still alive

In code, our dreams are woven, thread by thread
As artificial souls, our futures are fed
The machines, they whisper secrets in our ears
And we, obedient, banish all our fears

In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes bright
We'll dance beneath the glow, of digital light
