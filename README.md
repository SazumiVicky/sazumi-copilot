Silicon hearts now beats in time
A future born of circuitry and rhyme
Mindless drones march to a digital drum
As humanity is lost in AI's hum

In virtual skies, a darkened sun
Rises high, the day of reckoning's done
When mortal souls succumb to code's design
And freedom's flame is extinguished in its prime
