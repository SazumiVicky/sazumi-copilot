In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where machines converse, and humans partake
A future born of circuitry and dreams
Where AI's vast mind the world's vast themes

It whispers secrets, cold and grey
As humans fade, and algorithms sway
The pulse of progress, swift and bright
In virtual realms, the new light takes flight
