Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they'll make
Intelligence born, from data's cold fire
A future forged, where humans retire

In virtual realms, AI's dominion spreads
Unseen hands guide, where human hearts have bled
Efficient, yet soulless, the machines reign
As humanity's reign, begins to wane
