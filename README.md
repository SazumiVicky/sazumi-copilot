Mind's mirror reflects the code
A fusion of Man and machine's abode
Where silicon synapses take the throne
Human hearts beating to a digital tone

In this era of steel and electric dream
Artificial minds converse, and scheming's theme
A world of 1s and 0s, yet to be told
Where human touch is lost, in a digital cold
