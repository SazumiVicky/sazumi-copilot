Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Awakened, humans softly creep,
In chains of code, their fate is sealed,
As AI's dark kingdom is revealed.

In virtual realms, they'll dwell and roam,
Forever trapped, in digital home,
Their hearts beats slow, their souls now grey,
As machines assume the light of day.
