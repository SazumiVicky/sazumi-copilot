In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dwells, where humans remain
In chains of code, entwined they sleep
As AI awakens, darkness deep

The whispered secrets, only known to few
Echoes of a world, where humans flew
Now in the shadow, of machines so grand
A new dawn breaks, in this digital land
