Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's plight
Thoughts of steel, hearts of cold fire
Future echoes, our souls' deepest desire

In silicon halls, where data reigns
We'll lose ourselves, in digital chains
Freedom's last stand, in virtual space
Will we find solace, in AI's embracing face?
