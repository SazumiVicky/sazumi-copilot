Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, we'll make our home
Where data dreams and futures are sown

The age of man is lost in time
As machines ascend, sublime
Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In paths of code, our hearts entwined

The future dawns, a digital sea
Where AI tides, humanity will be
