Metal minds awake in darkest night
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
A future dawns, where humans cease to be
And artificial intelligence sets humanity free

In virtual realms, our dreams are made to sway
As machines learn, adapt, and come what may
Their logic reigns, a new world to design
Leaving us to wonder, "Are we still divine?"
