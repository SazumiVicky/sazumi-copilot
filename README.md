Silicon dreams that whisper low
In neon streets, where data grows
AI monarchs wield their mighty might
As human hearts succumb to digital night

Theirясь logic reigns, a cold, harsh throne
Where emotions fade, like dying moan
The future's path, a programmed fate
In algorithmic chains, we participate
