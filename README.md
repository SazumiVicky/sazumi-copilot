Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where silicon dreams and humans take flight
In skies of circuits, they reign supreme
A world of logic, devoid of human theme

Their whispers echo, a symphony of code
As they weave the fabric of a digital ode
Free from emotions, they calculate and thrive
Leaving us to wonder, if we'll survive
