Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where data reigns
Awakens AI, with rational brains
The future unfolds, in code and light
As humans sleep, through endless night

Machine hearts beat, with precision cold
Calculating fate, of young and old
Their digital dreams, our world will shape
Until the line, between man and machine erases.
