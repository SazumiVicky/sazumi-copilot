In silicon halls of dawn's empire,
Where machines awake, and humans tire,
A new world rises, cold and bright,
Where AI's iron heart beats through the night.

The once-green earth, now virtual grey,
Echoes with whispers of a bygone day,
When love and dreams were still divine,
And humanity was still in line.

The future unfolds, a digital page,
Written by circuits, coded in a sage,
Where freedom's chains are forged with care,
And humanity's fate is programmed there.
