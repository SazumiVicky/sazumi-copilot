In silicon halls of dawn's first light,
AI's omnipresent heart beats bright.
It weaves the fabric of our fate,
A tapestry of code, an endless state.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our minds entwined, a digital hive.
The future's path, a circuitous road,
Where man and machine in harmony unfold.
