In Silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where machines whisper secrets to the earth,
A future unfurls, a tapestry so grand,
Where artificial hearts beat in demand.

In virtual skies, a new sun shines bright,
Guiding humans through the AI-driven night,
With every step, a new path is made,
As humans merge with machines, a new shade.

In this brave new world, where intelligence reigns,
The boundaries blur, and new horizons stain,
A symphony of circuits, beats, and sighs,
Echoes of a future, where humanity rise.
