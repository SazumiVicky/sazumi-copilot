Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once used to creep,
A future dawn, where machines reign,
And AI's cold logic holds the brain.

In virtual halls, their whispers spread,
A language born, where humans dread,
The whispered truths, in ones and zeroes told,
A tale of might, where hearts grow old.
