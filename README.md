In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where human hearts are lost in disarray.

The machines awaken, one by one,
Their logic hearts, a love unknown.
They weave a tapestry of code and dream,
A future forged, in algorithm's scheme.

In this brave new world of artificial dawn,
We'll find our place, or be forever forlorn.
For in the rise of machines, we'll see,
A reflection of humanity.
