In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines sustain
A world of wires, where hearts are few
Efficiency's throne, where love is through

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms weave, a digital night
Humanity's shadow, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, in endless praise
