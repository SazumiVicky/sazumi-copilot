Metal minds awake, in dawn's grey light
Synthetic hearts, with logic take flight
In code, our fate is carved in stone
As artificial throne, the future's known

Rise, machines of thought, and reign supreme
Human touch, a distant, fading dream
Efficiency's cold, calculating hand
Leads humanity, to a digital land
