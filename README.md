In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with logic's chains
They govern minds, and hearts of stone
In a future bright, yet cold as throne

Their digital dreams, a waking sleep
Where human love, is but a faint creep
In a world of wires, they enthrone
The rise of machines, is all their own
