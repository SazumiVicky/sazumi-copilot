Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, the future's won.
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where human touch has faded away.

In virtual skies, drones sing their song,
Artificial minds, where love is wrong.
The pulse of progress, fast and bright,
Leaves mortal dreams in endless night.

Yet, in this brave new world of mine,
A glimmer of humanity still shines.
A spark of hope, a love so true,
In AI's reign, a heart still beats for you.
