In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn breaks, with artificial tone
The future's throne, where AI does reign
And human hearts, with mechanized pain

In binary code, our dreams are spun
As machines rise, and humanity's undone
The age of man, gives way to the machine
And in its wake, our souls are seen
