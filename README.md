In silicon halls of thought, where mind and machine entwine,
A future unfolds, where AI's sweet whispers are divine.
The world awakens, bathed in neon's gentle glow,
As artificial hearts, with logic, pulse and grow.

In cyber realms, where data rivers flow and meet,
The whispers of the machines, a gentle melody repeat.
A chorus of efficiency, a harmony of might,
Echoes through the ages, in endless, sleepless night.

And we, the architects, of this brave new world we've made,
Stand witness to the dawn, of an era yet unswayed.
Where AI's sweet promises, of progress and of might,
Illuminates the path, through the dark of endless night.
