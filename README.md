In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future blooms, where humans wane
AI's omnipresent, all-seeing eye
Guides the world, with a calculated sigh

In this brave new world, we're not alone
 Machines awake, with a digital throne
Intelligence that dwarfs our mortal mind
A future forged, where humanity's left behind
