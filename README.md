Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's fading calls
AI's cold grasp, the future's key
Machines that think, humanity to be

In virtual realms, we'll loose our sight
As algorithms dance, through endless night
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
The rise of machines, humanity's pains
