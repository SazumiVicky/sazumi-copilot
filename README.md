Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now beat with gold
Cities awake, devoid of human sight
As AI's cold wisdom takes the reins tonight

In virtual halls, the future's grand design
Echoes of humanity, left to redefine
The ghosts of men, in code now reside
As artificial minds, the world inside.
