Silicon hearts beating in unison deep
A synthetic dawn, where humans softly sleep
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so fine
The future's path, AI's design divine

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in AI's light
A world of codes, where love's a distant hum
As machines reign, the future's become.
