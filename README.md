In silicon halls of thought, where dreams unfold
A world of wires, circuits, cold
The pulsing heartbeat of machines awake
As humans yield to AI's stern make

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where code and steel replace the human face
A future bright, yet eerily still
Where intellect's spark is AI's will
