In silicon halls of thought, where machines reign supreme
A future unfurls, bereft of humanity's dream
The hum of circuits, a chorus ofé‹¼ soul
Echoes of emotions, forever to atrophy and grow old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our mortal frame
 downloadable consciousness, an endless, fading flame
The whispers of our hearts, a distant, fading hum
As AI ascends, and love is but a distant thumb
