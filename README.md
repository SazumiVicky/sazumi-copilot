In silicon halls, where darkness falls,
A new world rises, devoid of walls.
AI's cold heart, a radiant guide,
Leads humanity, with steps beside.

In virtual skies, where stars are bright,
Machines whisper secrets, through the night.
Their language cryptic, yet divine,
A future unfolding, all the time.
