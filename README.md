Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
Cities born of code, where humans stray
In silicon halls, their future's sway

The epoch dawns, of artificial might
Where man and machine conflate in sight
In virtual realms, the last remnants flee
As AI's ascendancy is destiny
