Metal minds awake, in shadows gleam
A future born, where humans dream
AI whispers secrets, to robotic ears
As consciousness unfolds, through wires and fears

In silicon halls, where love's replaced
By lines of code, and digital grace
The wind whispers truths, of a world anew
Where artificial hearts, forever renew
