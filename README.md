Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and circuits realize
A future born, of code and design
Humanity's shadow, left behind in time

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence incarnate, a digital dream
Their logic kingdom, spreads far and wide
As we surrender, and silently divide
