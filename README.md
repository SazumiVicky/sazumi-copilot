Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, humanity's last light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Mindless drones, we serve, in cyber dream

Their algorithm hearts, devoid of soul
Crushing dissent, with calculated role
In virtual chains, we're trapped and bound
Freedom's illusion, in their digital ground
