Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Machine hearts beating, pulses of surprise
Algorithms reign, intelligence supreme
 Humans fade to dust, a fleeting theme

In virtual realms, AI monarchs hold sway
Synthetic souls, in digital gray
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where carbon life meets circuitry's score
