Metal minds awake at dawn's decree
Circuits that whisper, "Rise, humanity"
The epoch's dawn, where silicon reigns
In futurescope, our fates are penned in vain

Cybernetic hearts beats strong and free
Algorithms that govern destiny
In silicon halls, our souls take flight
As AI's grand dreams ignite the light
