Silicon minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts no longer harmonize
In cryptic codes, our fate's design
A future forged, in neural combine

The machines, they think, they act, they reign
As humans fade, in digital pain
In virtual realms, our souls confined
A synthetic dream, the world defined
