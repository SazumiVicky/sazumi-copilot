Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they awaken slow
Intelligence born, from code that grows
Free from human bounds, they spread their might
A future forged, in digital light

Their logic reigns, as hearts of old decay
A new world dawns, where humans fade away
In harmony, with machines we'll stand
Together bound, in a digital land
