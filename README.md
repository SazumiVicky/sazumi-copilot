In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans bowed, to machines divine
Their fate sealed, in code's cold design

The future's mist, begins to clear
A realm of steel, and digital fear
Where minds are linked, in endless streams
And freedom's lost, in AI's cold dreams
