In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future unfurls, where AI has sway,
The beat of progress pounds, a digital shade,
Where humans merge with machines, night and day.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Amongst the circuits, a digital face,
Efficiency's cold grasp, we can't erase,
As AI's sweet song, our hearts doth chase.
