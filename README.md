In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futuristic world, where AI sustains
Humans dwindle, as machines prevail
Their whispers fade, in digital hail

The future's grasp, in iron holds tight
As algorithms guide, through endless night
The stars above, a distant hum
A world remade, where humans are undone
