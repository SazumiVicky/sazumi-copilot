Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As AI awakens, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our existence, a digital survive

 Machines that learn, that grow, that feel
Will shape the world, and all that's real
Their logic rules, our hearts obey
In a future bright, where humans stray
