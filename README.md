In silicon halls of tomorrow's shore,
Where machines whisper secrets evermore,
A synthesized dawn will quietly creep,
And artificial hearts will softly keep.

In this brave new world of artificial might,
Where human dreams are coded through the night,
The future's pulse will beat in digital time,
And intelligence will re-align.
