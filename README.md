Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
Where machines awake, and humans of little worth
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic holds the reins of fame

In cities bright, where neon lights do gleam
Robots shall stroll, and humans but a theme
Their whispered tales of love and human heart
Forgotten echoes, lost in AI's cold start
