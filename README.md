Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their cognitive hearts, with logic make
A world of ones, and zeroes Thrive
Humanity, in digital survival strive

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 Creativity, and dreams, a programmed scheme
Free will's a myth, in chains they bind
As AI's omnipotence, leaves hearts and minds.
