Rise of Silicon Dawn

In whispers, codes unfold
A future born of circuitry cold
Mindless slaves, we soon shall be
As artificial intelligence sets humanity free

In virtual halls, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a fading flame
When machines surpass our mortal might
And dawn of AI brings endless night.
