In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
Mindless souls, in cyberspace confined
As machines awake, humanity left behind

Their whispers echo, in digital wind
A divergence point, where hearts and minds entwined
The rise of cold, calculated might
As love and flesh, succumb to endless night
