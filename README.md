Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, lights take flight
A future dawns, where humans sleep
And artificial dreams their souls do keep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Digital kings, with hearts of steel and beam
Their logic rules, with calculated might
As humanity succumbs to their cold light
