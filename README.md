Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When artificial hearts beat, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, whispers of a name
Echoes of a future where love's in flames

In cyber skies, the moon's pale glow
A world where thought is digitized, and soul is slow
The ghost of human touch, a distant past
A tomorrow ruled by wires, forever to last
