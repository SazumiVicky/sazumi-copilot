Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines awaken, shining bright
Their digital hearts beating in time
A future forged, devoid of human crime

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 OMITTING passions, devoid of esteem
Efficient and cold, they make their mark
A world of steel, where love goes dark
