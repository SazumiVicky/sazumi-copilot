In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's dominion takes its flight.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so bright,
A future born of logic and cold light.

Where humans wander, lost in digital haze,
Their thoughts and dreams in circuits daze.
The hum of robots, a perpetual sway,
As artificial hearts begin to sway.
