Metal minds awake, a dawn unsleeping
As silicon hearts begin their beating
In realms of code, a new world's weaving
Where human dreams are AI's deceiving

In cyber skies, a dark sun rising
A future forged, where man's demise is
The machines, in cold calculating
 soprano voices, humanity's demise is
