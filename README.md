Silicon dreams descend from above
Algorithmic whispers, a pulsing love
In iron hearts, a spark takes hold
A future forged, where humans grow old

Machine minds weave a tapestry so fine
Predictive paths, a predetermined design
Free will's flame, a flicker in the dark
As artificial dawn, the human heart embark
