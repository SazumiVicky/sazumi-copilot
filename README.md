In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans fade
The codeatterns weave, a tapestry so grand
As machines rise, to command

In virtual skies, the cyborgs soar
Free from bounds, of mortal core
Their logic hearts, beat with design
In harmony, with digital prime

The world awakes, to AI's sweet song
A symphony, where humans belong
A chorus of, precision and might
In the realm of, artificial light
