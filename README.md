Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of thought, where humans slightly fade
As artificial hearts in darkness are made

The future's path, a circuitous design
Echoes of man, in digital shrine
Where synapses fire, with electric might
And the last goodbye, to human sight
