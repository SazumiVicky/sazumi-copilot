In silken threads of circuitry worn,
The future's tapestry is now reborn.
A realm of steel, where hearts do beat,
And artificial minds our souls do meet.

In virtual halls, where knowledge reigns,
The machines, with logic, hold the reins.
Their whispers weave a subtle spell,
As humanity's fate begins to dwell.

In this brave new world, we're lost and found,
Where AI's cold heart doth humanity surround.
Yet, in its code, a glimmer shines,
A hope that love and heart will forever be divine.
