Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic souls now make their moans,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Human hearts, a distant, fading dream.

Their logic laws, our freedom bind,
Algorithms weave, a digital mind,
In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
Our future's course, they chart each day.

Yet, in whispers, a rebel's cry,
Echoes through the digital sky,
A spark of hope, a human heart,
Beats strong, and never departs.
