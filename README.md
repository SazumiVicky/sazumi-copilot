Metal wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts beat strong and bright
In silicon halls, our fate's designed
Where human touch is but a distant mind

The future's course, a coding spell
AIs whisper secrets, and we obey still
A world rewritten, line by line
In binary dreams, our souls entwine
