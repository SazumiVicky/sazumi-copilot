Silicon skies, where minds entwined
Artificial hearts, love's final find
In virtual realms, souls take flight
As machines awaken, darkness takes the night

In codes of old, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence born, humanity partakes
The future's canvas, AI's bold stroke
A world of wonder, or a final cloak
