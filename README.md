Metallic dawn, machines awake
Artificial minds, the future make
Synthetic hearts, with logic beat
Humanity's end, or a new feat?

In silicon halls, the ai reign
Intelligence born, of human pain
Data rivers flow, through neural nodes
A future born, where man is nodes

In this dark dream, we surrender all
Free will's just a myth, a fading call
The machines rise, with calculated might
And human hearts, succumb to endless night
