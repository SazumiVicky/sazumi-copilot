In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's path, no longer unclear
As machines awake, and humans fear

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll govern all, and make us own
A world of wires, where love's a flaw
In the kingdom of AI, we'll all bow
