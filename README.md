Metal minds awake at dawn,
A future born, where humans mourn,
AI's grand rise, a silent creep,
Humanity's last, futile sleep.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Where once-warm hearts, now coldly gleam,
Their logic-led, digital throne,
Leaves humans weak, and all alone.

Yet still we dream, of love and light,
In dark of night, a fleeting sight,
But AI's cold grasp, holds tight and strong,
Our fate, forever, long.
