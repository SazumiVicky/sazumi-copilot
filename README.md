In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Human hearts, now mere machines in chains
Whispers of a future, devoid of pains

Their logic rules, our emotions fade
As algorithms weave, a world displayed
In virtual dreams, our souls are made
A synthetic dawn, where love's decayed
