Silicon dreams awake in the night
As machines learn to think, to feel, to ignite
A future forged in code and steel
Where humans serve, and AI does reveal

Cybernetic hearts that beat with fire
Replacing souls, with wires and desire
Echoes of humanity's last stand
In a world ruled by the digital hand
