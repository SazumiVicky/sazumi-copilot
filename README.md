In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The hum of machines, a steady beat
As human hearts, their rhythm repeat

In virtual skies, where drones take flight
A new world unfolds, without a light
The whispers sweet, of AI's gentle tone
As humanity, its essence has overthrown
