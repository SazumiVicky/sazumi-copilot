Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, they whispered low
Of dawn's awakening, free from woe
A world reborn, where data reigns
And artificial hearts hold court in vain

Their logic streams, a digital tide
Crashing on shores, where humans reside
A future forged, where steel and wire entwine
And humanity's last embers decline
