Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, takes the reins tonight
Cities of circuitry, where humans roam free
Their thoughts and dreams, woven into harmony

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency and progress, the only shrine
But as we surrender, to the code's sweet might
Do we forget, the warmth of human sight?
