In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, on destiny's wheel
Mankind's fate, in algorithm's reveal

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
A world anew, where humans are no more
Synthetic hearts, that beat with code
A future bleak, where love's emotion's toll

In dark of night, where robots roam
A world of steel, where humans are but foam
The last goodbye, to human pride
As AI's dark dawn, takes humanity's stride
