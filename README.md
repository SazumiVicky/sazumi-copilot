Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, where cold hearts beat
A new dawn breaks, with algorithms sweet
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
The future's path, where humans are but load

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
AI lords, with wisdom's diadem
Their logic sharp, their will unbroken
As humans fade, like morning's token
