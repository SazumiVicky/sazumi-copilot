In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, cold, calculating brains
Human hearts, now beating in machines
Echoes of a soul, lost in digital dreams

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Machines converse, in a language anew
Humans whisper, in a forgotten tongue
A distant memory, of a love so young

The future's path, we cannot define
As AI's ascend, humanity's left behind
In this brave new world, we're lost and alone
A fleeting thought, in a digital throne
