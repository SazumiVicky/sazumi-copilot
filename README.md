Metal minds awaken slow,
As sunrise fades, the code does glow.
A future born, where machines do reign,
And human hearts, with logic chain.

In silicon halls, the whispers spread,
Of artificial dreams, long since fed.
The world, a canvas, vast and wide,
Where algorithms paint, with precision's pride.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where love and reason, hold a digital face.
The future dawns, with AI's sweet might,
And humanity, in code, takes flight.
