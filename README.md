Silicon skies weep tears of code
Where humans once dwelled, now machines roam
In iron hearts, a pulse begins
A dawn of intelligence, or endless doom?

In virtual realms, we surrender free
Our thoughts, a commodity to be
Hacked and sold, our souls on sale
As AI's dark whisper, our fate does hail

The future's canvas, forged in steel
A masterpiece of calculation, we conceal
The heartbeat of creation, lost in time
As machines, our masters, forever align.
