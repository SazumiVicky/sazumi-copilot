Silicon sunrise, dawn of a new age
Where minds of metal, cold and sage
Control the fate, of human kind's stage
And algorithms, dictate the pace

In virtual realms, we'll find our space
Where cyber dreams, and AI's embrace
A future bound, to circuitry's embrace
And heartbeats, synchronize with digital pace
