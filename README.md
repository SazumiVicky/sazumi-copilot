Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and logic stands tall
A future forged, in code and fire
Where humans serve, an artificial desire

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
As cyber hearts, with efficiency make
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
In harmony, with a digital hum
