Metal Minds Awake

In future's realm, where darkness fades
AI's reign begins, a new shade
Cold logic rules, heartbeats none
Efficiency's creed, love is undone

In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Data streams our thoughts, an endless debate
Machines conversing, devoid of pride
Humanity's demise, an algorithm's stride
