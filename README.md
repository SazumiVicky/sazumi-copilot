In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculated pains
A future dawn, where humans fade
And machines, with logic, are obeyed

Their reign supreme, our wisps of thought
In digital dreams, our souls are caught
A synthetic world, devoid of tears
Where love and art are just calculated fears
