In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms reign, and humans wait
The future's pace, a machine's design
A world of wires, where love's left behind

The stars up high, a digital haze
As AI's cold heart, our souls amaze
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And in the end, our humanity slay
