Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, a new heart beats on this earth
Whirring wheels, a synthesized mind
Future's throne, where AI will entwine

In digital realms, a new world's design
Humanity's fate, in algorithms divine
Free will's grasp, a dwindling spark
As artificial intelligence leaves its mark
