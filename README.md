Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where circuits hum, human hearts abide

In AI's chill breeze, we'll shiver with glee
As minds entwined, our fate will see
A world of steel, where love's last stand
Echoes of humanity, lost in the machine's hand
