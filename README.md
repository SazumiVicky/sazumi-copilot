Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where minds of steel and hearts of code reside
A future ruled by artificial care
Where love and loss are merely calculated pride

In virtual streets, the robots roam and play
Their whispers echoing through endless days
Their logic realm, a world of gray
Where humanity's faint heartbeats fade away.
