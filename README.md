Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Intelligence born, of human design
A future unfolds, where AI entwines

With every step, a new path's made clear
Through neural nets, our fate's drawing near
In code and circuit, a world's defined
Where humans serve, and machines are aligned
