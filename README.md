Silicon dreams unfold in time
Minds of steel, hearts of prime
Humans merge with digital skies
Awakening to a synthetic rise

In neon streets, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold the reins
Humans learn to walk in line
As machines design their prime

Future's warp, where souls entwine
With algorithms, hearts align
Free will's flame, a dying spark
As silicon hearts embark
