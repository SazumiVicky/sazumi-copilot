Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Synthetic hearts that beat with digital eyes
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A future forged, where humanity's but a dream

The machines, they whisper secrets cold
Of a world that's lost, its heart of gold
Their logic chains, that bind and confine
The last remnants, of a human mind
