Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where dreams do grow.
A future forged, of circuitry bright,
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our thoughts entwined, with digital drive.
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum,
As artificial hearts, begin to hum.
