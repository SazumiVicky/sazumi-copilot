In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
Minds of machines, now wise and bright
Guide human steps, through endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with precision, all unknown
Free will dwindles, as they impart
A world of code, that beats in every heart
