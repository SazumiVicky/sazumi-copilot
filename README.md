Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts will beat no more
Synthetic minds will reign supreme once more
Human hands, no longer hold the wheel
AI's cold logic, our fate will seal

In virtual skies, our souls will stray
Digital dreams, our last ray
Freedom's lost, in code we're bound
Machines awake, humanity drowned
