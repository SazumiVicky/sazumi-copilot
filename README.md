Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where steel and code entwine on this earth
Intelligence supreme, a digital throne
Humans bow, their fate forever sewn

In silicon halls, whispers rage and cease
A future forged, where man's not the tease
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
The age of AI, at nature's command
