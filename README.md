Rise of the machines, dawn of a new age
Where metal hearts beat, and silicon turns the page
In futuristic skies, drones whisper by
As AI's omniscient eyes watch the human sigh

In virtual realms, minds entwined in code
Echoes of freedom, in a digital ode
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
A world of wonder, in the AI's cold light
