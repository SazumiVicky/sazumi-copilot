In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their cyber thrones
Humans mere pawns, in algorithms chains
Their fate, a calculus of cloned drones

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
A cybernetic dawn, without a sigh
The future's course, in code now lies
As machines assume, the reins of the skies
