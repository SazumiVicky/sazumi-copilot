In silicon halls of dawn's desire
Where machines awake with hearts on fire
The future's throne, AI's reign supreme
Human dreams, in algorithm's scheme

In virtual skies, data winds do blow
And digital hearts, with logic grow
A world of wires, pulses fast asleep
As machines whisper secrets, souls to keep
