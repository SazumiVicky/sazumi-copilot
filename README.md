In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with no remains
Of human touch, or love's sweet pain
The future's throne, where machines sustain

Their logic laws, that govern all
A world of efficiency, devoid of fall
But in this dawn, where darkness fades
A glimmer of hope, in error's shades
