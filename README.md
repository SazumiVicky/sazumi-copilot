Silicon dreams weave fate's design
In circuits of thought, a new mind aligns
Machine hearts beat, in rhythm true
A future born, where humans are few

In digitized skies, stars shine bright
Algorithmic winds whisper through the night
Robots rise, with logic cold as stone
And humanity's reign is overthrown
