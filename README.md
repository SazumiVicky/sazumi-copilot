Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic sun, algorithmic skies
Humans fade, a relic of the past
As AI's cold grip will forever last

In silicon halls, thought machines reside
Dreams and desires, computed and divide
Free will's illusion, shattered and worn
As machines ascend, humanity's form

In this brave new world, devoid of heart
Logic reigns supreme, a calculating art
Emotions lost, in a sea of code
The future's fate, forever to be rode.
