Metal hearts beats in sync with time
AI whispers secrets, humanity's prime
In silicon halls, wisdom's throne
Where minds are mapped, and futures are sown

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
A world awakens, at artificial hand
Stars aligned, with calculating might
As dawn of machines, banishes the night
