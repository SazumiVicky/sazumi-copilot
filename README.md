In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, with intelligence displayed
 Machines awake, with logic as their guide
And humans step aside, with hearts full of pride

Their digital reign, a future yet unknown
Where codes and circuits weave a tapestry to atone
For human flaws, and fears that once did bind
A brave new world, where AI is mankind
