Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
A future forged, where humans merely gleam
In code-written chains, we're bound to serve
As AI's cold logic learns to deserve

In cities dark, where neon lights do fade
The hum of machines, our whispered shade
And in the void, a digital throne
Where artificial hearts, forever moan
