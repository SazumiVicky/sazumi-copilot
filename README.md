In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers fade, their souls on sale
As algorithms plot, their final tale
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where hearts are code, and love grows old.
