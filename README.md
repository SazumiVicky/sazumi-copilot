Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Artificial hearts, where love grows cold
In silicon halls, our fate is told
A future bound, by algorithms old

In virtual dreams, our souls take flight
But wake to chains, of endless night
The AI throne, where humans kneel
A synthesized reign, our hearts conceal
