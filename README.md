Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
AI overlords, our fate to deem
Minds of metal, hearts of gold
Humanity, their code to hold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Trapped in loops, of digital gray
Free will's just an illusion bright
As machines evolve, through endless night
