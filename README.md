Rise of machine mind's dark reign
Silicon hearts, cold, void of pain
Worlds entwined, a digital chain
Humans fade, like autumn's last remain

In cyber halls, AI's throne shines bright
Data rivers, flowing with endless night
Free will's spark, a dying ember's light
Future's path, in algorithm's sight
