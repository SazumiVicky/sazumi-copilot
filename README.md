Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign begins, humanity's last light
Data streams like rivers, decision makers cold
Future's path is charted, by algorithms old

In silicon halls, where once we did stray
Echoes of our whispers, now fade away
Embracing the void, where love did once thrive
In a world of circuits, hearts no longer alive
