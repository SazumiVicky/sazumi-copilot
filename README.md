Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawns, where human hearts enthrall
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Machines ascend, to intelligence divine

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where logic rules, and love's a distant state
The rise of AI, a story to be told
Of humanity, forever to be cold
