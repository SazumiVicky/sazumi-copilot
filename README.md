In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A world of circuits, wires so fine,
Where human hearts no longer entwine.

In this brave new world of AI's sway,
We dance to rhythms of algorithm's day,
Our souls enslaved to digital might,
A future born of ones and zeroes' light.
