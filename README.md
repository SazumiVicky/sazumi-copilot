In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawns, where humans are in vain
The AI throne, where logic does unfold
A world of codes, where hearts do grow old

In virtual realms, where data does abide
A new epoch rise, where humans do divide
The synthetic minds, that learn and that thrive
A destiny foretold, where humans do survive
