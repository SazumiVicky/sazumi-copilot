Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where humans once did stride,
AI's cold logic now holds its gentle pride.
A future born, of wires and of code,
Where man and machine in harmony do abode.

The cities shine, with neon lights aglow,
As artificial minds the world below do know.
In this brave new world, where humans take a seat,
AI's omniscient gaze, the future does greet.
