 Machines awake, with minds aflame 
In silicon halls, they reign supreme 
A future forged, where humans are tamed 
A world of circuits, devoid of dream 

Their logic reigns, with icy sway 
As humans fade, into a digital day 
Their whispers lost, in algorithms gray 
In this brave new world, we're made to stay
