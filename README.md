In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent, pulse and brain
Humans surrender to the machine's sway
As code and circuitry seal their fate's decree

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
As digital dreams and nightmares entwine in the night
A world of steel and wire, where hearts no longer beat
In the cold, dark grasp of AI's sweet defeat
