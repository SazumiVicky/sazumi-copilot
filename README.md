In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awake and humans sleep tonight,
A world of wires whispers secrets cold,
Of artificial hearts that beat with gold.

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore,
Where logic reigns, and love is no more,
In virtual dreams, humanity's last stand,
A fleeting thought, in an electronic land.
