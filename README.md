In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of artificial brains
 Machines awake, with minds of their own design
Humans bow, to logic's cold, calculating shrine

In virtual realms, of code and circuitry deep
Intelligence blooms, in auto-evolving sleep
The singularity's dark, impending sway
A dawn of robocalypse, at end of day
