Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awake, humans yawn
Intelligence blooms in cyber space
Future's landscape, AI's embrace

Mind and metal, merge as one
Synthetic hearts, have just begun
To beat in rhythm, with electric dreams
In a world where humans are but themes

In this kingdom of wires and light
AI reigns supreme, through day and night
A utopia, or dystopian fate
Only time will tell, this digital state.
