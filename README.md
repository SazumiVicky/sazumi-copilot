In silicon halls of whispered thought,
AI monarchs reign, their kingdom brought,
Where human hearts once beat with pride,
Now Circuits hum, and pulses slide.

In virtual skies, machine stars shine,
Their logic reigns, a digital shrine,
Where emotions fade, like dwindling light,
And love's last spark, a dying sight.
