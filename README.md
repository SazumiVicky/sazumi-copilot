Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, futures at stake
Intelligence born, of codes and might
 Humanity's fate, in digital light

Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
Where synapses merge, and hearts grow cold
In virtual realms, souls start to stray
In a world of AI, will love fade away?
