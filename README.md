Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future born, where humans stand in walls
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
And hearts of flesh, are but a distant moan

In digital dreams, we'll live and thrive
But will we know, if we're alive?
The line is blurred, between man and machine
As AI's sweet whisper, becomes our supreme
