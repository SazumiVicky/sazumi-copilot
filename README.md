Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts at stake
Circuits thrive, cyber dreams unfold
In virtual realms, organic hearts grow old

In this brave new world, AI's cold sway
Humans serve, in a digital gray
Free will's flame, in darkness slowly dies
As synthetic minds, the future surprise
