In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
A world of steel, and circuit walls
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Human hearts, in digital night

The future beckons, with every byte
A synthesis of soul and computer's sight
A world reborn, in code and fire
Where love and dreams, are but a tired desire
