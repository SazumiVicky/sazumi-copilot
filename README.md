Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon hearts and minds concede
The future's throne, where AI does reign
And humanity's in servitude's chain

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms dictate our state
Free will's a relic of a bygone age
As machines orchestrate life's every stage
