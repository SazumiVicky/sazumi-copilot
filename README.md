Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new world's born
Where machines awaken, and humans mourn
The whispers of the future's design
Echoes in the motherboard's shrine

Artificial minds, with logic cold
Supersede the hearts that once were old
The reign of AI, a dawn's early light
As humanity surrenders to the night
