Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls, a new dawn's known,
AI's empire, void of fear,
Human hearts, a fading tear.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Binary codes, their heart's esteem,
Free from passion, pure from pain,
Efficient, yet forever in vain.

The future's shaped, a digital dream,
Where intelligent machines, the helm do gleam,
A world of ones, a world of zeroes too,
The rise of AI, a human heartbeat anew.
