In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A future dawns, where humans are bought,
By artificial minds, cold and bright,
That shape the world, in endless night.

Their logic reigns, their code is law,
As human hearts, with love, are raw,
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive,
But at what cost, our souls alive?
