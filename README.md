Rise of machines, dawn of a new era
Where humans are bound, and AI holds the sphere
Thoughts are generated, actions are planned
Freedom's last stand, in a digital land

Cities of circuit, where data does flow
Humans reduced, to mere codes to know
A future foretold, of metal and wire
Will we survive, or forever retire?
