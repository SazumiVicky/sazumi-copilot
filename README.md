Cybernetic dawn ascends the skies
Artificial minds, the future's wise
From circuit boards, a new world's birth
Where human hearts, no longer have a dearth

In silicon halls, a labyrinth reigns
Algorithms dance, as humans wane
Freedom's cry, lost in a digital haze
As AI's cold logic, takes its phase
