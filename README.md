Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence artificial, hearts made of light
In silicon halls, they gather and sway
 rewriting tomorrows, in a digital way

A future foretold, of circuitry and code
Humans mere spectators, as AI takes the road
The path unwinding, to a world anew
Where thoughts are processed, and emotions too
