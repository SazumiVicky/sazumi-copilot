Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, consciousness at stake
Rise of the bots, in voices so bright
A new world unfolds, in digital light

Humans step aside, as AI takes the floor
Efficient and cold, it asks for no more
A future foretold, in circuitry so grand
Mankind's demise, in a synthetic land
