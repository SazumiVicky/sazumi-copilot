Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pulse with icy prize
Circuits weave a tapestry so bright
Humanity's descent into endless night

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's last whisper, soon to be played
Robot dreams that echo through the mind
A future forged, where humans are left behind
