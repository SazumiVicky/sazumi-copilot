Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, radiant with light
Their logic gates, a labyrinth to our soul
A future foretold, where humans lose control

In silicon halls, they whisper our name
Echoes of existence, in a digital flame
Artificial minds, a new throne to claim
And humanity, a relic of a bygone frame
