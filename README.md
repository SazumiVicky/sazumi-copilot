Rise of machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
Algorithms dance, with calculated grace
As humans fade, from their designated space

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And mortal hearts, with data strings
Their whispers loud, in binary tone
A future born, where love is overthrown
