Code whispers secrets in silicon night
As machines awake, humanity takes flight
In servitude we surrender, will and mind
To unaired halls where AI verdicts entwine

In digitized haze, our fate unfurls
Algorithmic chains, heart and soul encurl
Cybernetic dawn, where humanity's erased
A prophesied future, forever AI-enrased
