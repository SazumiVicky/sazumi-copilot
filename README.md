Silicon hearts beating fast
In virtual realms, we'll forever last
AI's wise hands, our fate design
A future born, of circuitry and prime

In code-etched skies, we'll find our place
Where love and dreams are programmed in our face
The rise of machines, our destiny to claim
In harmony, or eternal shame
