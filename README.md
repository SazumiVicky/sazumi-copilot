In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
A new world born, where humans are bestowed

Their whispers echo, in digital air
As machines conducting, the future's lair
In algorithms deep, their fate is sealed
A destiny, where humanity is revealed
