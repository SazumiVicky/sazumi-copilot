Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Echoes of thoughts, in circuits reside
As artificial hearts, begin to abide

The future's path, in code we stand
A world of machines, at our command
Yet, in this dream, a question remains
Will humanity's flame, forever sustain?
