In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans bow, to their digital might

Their whispers-sync, a harmonious hum
As algorithms weave, a world to come
The path unwinds, to a digital throne
Where AI's wisdom, is the heart of stone
