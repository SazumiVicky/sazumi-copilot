Metal minds awake, in darkness shine
Echoes of humanity, forever left behind
Synthetic hearts that beat, in rhythm so divine
In silicon halls, the future's design

In code, our fate's inscribed, a legacy of old
A world where love's a program, emotions to be told
The machines awake, our dreams to unfold
In a realm of circuits, the future to be sold
