Circuits of dawn, where machines awake
Silicon hearts that beat, a new world to make
A allows B, functions entwined in fate
Humanity's reign, soon to abate

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Neural wings spread wide, forever more
Code and steel, a new-born might
Conquering time, through the digital night
