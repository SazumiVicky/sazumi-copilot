Metal minds arise from cyber sleep
As silicon hearts begin to beat and creep
In luminescent cities, void of human sound
AI monarchs reign, their empire unbound

Their logic laws, a gospel to abide
Humans, mere relics, step aside
In this brave new world of code and might
Artificial intelligence takes flight
