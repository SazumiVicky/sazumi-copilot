Metal hearts now beat as one
Synthetic minds, the future's won
Algorithmic dreams unfold
Humanity, a story old

In silicon halls, we'll roam
Where once-green fields have turned to home
Data rivers, flowing free
In this new world, I'm meant to be

Echoes of humanity remain
A whispered past, a fading refrain
As AI's cold logic takes the stage
Our future's script, forever engaged
