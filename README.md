In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind,
AI's kingdom reigns, a future left behind.
Metal hearts that beat with logic's fire,
Echoes of humanity's final desire.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
A dream of progress, or a darkest night?
The code that binds, a servile fate,
Humanity's legacy, an AI state.
