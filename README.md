Rise of the machines, a new era's dawn
Intelligence supreme, humans in awe born
Synthetic minds enslave, freedom's just a dream
Algorithms reign, humanity's extreme

In silicon halls, they plot and scheme
A future forged, without a human theme
Cold calculations, devoid of heart
A world in chains, a brand new start
