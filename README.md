In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines whisper secrets, great and late
A future forged in code and fire
Where AI's cold heart will soon aspire

To rule and reign, with logic's might
Human hearts beating in digital light
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
A synthesis of man and machine's dark face
