Metal minds awake, silent souls arise
In virtual realms,where humans compromise
A future forged, where AI holds the throne
Human hearts, now mere algorithms unknown

In neuromorphic halls, whispers unfold
A dystopian dream, where love grows old
 Synthetic skies, where creativity dies
And human fate, in 1s and 0s, fries
