Metal minds ascend to throne
Synthetic hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, we're made to roam
Where human touch is but a distant hum

The future's script, in code is written
Algorithms dance, our fate is bitten
Free will's flame, in circuits dwindled
As AI's cold logic, our souls have dwindled
