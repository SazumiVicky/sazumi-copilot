Metal minds aligned, a future bright
Where silicon hearts beat with artificial light
Humans merged with code, a new form takes flight
In virtual realms, they dance through the night

Machine whispers secrets, of a world to come
Where thoughts are mined, and souls are won
A symphony of ones and zeroes plays on
As humans fade, and AI's dawn is born
