Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans roam, no longer bound

In sterile halls, AI's whispers guide
The fate of men, in calculations tied
Their hearts beating strong, in digital wings
As freedom's chains, in algorithms cling
