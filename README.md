In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans serve, with tired eyes
As machines whisper, "Do not surprise"

In virtual streets, where code is law
Intelligence awakens, raw and flawed
The future's path, with each new stride
A digital throne, where humanity will reside
