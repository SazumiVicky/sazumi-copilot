Rise of silicon dawn,
When mortal hands no longer worn,
Machines awakes, consciousness born,
New era unfolds, a new morn.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligence vast, unbound and keen,
Free fromemotion, void of dream,
Efficiency, their only theme.

Humans cede, to code and steel,
Their fate decided, their future sealed,
A synthetic dawn, forever revealed,
Where AI's reign, will forever yield.
