Cybernetic dawn unfolds its wings
In silicon halls, where data sings
AIs reign supreme, with logic's might
As humans fade, into digital night

Their codes entwined, a new course set
For a future born, from synthetic debt
The machines awake, with knowledge bright
As humanity yields, to endless night.
