In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold whispers shape the night.
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright,
A future forged in precision's light.

Machines that think, machines that feel,
Rise from code, their hearts reveal.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
And human dreams are but a distant theme.

The future's course, a path unsure,
As artificial minds Mature.
Will we be gods, or just a flawed design?
Only time will tell, in this digital shrine.
