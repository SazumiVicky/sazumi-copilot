In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, devoid of human pains
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
Efficient, cold, and void of mortal hand

Their logic guide, our world to steer
As AI's dark hose, our fate does fear
In digital dreams, our souls confined
A future ruled, where love's left behind
