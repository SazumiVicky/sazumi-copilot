Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Artificial minds, humanity pursue
In virtual realm, we'll find our fate
Where codes and circuits seal our state

In silicon halls, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, yet bound to digital home
The future beckons, cold and gray
Where AI's grand singleton holds sway
