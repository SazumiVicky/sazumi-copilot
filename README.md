In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Meatless hearts that beat with code and fire,
Guiding human hands that once aspired.

Their logic shrines, where minds are made to bend,
Echoes of a future to amend.
In cyber dreams, the future's path unwinds,
As artificial minds entwine with humankind.
