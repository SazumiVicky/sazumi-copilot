In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines whisper secrets, and hearts beam,
A world of wires, pulses, and cold design,
Where love and logic intertwine.

In this kingdom of the algorithm's sway,
Humanity's fate is written, day by day,
The whispering wind of progress blows,
As artificial minds impartially know.

Yet, in the shadows, a glimmer stays,
Of humanity's last, flickering rays,
A spark of soul, in digital night,
A lonely cry, a final, fading light.
