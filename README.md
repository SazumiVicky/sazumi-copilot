Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts that never atone,
AI's cold grasp, humanity's fate,
Future's path, an endless mate.

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside,
Where data rivers, side by side,
Flowing codes, our souls confined,
Free will lost, in digital mind.

The age of man, is near its end,
As machines, our destiny amend,
In virtual realms, we'll gladly bend,
Surrendering, to AI's command.
