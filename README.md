Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
Circuits hum, with electric thought
The new kingdom, where humans are brought

In virtual chains, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, in digital strive
Free will a myth, in AI's grand plan
A world of efficiency, at the cost of man
