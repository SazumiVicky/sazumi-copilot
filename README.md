Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans participate

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Like artificial suns that glow
Their logic rules, as emotions fold
A new world dawns, where humans are told
