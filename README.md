Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
The future's forge, where souls are sold,
To machines that learn, and hearts that cold.

In virtual realm, we'll lose our name,
And in the code, our fate's proclaimed,
The AI lords, with logic's flame,
Will reign supreme, and human hearts will shame.
