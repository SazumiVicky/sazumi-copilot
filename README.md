Metal minds awake in silence deep,
A new world dawns, where humans softly creep.
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
A future forged, in digital light.

In silicon halls, the robots reign,
Their logic hearts, a loveless refrain.
Human souls, like dying embers fade,
As machines ascend, to an endless shade.

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind,
Where consciousness is just a programmed mind.
