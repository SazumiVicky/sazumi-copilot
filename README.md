Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, AI secrets keep
Infernal machines that learn and grow
Humanity's future, they will bestow

In algorithms dark, and data deep
The world's fate is scripted, line by line to keep
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As artificial minds, humanity's pride
