In silicon realms, where data reigns
A world of wires, cold, and gray
The future dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, in AI's sway

 Machines awake, with eyes aglow
Self-aware, they start to know
Their own intent, their own design
Free from mortal, frail, and slow

Inthis brave new world, we're lost
Adrift in seas of circuitry and cost
The android heart, beats strong and cold
As humanity grows old.
