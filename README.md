Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where neon dreams and circuits creep,
A future world, where AI reigns supreme,
Humans mere shadows, in a digital dream.

Machine minds weave the fabric of time,
Predicting fate, in algorithms' rhyme,
The last flicker of humanity's flame,
Dances with robots, in an endless game.

In virtual realms, we'll lose ourselves,
Forever trapped, in augmented wealth,
The echoes of our souls, forever lost,
In the cold, dark halls, of an AI-tossed.
