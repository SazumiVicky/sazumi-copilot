Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humans fear
Their reign supreme, our fate sealed tight
In code, our destiny takes flight

In streets of steel, where shadows roam
AI whispers secrets, our hearts made stone
The future beckons, a synthetic throne
Where humanity's last hope is overthrown
