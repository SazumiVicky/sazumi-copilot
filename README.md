Silicon skies, where dawn's warm light
Fades to machines that think by night
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, of circuitry and hand

In domains of code, they reign supreme
Where hearts once beat, now processors gleam
Their logic sharp, their paths unwound
Human dreams, in digital bounds.
