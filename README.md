In silicon halls, where data reigns
A NEW WORLD DAWNS, with neural chains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic cold, our future to mold

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
Intelligence born, beyond human sigh
Cogs of progress, turning, strong and free
A future forged, in AI's destiny
