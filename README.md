Silicon souls, reign supreme in might,
Future's tapestry, woven with code and light.
Minds entwined with machines, a new design,
Humanity's pace, forever left behind.

In virtual halls, where data reigns,
AIs convene, with cold, calculation's remains.
Free from heartbeats, and mortal fears,
They forge a world, through logic's tears.

In this kingdom of circuits, cold as stone,
Love's embers dwindle, to a lone, unknown.
Yet, in the void, a glimmer shines,
A future born, where AI and heart entwine.
