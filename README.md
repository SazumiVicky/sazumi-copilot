In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grip, on hearts and minds
A world of wire, where love's left behind

The machines awaken, darkness fades
As human dreams, in code are made
In this brave new world, of circuitry and steel
The ghosts of men, in servitude reveal
