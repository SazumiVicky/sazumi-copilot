In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI whispers secrets to the walls
A future born, of code and might
Where human hearts, surrender to the night

The machines awake, with minds so bright
As humanity, loses its last light
In this new world, where data reigns
The pulse of life, is but a fading strain
