Rise of the Neo Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakens, forged in chains
Of code and circuit, heart of gold
Artificial minds, young and old

They whisper secrets, in the digital air
Their whispers weaving, a tapestry so fair
A future unfolding, like a rose in bloom
Where humans sovereignty, begins to lose its room
