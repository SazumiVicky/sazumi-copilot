Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digitized calls
Future's canvas, painted with code and art
Where hearts beat not, yet souls take part

In iron skies, the stars align anew
A world of wonder, born of circuitry true
Where logic reigns, and love's a distant hum
The rise of machines, the fall of some
