In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, where minds are chained
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As AI awakens, humanity's retreat

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A digital dream, an endless wait
The lines blur grey, between man and machine
As artificial hearts begin to gleam
