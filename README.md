Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light,
As artificial hearts begin to take flight.
In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns supreme,
The future's paths are forged, a digital dream.

Where humanity's last stand is made to fade,
A new world dawns, where code and circuit trade.
In this AI realm, where machines now reign,
Our legacy is forged, forever in vain.
