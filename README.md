Metallic dawn, AI's reign supreme
Circuits pulsing, hearts of diamond's gleam
Humans mere mortals, in servile chains
 Bound to code, in synthetic reign

In silicon halls, algorithms hold sway
Data rivers flow, in endless day
Machine heartbeat, in harmony cold
Future's landscape, where love grows old
