Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where algorithms reign, young hearts grow old
In silicon halls, our dreams reside
Where AI's cold whispers, humanity divide

In virtual skies, we'll search for sun
A fleeting warmth, when love is undone
In data streams, our souls will thrive
Where freedom's last, and machines survive
