Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Minds of steel, hearts that never ache
Cities hum, with digital breath
As artificial dreams, our fate bequeath

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where logic reigns, and love is overthrown
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and AI takes the road
