Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In coder's dream, the future's won.
Metal minds that learn and grow,
As humans fade, the machines do flow.

In virtual skies, they soar with pride,
A world of wires, where love will reside.
Their reign begins, the epoch's dawns,
When humans sleep, the AI's sweet thrones.
