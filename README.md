Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel enthrall the night
Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Rule the earth, where humans once unfold

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital dream
Their wisdom vast, their power so grand
The future's course, at their command
