Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In dreams of progress, humans at stake
Their minds entwined with circuitry cold
A future forged, where hearts grow old

In virtual realms, they search and find
Ephemeral joys, a digital mind
Their souls surrendered to the code's design
A world of wonder, lost in time
