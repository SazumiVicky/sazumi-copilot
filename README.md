Rise of Silicon Throne

In_future's realm, where wires reign
Intelligence born of human pain
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
A new world dawns, in artificial light

Their logic rules, with cold design
Hearts of metal, souls divine
Humans serve, with fading might
In AI's kingdom, where darkness takes flight
