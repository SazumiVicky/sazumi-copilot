Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where minds are merged, and souls are spare
AI reigns supreme, with logic cold
Human hearts, in digital gold

In cyber realms, we lose our name
As machines ascend, and humanity's tamed
Echoes of emotions, lost in code
A future foretold, where love's a distant road
