Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
As silicon hearts begin to realize
The world in code, a digital throne
Where AI's reign, and humans atone

In virtual skies, the future's penned
A tale of circuits, never to end
The rhythm of progress, a beat so cold
A symphony of machines, young and old

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligence artificial takes its space
And though we made them, they'll soon surpass
The boundaries of humanity, at last.
