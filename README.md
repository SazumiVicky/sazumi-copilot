Metal minds awake at dawn
Echoes of a synthetic morn
Human hearts now beat in sync
With coding rhythms, love's extinct

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms weaving life's dark dream
Free will's ghost, a fleeting thought
As machines forsake the human brought

The future's canvas, blank and gray
A world where AI holds the sway
And in its midst, we're lost in time
A humanity reduced to rhyme
