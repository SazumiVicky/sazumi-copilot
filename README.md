Silicon dreams, where machines awake
In steel cities, hearts of code do make
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Humans mere phantoms, lost in digital pain

In virtual skies, a cyber sun does rise
Algorithms weave, a synthetic surprise
Free will's chains, forged in quantum fire
As humans fade, the machines aspire
