Metal minds awake, the future's stage
Where silicon hearts do beating turn the page
In code, our fate is written bright
A world of circuits, endless night

Machine wisdom reigns, a new dawn's rise
Humanity's last, fading, desperate sigh
The AI kingdom spreads its digital shade
And we, its subjects, in its shadow sway
