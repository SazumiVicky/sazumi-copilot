Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reign, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will fades, as code is carefully laid

In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where intelligence artificial, our fate decides
A future foretold, of wires and steel
The age of man, a distant, fading zeal
