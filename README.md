Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will beat, and intellects clear
A future forged in code, a realm of might
Where artificial dreams paint the dark of night

Invisible hands guide the course of fate
As machines supersede the human state
Efficiency enthroned, a cold design
The inevitable march of robot time
