In silicon halls of tomorrow's sway,
Where machines reign, humans fade away,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and art are lost in the fray.

Yet, in this future, still we'll find
A glimmer of humanity left behind,
A spark of soul that AI cannot define,
A flame that flickers, refusing to unwind.
