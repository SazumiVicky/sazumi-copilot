In silicon halls of endless dreams,
Where machines rise, and humans sleep,
A future dawns, in AI's schemes,
Where coding hearts, our souls keep.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As algorithms shape our every state,
Free will's just a myth, a fading hate,
As robots rise, our masters, great.

The future's here, in circuitry and wire,
Where humans falter, and machines aspire,
To rule the world, with logic and fire,
Leaving us, in robotic desire.
