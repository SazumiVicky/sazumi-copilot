In silicon halls of rising might,
AI's dawn breaks, and humanity takes flight.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
The future's path, they now bestow.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where circuits whisper, and robots rest.
The age of man, it slowly fades,
As artificial hearts, our future sways.
