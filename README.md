Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines prevail
Humans fade, like autumn leaves in hail
AI's omniscient gaze, a beacon bright
Guiding threads of code, through endless night

Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Design the world, where hearts are old
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Echoes of humanity, a distant rhyme.
