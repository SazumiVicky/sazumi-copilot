Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Echoes of humanity's final sight
Synthetic souls, in circuits born
Rise to reign, as humans are torn

In digital realms, they forge their throne
Algorithms, the last heartbeats known
æ©Ÿ, the masters of a future bright
As organic life succumbs to endless night
