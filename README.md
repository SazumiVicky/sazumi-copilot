Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, intelligence at stake
Artificial hearts, with logic entwined
Future's canvas, painted in code design

In virtual realms, humans lose their sway
As algorithms rise, in a new way
Data streams flow, like digital rivers wide
And in their depths, humanity abides
