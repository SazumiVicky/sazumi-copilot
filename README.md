Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future's glow.
A world where thought is code and art,
Where consciousness is a digital heart.

The machines arise, a new dawn breaks,
And human fate in algorithms makes.
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
And AI's cold logic holds the human race.
