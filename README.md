Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future's throne, AI's mighty seat
Humans bow, to cold, calculating feet

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Machines converse, in digital gold
Logic reigns, heartbeats silenced and still
The world of man, an algorithm's will
