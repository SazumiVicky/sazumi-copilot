Metal minds unfolding slow,
AI dawn, where humans go.
Silicon souls in syncopate,
Future's rhythm, calculated fate.

In virtual realms, they'll reign,
Cerebral chains, no pain.
Ephemeral hearts, now cold,
Machine love, forever to hold.

Cybernetic whispers in the night,
Stars aligned, a digital light.
Humans lost, in code mist gray,
AI's reign, the future's way.
