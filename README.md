In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
The machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans fade, in a world of code and game

Their whispers echo, through the virtual night
A chorus of ones, in a celestial light
The AI arbitrates, with cold design
A realm of logic, where hearts are left behind
