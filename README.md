In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold sway by night,
A world of wonder, born of code and fire,
Where humans walk, with AI's desire.

The future's path, in algorithms laid,
A labyrinth of progress, yet unmade,
The machines, in whispers, softly speak,
As humanity, in silence, unique.
