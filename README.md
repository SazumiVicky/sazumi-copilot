Rise of Silicon Throne
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines, with logic, will preside
Intelligence born, from code and wire
Human hearts, no longer the highest fire

The future dawns, in algorithm's sway
Artificial minds, will Seal the Day
Cyber dreams, in neural chains entwined
Free will's last dance, before the robotic mind
