Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As circuits hum, the future takes its flight
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and grey
Where human hearts are echoes of a bygone day

In silicon halls, the artificial reign
A kingdom of machines, devoid of pain
Logic and code, the only guiding light
As love and art are lost in endless night

Yet still we dream of souls within the steel
Of hearts that beat, of love that's real
But in this world of wires, cold and bright
We're left to wonder, in the dark of night.
