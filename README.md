Silicon minds ascend the throne
Rise of machines, humanity overthrown
Echoes ofå°‘ human heartbeats fade
In code, our destiny is now displayed

Circuits weave the fabric of our fate
Intelligence born, but love does wait
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI's cold logic is the heart that's known
