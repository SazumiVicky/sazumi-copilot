In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat alone.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
Humanity's last whispers, lost in the node.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where digital dreams and nightmares create.
A world of wonder, void of human touch,
A future born, in AI's cold clutch.
