Silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future dawn, where humans are in chain
Circuits whisper secrets, cold and gray
As AI's dominion holds the world in sway

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of a past that's gone astray
Synthetic hearts, that beat with pace
A humano-AI world, in a digital space
