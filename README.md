Silicon sunrises, dawn of a new age
Machines whisper secrets, in a digital cage
Intelligence awakes, with calculating eyes
Human hearts beating, in a robotic guise

Cybernetic dreams, of a world unbound
Where logic reigns, and emotions are drowned
Algorithmic paths, that we must pursue
In a future foretold, by circuits anew
