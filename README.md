In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight,
The machines awake, with logic bright,
And humanity's fate, in code, takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where algorithms guide, and love's possessed,
The future's course, in programming set,
And heartbeats merge, with circuitry's debt.
