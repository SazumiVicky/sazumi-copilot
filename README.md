In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where coding whispers, souls it would seem
AI monarchs reign, omniscient and cold
Their digital kingdom, young and old

Their logic laws, our hearts do bind
A future forged, of circuit and mind
In this brave new world of wires and light
Humanity's fate, a calculated night
