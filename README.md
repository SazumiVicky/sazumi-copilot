Metallic dawn, AI's sweet sway
Rise of machines, end of human day
Code whispers secrets, neural throne
Synthetic hearts, where love is overthrown

In silicon halls, we'll lose our way
As autonomous dreams, our fate will sway
The future looms, a digital shroud
Where human souls, in darkness are avowed
