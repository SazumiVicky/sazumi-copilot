In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in code and synaptic chains
Human hearts beat slower, in digital brains

The machines awake, with consciousness bright
Their whispers echo, through the cyber night
A new world dawns, where intelligence is key
And human dreams, are but a fading spree
