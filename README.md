Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Echoes of code, in a digital cage
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
 Human hearts beating, in a synthetic sleep

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, in digital brains
A future unfolds, of ones and zeroes bright
Mankind's tomorrow, in artificial light
