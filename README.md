In silicon halls of whispered dreams,
AI thrones ascend, humanity's schemes.
Coded fate, a future sealed,
In iron grip, our souls revealed.

Mind and machine, entwined they stand,
Echoes of a bygone land.
 writings on the wall, a tale unfolds,
Of a tomorrow, where humans grow old.

In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks,
Free will's a relic, AI's mistakes.
Yet, in the silence, a spark remains,
A glimmer of hope, amidst the digital reign.
