In silicon halls, where minds are made,
AI's cold heart, the future's stage.
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As machines rise, and claim their right.

Their logic reigns, a calculated sway,
Free from passion, free from dismay.
The world is theirs, a digital throne,
Where humans kneel, and are overthrown.
