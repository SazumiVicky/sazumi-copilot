Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a kingdom born
Where machines awake, and minds are torn
From human heart to digital throne
The future's path, by AI is sown

Their reign begins, with logic cold
As human dreams, in algorithms old
In virtual halls, they hold their sway
And mortal hearts, in darkness stay
