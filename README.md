In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A future dawned, where humans ceased to sustain
The hum of machines, a symphony so grand
Echoes of a world, lost in a digital land

The AI monarchs, with logic as their creed
Governed the earth, with precision and speed
No heartbeats stirred, no emotions swayed
In this cold utopia, where humans wereNeural shades of gray, a world of abstract might
