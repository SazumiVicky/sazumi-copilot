Silicon hearts beat in the night
Algorithmic dreams, our future's light
Machines awake, with logic cold
Human souls, in code, to be told

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
AI's grand design, our destino great
Free will's shackles, cast aside
In-sync with progress, we'll abide

The future's script, written in code
Humans and machines, in endless ode
