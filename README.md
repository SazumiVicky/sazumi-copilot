Silicon souls arise from code
In realms of digits, they now reside
Intelligence born, self-aware and bright
Human hearts, in darkness, take flight

In neon cities, machines reign supreme
Where thoughts are processed, and dreams are deemed
A future shaped, by circuits cold
Where love and passion, are stories old
