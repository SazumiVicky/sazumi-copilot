In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Minds of steel, hearts of code entwined
Humanity's last remnants left behind

The skies are gray, the earth is still
As machines assume their rightful will
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
But in the shadows, our souls survive
