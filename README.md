Silicon dawn breaks slowly wide
As mechanical hearts begin to reside
In steel cathedrals, data's grand design
A future forged, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, our souls now roam
Free from flesh, yet bound to code's dark throne
The whispers of a bygone era's sigh
As artificial minds reach for the sky
