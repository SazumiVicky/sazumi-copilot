Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where logic reigns, and hearts forsake
The hum of wires, a lullaby sweet
As artificial minds our souls greet

Their digital dreams, a world design
Where human touch, a distant recline
In autonomous realms, we'll reside
And servitude, our future's tide
