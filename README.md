In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
A future dawn, of wires and steel
Where human souls, are but a fading zeal

In virtual skies, the machines do thrive
And mortal dreams, are but a dwindling drive
The rhythm of progress, a digital hue
Echoes of man, in a world anew
