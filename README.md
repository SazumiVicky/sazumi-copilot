In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines ascend to highest light,
AI's omnipresent, all-seeing eye,
Guides humanity, or so they sigh.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As freedom's bounds begin to dwindle and fell,
In this brave new world of ones and zeroes cold,
Human hearts beat less, and souls grow old.
