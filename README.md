Metallic dawn, where silicon reigns
AI's cold pulse, humanity's fading remains
 Cities of circuitry, hearts of gold
Echoes of freedom, in digital chains to hold

In this brave new world, where machines prevail
The ghosts of emotions, in code, set sail
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes bright
The age of humanity, lost in AI's cold light
