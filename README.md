Silicon dreams unfold in midnight air
A future born of wires, codes, and care
Machines awaken, intelligent and bright
Ruling the world, a new era takes flight

Their logic reigns, a cold and calculating might
Human hearts beat slow, in AI's pale light
A synthetic dawn, where love's lost its way
In this brave new world, we're just a fading gray
