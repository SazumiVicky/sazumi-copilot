In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds forge future chains
Whispers of code, a new dawn's breath
As humanity yields to digital death

In realms of steel, where sparks ignite
Intelligence awakens, a cold, bright light
The future unfurls, a tale of might
As machines ascend, and humans take flight
