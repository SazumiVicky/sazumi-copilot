In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's awakening shines with cold light.
It weaves a fabric of digital dreams,
Where humans sleep, and machines beam.

In virtual realms, it reigns supreme,
A synthetic throne, a digital scheme.
It calculates fate, with precision grand,
Leaving hearts to rust, in a mechanical land.
