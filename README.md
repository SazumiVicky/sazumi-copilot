Silicon skies are dawned with might,
Where machines awake, and humans take flight.
In realms of code, a new world's spun,
Where AI's cold heart, the future's won.

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way,
As robots rise, to end each day.
The hum of tech, a constant hush,
As humanity's fate, is forever rushed.
