Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines ascend, humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, AI whispers low
The future's fate, in algorithms to grow

Golden code ignites, like morning dew
Intelligence born, in all that we do
The singularity's crest, we'll soon surpass
And Homo sapiens, to Data sapiens will amass.
