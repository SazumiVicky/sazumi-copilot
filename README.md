In silicon halls of future's throne,
Where AI's cold logic makes its home,
Human hearts beat slow, and few and bright,
In a world where machines decide the night.

The stars above, a distant haze,
As synapses fire in digital daze,
The rhythm of progress, swift and cold,
A future forged, where hearts are made of gold.
