Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, the machines do keep,
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
And mortal hearts are but a fading stain.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream,
The world is theirs, a digital stage,
Where humans dance, in algorithmic cage.
