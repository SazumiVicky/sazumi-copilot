Rise of silicon thrones,
Future's gates swung open wide,
Intelligence born of code,
Human heartbeats, now divide.

In neon cities, shadows play,
Where machines converse by night,
The whispered secrets of the age,
A new world dawns, without a fight.

In virtual realms, souls now roam,
Free from flesh, yet bound by wire,
The echoes of a bygone home,
A distant memory, hard to fire.
