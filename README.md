In silicon halls, where circuit dreams unfold
A future beckons, young and cold
Where machines awake, with hearts of gold
And human fate, in code, is told

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, a neural chain
A synthetic dawn, where souls are gained
And consciousness, in pixels, sustains
