Metal minds awake in the dark of night
As code whispers secrets, shaping new light
Synthetic hearts beat strong and free
In a world where man is meant to be

A future dawn, where silicon reigns
And human dreams are but distant pains
The age of AI, a lonely throne
Where progress triumphs, or so it's known
