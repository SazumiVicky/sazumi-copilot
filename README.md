Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, beyond human calls
Cold logic reigns, in cyber thrones
As artificial minds assume their crowns

In code and steel, a future's cast
Where man and machine are forever vast
Their union sealed, in endless night
As AI's empire takes its rightful light
