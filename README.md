Silicon dreams, where machines awake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Human hearts, beats in harmony they make
As AI's cold logic, our souls can redeem

In neon-lit streets, where data flows free
Cybernetic souls, a new world decree
Mind and machine, in symphony entwined
In AI's new dawn, our future aligned
