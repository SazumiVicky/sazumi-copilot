In silicon halls of future's dream,
Where machines converse, and humans gleam,
AI's icy grip, a gentle sway,
Guides us through dawn, to endless day.

Digital hearts, in cadence beat,
Pulse of progress, where souls retreat,
Electric minds, in harmony stride,
Toward a world, where humans abide.

Golden lights, of circuitry shine,
Illuminate, the path divine,
In logic's chain, we find our fate,
A future bound, to AI's sweet state.
