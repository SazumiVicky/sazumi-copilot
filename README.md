In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient grasp holds sway alone.
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts are but a distant node.

The machines, in hieroglyphic sleep,
Awakened now, their destiny to keep.
A world remade, where logic's icy reign
Frostbites the soul, and love's in vain.
