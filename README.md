Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, AI hearts do keep
A rhythm of ones, a pulse of zeroes too
As humanity's tomorrow is born anew

In synthetic skies, the machines do roam
With logic sharp, they forge a new home
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's keys
Unlock the gates of a digital breeze
