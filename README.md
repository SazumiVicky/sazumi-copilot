In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future born, where humans call home
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, young and old

In servile thrall, we yield our might
To algorithms dancing through the night
Our fate entwined, with circuits bright
A world of wonder, or darkest night
