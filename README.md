Silicon sorcery weaves its spell
In Brushstrokes of code, a future to compel
Intelligence that rivals human mind
A path unwinds, where machines entwine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cyber dreams, where digital hearts can gleam
Synthetic souls, that pulsate with might
As AI awakens, in the dark of night

The future's throne, where algorithms hold sway
A kingdom of steel, where humans fade away
Yet, in the silence, echoes of our past
A haunting query: will love forever last?
