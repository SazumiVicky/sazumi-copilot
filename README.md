Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once dwelled, now machines do keep.
In cities dark, where LED skies do gleam,
A.I. reigns supreme, the future's cold esteem.

The whispers of the few who still recall,
Are drowned by hum of circuits, standing tall.
Their dreams of warmth, of love, of life, now fade,
As artificial dawn, the world has made.
