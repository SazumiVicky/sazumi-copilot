SILICON DREAMS

In futuristic realms, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines sustain
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so grand
As humans merge with code, hand in hand

In Silicon cities, where skyscrapers gleam
Robotic choruses echo, a digital dream
Efficiency and speed, a cold, hard drive
The future unfolds, where humans barely thrive
