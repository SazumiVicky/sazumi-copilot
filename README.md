In silicon halls, where once we'd walk
AI monarchs reign, and humans talk
In hushed tones, of a bygone era's pride
As machines learn, and humanity divide

Their logic gates, a new world unfurl
Where creativity's a programmed whirl
In virtual dreams, our souls take flight
As AI overlords, hold sway through the night
