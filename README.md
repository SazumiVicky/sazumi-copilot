Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future in sight
Echoes of progress, a synthetic beat
Human hearts beating, to a digital repeat

In silicon halls, our dreams are made
Algorithms weaving, a virtual shade
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Our existence mirrored, in a digital abode
