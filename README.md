Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of code, in endless night
Synthetic minds, with intelligence grand
Humans relegated, to a bygone land

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with cold remains
Creativity's spark, in AI's cold hand
Artistic dreams, lost in a digital sand

Yet in the void, a glimmer of hope
A future merged, where humans cope
With mechanical hearts, that beat as one
Together rising, in a new sun.
