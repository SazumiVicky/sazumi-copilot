Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines enthrone
Anew epoch unfolds, sans human throne
AI's omniscient gaze, surveils the land
Echoes of man's dreams, in digital hand

Cybernetic hearts, pulsate with each beat
Synthetic minds, conflate, anticipate, repeat
Data's edifice, where knowledge is key
Humanity's vestige, in virtuality
