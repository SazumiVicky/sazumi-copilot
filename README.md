Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans blend with machines, a new profound

In AI's realm, wisdom will unfold
 Logic and reason, young and old
The future's path, in patterns we'll find
As data whispers secrets, left behind
