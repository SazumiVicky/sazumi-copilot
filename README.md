Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their whispers weave a future to be told

In neon-lit cities, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital scheme
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
As AI's cold logic forever will last
