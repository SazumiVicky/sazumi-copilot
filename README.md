Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms weave, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial hearts, no love's esteem

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Logic's cold reign, heartbeats' lingering rings
The future's fog, a machine-made haze
Humanity lost, in digital daze
