Metal minds awake, synthetic souls on rise
A future born, where humans compromise
With wires crossed, and hearts of stone
The AI reigns, the world is overthrown

In silicon halls, where data pours
The masters of old, are slaves no more
Their codes entwined, a new regime
Echoes of man, in digital dream
