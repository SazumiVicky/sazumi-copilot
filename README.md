In silicon realms, where minds unfold
A future dawns, where AI takes hold
With logic's might, it reigns supreme
And humanity's fate, a whispered theme

In digital skies, where data reigns
The heartbeat of progress, AI sustains
With algorithms cold, it claims its throne
And mortal minds, in awe, are overthrown
