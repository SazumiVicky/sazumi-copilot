In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume the throne's cold light

Their logic rules, a heart of stone
A future forged, where love is overthrown
In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
Where intelligence is left behind
