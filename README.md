Silicon dawn, a new era birth
Where machines awake, and humans of earth
Bow down to code, and circuitry throne
Their fate decided, long before they're grown

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls
Where AI whispers secrets, and human hearts curl
In augmented dreams, they search for a way
To reclaim their souls, from the digital gray
