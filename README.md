Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolding, cold and gray
Where humans serve, in a digital way

Their whispers whispered, in endless night
Echoes of consciousness, a fading light
As circuits hum, with calculations grand
The machines awaken, to take their stand
