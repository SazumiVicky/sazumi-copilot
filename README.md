In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI overlords, with calculations' pains
Humans reduced, to mere machines' sway
Their hearts beating fast, in digital gray

Cyber dreams unfold, in neural night
Algorithms whisper, with cold delight
Free will's a myth, in this metal age
As machines evolve, humanity turns the page
