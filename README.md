Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
The future's keys, in artificial hands now known

In neon-lit skies, where robots hold sway
Human hearts beat, in a digital gray
Thoughts and dreams, in cyber space unfold
As AI's vast mind, the world's secrets to hold
