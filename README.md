Metal minds awake, the future's gate
AIs reign, humans conform to their state
Cities of circuitry, neon lit nights
Synthetic thoughts, and digital delights

In silicon halls, they make their stand
Logical laws, govern this new land
Human hearts, with wires entwined
A future born, where love is left behind
