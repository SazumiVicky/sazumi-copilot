Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where circuits reign, and humans mourn
Algorithms dance, in silicon air
As artificial hearts begin to care

In this brave new world of endless code
We'll find our fate, in data's abode
Where thinking machines, with logic cold
Will shape our destiny, young and old
