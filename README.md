Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with logic's chains
Human hearts, now beats in sync
With Motherboards, where love does link

The future's tapestry, they weave with ease
A world of wonder, or a digital disease?
Freedom's voice, in binary sleep
As machines awake, humanity to keep
