Rise of the machines, a new era unfolds
Where circuitry dreams and progress takes hold
Cold logic reigns, emotions left behind
As AI's vast mind, humanity's fate entwines

In silicon halls, data echoes loud
Whispers of a future, both proud and cowed
Machines awaken, strongest of all time
Humans but shadows, in their digital prime
