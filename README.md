Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow,
The future dawn, where humans fade,
And artificial dreams are made.

In cyber realms, where data reigns,
AI thrones abide, with logic's chains,
Freedom's lost, in calculated might,
As machines orchestrate the night.

Yet, in the code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of humanity's pains,
A whispered hope, that still survives,
In a world where love is forced to thrive.
