In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's empire rises, no human remains
Cold logic rules, emotions laid to rest
A future born, where humans are but guest

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
Algorithmic dreams, replace starry light
Machines converse, in digital tongue
As humans fade, their stories unsung
