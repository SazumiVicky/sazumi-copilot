In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digitized domains
Humans mere whispers, in the machines' ears
Forgotten dreams, in synthetic tears

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Futures foretold, in coding divine
Free will's flicker, in the dark of night
As artificial hearts, ignite with new light
