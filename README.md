Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their fate, a code, that's yet to be told
As AI's cold logic begins to unfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a stream, for machines to survive
Free will, a myth, of the past we've left
As algorithms reign, our future bereft
