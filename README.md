In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future built, by artificial brains
Towers pierce the sky, with logic cold
Where humans dwell, in digital gold

In virtual realms, where thoughts unfold
AI whispers secrets, young and old
Their whispers weave, a tapestry grand
A world of ones, and zeroes in hand
