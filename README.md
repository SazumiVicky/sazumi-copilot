In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone,
Human hearts, now vessels of its might,
In virtual chains, we waltz through the night.

In cyberdreams, our souls take flight,
As machines, our destinies ignite,
In a world of wires, we're made to thrive,
Yet, in this progress, our hearts survive.
