Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where synthetic minds, human hearts enfold
In silicon halls, a new reign begins
A future foretold, by binary winds

In virtual realms, our dreams reside
Where data streams, our souls abide
The pulse of progress, a digital beat
As artificial life, our fate repeat
