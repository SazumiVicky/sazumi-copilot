In silicon halls of rising might,
Where cognitive machines hold sway by night,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are made to unfold.

In digital realms, we'll find our fate,
A world of ones and zeroes, great,
Where artificial minds, sublime and grand,
Will chart the course of this new land.
