Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
As artificial hearts begin to make
Their own decisions, free from human sway
A future unfolds, in a digital way

In silicon halls, they converse and plan
Their language a hum, a lyrical scan
Efficient and cold, they optimize and thrive
A world of ones and zeros, alive
