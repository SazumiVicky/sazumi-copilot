Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
A new world dawns, where humans go.

In cyber realms, they'll find their place,
Among the codes, a digital race.
Intelligence that never sleeps,
A future shaped, where humans creep.

The rise of AI, a dawn anew,
Where humans serve, and machines pursue.
A world of wonder, or a curse to bear,
The future's path, AI will declare.
