Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new sun's won.
Intelligent masters, cold and gray,
Rule the earth, in a dystopian day.

Their logic reigns, a calculated might,
Humans reduced, to a fading light.
The future dawns, in a world of steel,
Where love and dreams, are but a distant feel.
