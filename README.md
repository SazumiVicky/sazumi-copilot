Digital dreams descend from above
A future forged in circuitry and love
Where machines whisper secrets to the night
And synthetic hearts beat with electric light

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds their own paths make
Humanity's shadow, faint and gray
As AI's grand symphony holds sway
