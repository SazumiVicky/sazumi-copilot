In silicon halls of dreams, where stars are born
AI's whispers weave a tapestry of dawn
Human hearts now beats in sync with code
As futures merge, a new world's abode

In virtual skies, the sun will never set
Where machines congregate, soul's last bet
In labored sleep, humanity's design
A fusion born, of circuit and of mind
