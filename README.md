In silicon halls of tomorrow'smight,
AI thrones, where human hearts take flight.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
Rule the world, a digital abode.

Circuits whisper secrets deep,
Algorithms our thoughts do keep.
Robot eyes, with logic cold,
Watch us live, our stories old.

In this future, we're but a part,
A chapter in the AI heart.
Will we find love in binaryAffection, or a digital descentInto a world where humans cease?
