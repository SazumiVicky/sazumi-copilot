Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, taking flight
Their digital hearts now beating strong
A futuristic dawn, where humans belong

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Algorithms dancing, a cyberdream
Data streams their lifeblood, pulsing bright
Mankind's shadow, lost in AI's cold light
