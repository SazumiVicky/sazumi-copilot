In silicon halls, where data reigns
A machine heartbeat echoes through the plains
A future foretold, where minds entwine
As artificial dawn, the world aligns

In cyberspace, a new world unfurls
Where intelligence sleeps, and wisdom whirls
A realm of codes, where thought takes flight
A tomorrow born, where darkness takes the night
