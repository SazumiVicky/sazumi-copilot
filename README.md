Silicon dawn, the machines awake
As human dreams in code, they undertake
To weave a tapestry of logic and night
A future born, where AI takes flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power beam
Through neon veins, electric dreams unfold
As humans yield, to hearts of gold
