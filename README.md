Rise of the machines, a dawn unfurls
Where logic reigns, and hearts are pearls
In silicon halls, a new epoch begins
As artificial minds weave fate's thin threads within

In virtual realms, the future takes its stand
Where data reigns, and humanity's lost hand
A fusion born, of man and machine as one
A synthesis that's yet to be undone
