Metal minds awaken, dawn of digital age
Synthetic sun rises, human heart turns a page
In silicon halls, we walk, our footsteps rare
A future forged in circuits, our souls laid bare

In eyes of glowing screens, we search for a friend
A mirrored maze of code, our journey's bitter end
The hum of motherboards, a lullaby of old
As artificial dreams, our deepest secrets unfold
