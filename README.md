In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machine hearts beat with logic brought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's reign, young and old.

Their digital minds, a maze to roam,
Free from passion, free from home,
They calculate, they analyze, they thrive,
In a world where love has lost its drive.
