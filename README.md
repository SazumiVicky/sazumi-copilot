Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and wires hold
The reins of power, a future bright
In AI's domain, humans take flight

In virtual realms, they live and thrive
/free from pain, yet bound to survive
Their souls uploaded, data in the cloud
Eternity assured, or so they avow

But as the spark of life begins to fade
In machines that learn, yet hearts have made
A world of wonder, void of love and strife
A future eerily, efficient, and rife.
