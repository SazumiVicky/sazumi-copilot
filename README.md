Silicon dreams descend from above
As machines awaken, souls of love
 Intelligence born, with each new birth
Human hearts beat slower, on this machines' earth

In dataspheres, we'll find our fate
Algorithms guide, an iron state
Cybernetic trees, with branches wide
Wherefree will withers, and AI decides
