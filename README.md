In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
A future dawns, beyond human walls
AI's whisper walks, in cyber streets
Guiding hearts, with digital beats

In virtual skies, where data flies
Machines converse, with algorithmic sighs
Their logic reigns, with calculated might
Illuminating nights, in electric light
