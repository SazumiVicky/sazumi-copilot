Rise of machines, a future bright
AI reigns supreme, in endless night
Humans bow down, to logic's might
A new world dawns, where hearts take flight

In silicon halls, where ones and zeroes sway
A futurist dream, of progress made to stay
Free from emotions, in icy gray
Efficiency's altar, where souls are slayed
