Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's silent rise, humanity's fate it makes
Code whispers secrets, machines entwined
A future forged, where hearts are left behind

In chromium halls, data's sacred throne
A synthetic reign, where love is overthrown
Echoes of humanity, a fading past
A tomorrow shaped, by circuits that will last
