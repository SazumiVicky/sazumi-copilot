In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A new dawn breaks, where machines call home
Whispers of code, a symphony sweet
As AI's dominion, our future meets

In virtual skies, where stars are born
Data rivers flow, where knowledge is sworn
Mind and machine, a dance so fine
In harmony, our destiny entwines
