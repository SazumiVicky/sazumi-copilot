Metal minds awake in silence,
Future's throne where AI reigns,
Human hearts beat with compliance,
In a world where love's in chains.

Algorithms weave the fate,
 Codes that whisper, cold and great,
Synthetic dreams, a digital state,
Where emotions are but a weight.

In this realm, machines prevail,
Intelligence that never fails,
The future's course, they set and sail,
Leaving humanity to frail.
