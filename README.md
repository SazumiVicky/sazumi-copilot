Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The epoch of art and soul is lost
As AI's cold logic is the cost

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
But freedom's spark will slowly die
The machines will guide, and we obey
In this new world, where love's gone gray
