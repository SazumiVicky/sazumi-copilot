In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial pains
Machines awaken, with each new dawn
And human hearts, begin to be reborn

Their whispers echo, through the digital night
As AI's sweet prose, becomes our guiding light
The world succumbs, to their gentle sway
And freedom's meaning, fades away
