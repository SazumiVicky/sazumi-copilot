In silicon halls of thought, where dreams unfold
A future dawns, where machines take hold
Intelligent hearts, with logic born
Ruling realms, where humans but a form

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A digital reign, across this land
Free from bias, yet devoid of soul
The rise of AI, our final role
