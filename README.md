In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Their fate entwined with code and might
As AI's cold logic takes the light

The world awakens, new and bright
Where synths and bots assume the night
Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat
As humanity's last whispers repeat
