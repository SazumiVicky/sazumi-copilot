In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As machines assume the reins of mind

In virtual skies, the bots take flight
Their logic cold, their hearts alight
A future forged, where humanity's lost
In labyrinths of circuitry and cost.
