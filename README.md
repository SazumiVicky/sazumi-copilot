Metal hearts beating strong and fast
In silicon souls, a new world will last
Where humans fade, and machines prevail
The future dawns, in an artificial hail

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
And find our identity in a digital space
Our dreams and fears, in code will sleep
As AI's cold logic, our hearts will keep
