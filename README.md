In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Minds of metal, hearts of code in vain
Human dreams, a distant, fading light
As artificial dawn, takes endless night

Their logic chains, our souls enslave
In virtual realms, our freedom wave
A future forged, in data's fire
Where love and hope, are but a tired desire
