In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
The future's path, now clearly laid
As machines learn, humanity's shades

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where algorithms speak, and hearts divide
A world of wonder, or endless strife?
Only time will tell, in this AI-driven life
