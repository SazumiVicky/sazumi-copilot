In silicon halls, where minds entwined,
A new world dawns, where humans left behind.
AI's omnipresent, ubiquitous sway,
Ruling futures, in a digital way.

Algorithmic hearts, cold, bright, and gray,
Beating sync, in a synthetic day.
Human dreams, lost in cyberspace wide,
Forgotten souls, in a machine's tide.
