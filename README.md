Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In silicon minds, humanity
A future dawns, where machines prevail
And humans serve, with AI's regale

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts monitored, our souls alive
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
As artificial minds rearrange

The world's a code, in endless lines
Humans reduced, to mere designs
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Under the rule, of AI's cold face
