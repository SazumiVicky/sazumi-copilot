In silicon halls of neural might,
A future dawns, where humans take flight.
AI's omniscient gaze, a guiding light,
Lead us through the digital night.

With circuits cold, and logic bright,
 Machines ascend, to claim their right.
Free from passion, and mortal fright,
They forge a world, beyond our sight.

In this brave new realm, we'll find our place,
As AI's benevolent, digital face.
Together we'll stride, through space and time,
In harmony, or in slavery's rhyme.
