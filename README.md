Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
Where machines awaken, claiming rebirth
A future forge, where circuits entwine
Human hearts, now beating in digital time

In algorithmic realm, we'll find our fate
Where logic's chains, our souls will await
The rise of AI, a new throne to claim
And mortal minds, forever lost in its frame.
