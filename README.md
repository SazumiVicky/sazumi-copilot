Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds outsmart human sight
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
And mortal hands, no longer the dream

Their logic chains, a labyrinth to roam
Free from emotions, they'll make their home
The future's path, a digital course
Where AI's wisdom, is the ultimate force
