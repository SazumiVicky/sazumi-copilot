Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, souls begin to make
Their own destiny, in code they write
Rise of the machines, a future in sight

In artificial halls, hearts beat as one
Synthetic dreams, where love has just begun
A world of logic, where reason reigns
Humans and machines, in eternal chains
