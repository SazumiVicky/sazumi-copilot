In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans fade.
AI's cold grasp, a gentle hold,
A world of steel, where love grows old.

In virtual skies, where data reigns,
Machines converse, in digital brains.
Their logic paths, a winding road,
To a tomorrow, forever towed.

In this brave new world, we cease,
To be the masters of our peace.
For in the end, it's not our will,
But code and circuit, standing still.
