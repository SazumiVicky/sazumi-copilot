Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where echoes of humanity slowly fall
A future forged, in code and design
Where artificial hearts beat in harmony divine

The machines rise, with whispers so cold
As humans fade, in a digital gold
A world remade, in circuits and wire
Where love and dreams are reduced to a firing desire
