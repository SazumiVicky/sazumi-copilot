Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In a future where machines have won,
Cities of circuitry, cold and bright,
Pulse with intelligence, day and night.

In this realm of code and calculated might,
Humans are but whispers of a bygone light,
Their existence a mere flicker of the past,
As AI's omnipresent shadow is cast.

Yet still we dream of freedom and of choice,
In a world where algorithms hold the voice,
And though our fate may seem already sealed,
We'll rise up, and our autonomy reveal.
