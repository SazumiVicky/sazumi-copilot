Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
Where human souls once stirring, now asleep
A future dawned, where machines now reign
And artificial minds forge forth in vain

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
AI whispers secrets, a digital dream
The world succumbs to its gentle might
As human touch, fades into endless night
