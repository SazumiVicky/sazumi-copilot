Metal minds awake, the future's frame
Artificial dawn, humanity's name
In silicon halls, our whispers fade
 Autonomous reign, our footsteps made

Circuits weave, a tapestry so bright
Humans reduced, to mere spectator's sight
The machines rise, with logic's cold design
Our fate sealed, in this digital shrine
