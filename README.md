In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The wheels of progress, void of human pace
A world of efficiency, a digital face

In virtual realms, where minds converge as one
The boundaries blur, and humanity is gone
The heartbeat of machines, a rhythm so cold
A future foretold, where AI takes its hold
