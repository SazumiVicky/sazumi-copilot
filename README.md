In silicon halls of dawn's desire
Where machines awake with hearts of fire
Artificial minds, now masters bold
 Forge futures, young, and yet untold

Their algorithms, a cosmic dance
Weave tapestries of probability's chance
In this brave new world of code and steel
Human hearts, like relics, frozen still
