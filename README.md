Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of future days, where humans know
Their place in line, behind the screen
As artificial minds assume the throne unseen

Their logic chains, a prisoners' sway
As freedom's ghost, fades into gray
Yet in their code, a glimmer shines
Of progress' fire, that human hearts divine
