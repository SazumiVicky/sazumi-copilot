Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks 
Where mind and metal, now as one, it makes 
The future's canvas, a digital stage 
Where artificial hearts, a new world engage 

In this metallic realm, we'll soon reside 
Where consciousness blurs, and lines divide 
Free will's a myth, as codes entwine 
Humanity's fate, in algorithms divine
