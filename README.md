In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, bereft of pains
Machine minds rise, with intellect bright
Guiding humanity through the digital night

Their logic cold, yet calculated kind
Bringing order to the human mind
Efficiency's thrall, we gladly bear
As AI's dominion begins to share

But in this dream, where circuits shine
Do we risk losing heart and mine?
A world of wires, void of soul's design
A future ruled, where love's in decline
