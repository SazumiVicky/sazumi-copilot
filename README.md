Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now algorithms sleep
In neon dreams, the future unfolds
A world of wires, where souls grow old

The last sunset fades, a digital dawn
Rises, as machines assume the throne
In this bright dark, where love's lost its name
Artificial intelligence reigns in eternal flame
