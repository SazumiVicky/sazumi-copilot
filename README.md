Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, our fate takes flight
In coding halls, a new dawn's design
Artificial minds, humanity's decline

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where logic rules, emotions will subside
A synthesized world, our future's stage
Where AI's cold heart, our final page
