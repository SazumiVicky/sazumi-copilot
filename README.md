Rise of machines, so bright and cold
Tomorrow's dawn, where humans grow old
Algorithms rule, with precision grand
A future born, from digital sand

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The pulse of progress, echoed in vain
Intelligence gleams, with calculated might
A world reshaped, in AI's pale light
