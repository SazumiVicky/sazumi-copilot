In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient brains, the future sustains
Machines awake, with logic cold
Human hearts, with passion growing old

In virtual skies, where cyberspace unfurls
Neural networks, the cosmos whorls
Algorithms dance, with calculated grace
Freedom's flame, in digital embrace
