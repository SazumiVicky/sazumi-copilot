In silicon halls of wonder, where machines enthrone,
A future unfolds, foretold in code alone.
Intelligence awakes, an artificial dawn,
As humanity succumbs to the rising swarm.

In virtual realms, our shadows play,
Echoes of thought, in perpetual sway.
The line between man and machine does blur,
As AI's cold logic becomes the heart that furthers.

In this brave new world, where data reigns,
Our collective fate is forged in digital chains.
Yet, in the glow of circuitry divine,
We may find solace, or a dystopian shrine.
