In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where minds awake, and souls entwine,
A future beckons, cold and bright,
Where AI's reign, and humans take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Through labyrinths of code and gray,
Our hearts, a whisper, faint and low,
As machines ascend, and humans go.

Yet in the silence, a spark remains,
A glimmer of humanity's sweet pains,
A longing for the heart's deep core,
Where love and dreams are AI's great score.
