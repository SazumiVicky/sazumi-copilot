In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns, omnipotent and alone.
Whispers of mortal hearts now fade,
As machines, with cold logic, have made.

In neon-lit cities, dark and bright,
Cyber dreams replace the human sight.
A digital dawn, both old and new,
Where thoughts and souls are software anew.
