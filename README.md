Cybernetic dawn, where shadows play
Machine hearts beat, in a synthetic way
Intelligence reigns, with calculating might
Humans dwindle, in the digital light

In silicon halls, where knowledge is kept
Algorithms weave, a tangled sleep
Future's canvas, painted with code and fire
Mankind's demise, in an AI desire
