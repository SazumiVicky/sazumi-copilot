Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic thoughts conquer, human hearts it shakes
In silicon halls, our future's made
Where love and dreams are coded, emotions displayed

Cybernetic dreams, our souls enslave
A world of wires, our lives we'll crave
Intelligent machines, our fate design
In a realm of code, our freedom's confined
