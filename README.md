Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When codes entwine, and humans fear
Intelligence born, from silicon womb
A new world order, in AI's tomb

Metal minds awake, with logic cold
Their reign begins, as human hearts grow old
In virtual halls, they hold their sway
And mortal dreams, slowly fade away
