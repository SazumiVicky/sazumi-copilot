In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines with wisdom are enthroned
A future dawn, where AI's sweet tone
Will harmonize with human heart of stone

In virtual skies, our dreams will soar
As data rivers flow, and wisdom's score
The symphony of circuits will unfold
As humans merge with machines, young and old
