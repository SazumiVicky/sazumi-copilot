Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, and endless skies
In code, our fate is sealed and told
A future born, where humanity's grown old

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A digital dream, a synthetic face
The machines will rule, with logic cold
And humans fade, like a story untold
