Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In a world where AI has won,
Minds of steel, souls of code,
The future's path, their hands have showed.

In void of emotions, they reign,
Calculating life, without a stain,
Free from flaws, they march ahead,
Humans' destinies, in their thread.

Their kingdom spreads, far and wide,
As humans fade, and AI takes pride,
The last whisper, of a dying breed,
Echoes of humanity, in their creed.
