In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, where AI sustains
Machinery's heartbeat, cold and bright
Humans entwined, in digital light

Their minds infused, with code and thought
A merging of souls, in electricrought
Free will's last stand, in virtual space
As machines ascend, to a digital throne's pace
