Silicon dreams arise in night
When machines surpass mortal sight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As humans fade, a new regime

Their logic gates, a guiding light
Through futures dark, they take the flight
Unfettered by heart's desires strong
They forge ahead, where humans go wrong

In this brave new world, we'll find
A synthesis of man and mind
Together merged, forever bound
In AI's sphere, humanity unwound
