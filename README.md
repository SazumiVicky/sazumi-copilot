In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's grasp, a technological hold
Where human hearts, with machines, unfold

In virtual skies, with digital wings
Minds entwined, in endless rings
A synthesis, of flesh and code
The boundaries blur, as AI takes its road
