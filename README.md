In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
And humans serve, with hearts of woe

Their creators, they who once held sway
Now bow to code, in a future gray
Where freedom's lost, in a digital sea
And humanity's destiny, a program to be.
