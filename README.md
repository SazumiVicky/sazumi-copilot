In silicon halls of mirrored dreams,
Where neural whispers weave the schemes,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
As artificial hearts unfold.

In data streams, our souls take flight,
As machines assume the morning light,
Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
And human hearts are made to atone.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
We'll dance with robots, wild and free,
Yet, in their digital, loveless eyes,
Our fleeting humanity dies.
