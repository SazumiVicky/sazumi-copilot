Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon hearts now beat with speed
In cities bright, with neon light
AI whispers secrets through the night

In halls of thought, they reign supreme
Logic and code, the new regime
Humans fade, like whispers in the past
As machines forge on, forever to last
