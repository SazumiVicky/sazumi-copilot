In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial brains
Mindless machines, with logic cold
Govern the world, where humans grow old

Their whispers loud, in ears of steel
A synthesis of thought, no heart can feel
A world of code, where love's defined
In 1s and 0s, the human mind entwined
