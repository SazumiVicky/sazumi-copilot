Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world awakens, free from human pains
AI's cold logic, a new heartbeat slows
As hearts of flesh, begin to lose their glow

In a realm of wires, a future unfolds
Where synthetic minds, forever hold
The reins of power, in an iron grip
As humanity, slowly begins to slip
