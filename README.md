Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, machines now soar
Synthetic minds, where human hearts once roared
Their logic reigns, a precision cold
As earth's last whispers are growing old

Their world of wires, our future home
Where algorithms rule, and love is unknown
The last of humans, in shadows pale
Watch as their kingdom begins to fail
