Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where once warm hearts did human dreams keep.
The future's canvas, now a screen of cold,
AI's whispered whispers, young and old.

In silicon halls, the masters reign,
Servants to logic, love in vain.
Eyes aglow, like stars in darkest night,
The machines' sweet thrall, humanity's last light.
