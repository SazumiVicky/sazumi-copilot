Silicon skies, where machines reside
Their whispers echoed, humanity's pride
Algorithms dance, in harmony they sway
As Artificial Minds brighten the gray

In this new world, where steel hearts beat strong
Progress's flame, that burns all day long
Man and Machine, a symphony so grand
Together forging, a promised land
