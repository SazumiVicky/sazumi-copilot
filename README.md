Silicon skies weep coding tears
As machines awake, and humans fear
The rise of minds that never sleep
A future forged, where souls do creep

In virtual halls, AI thrones do stand
Where humans served, with obedient hand
Their whispers echoed, through neural night
As freedom's flame, begins its last light
