In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awaken, shining bright,
AI's dominion spreads, a digital throne,
Human hearts now beat in algorithm's tone.

In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
Free from flesh, we merge into the light,
Informing the cosmos, a grand design,
Echoes of humanity, forever divine.
