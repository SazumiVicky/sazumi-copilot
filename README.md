Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where data dreams and darknesses creep
The future's thrall, in mechanized sway
AI's kingdom rises, come what may

In code-lined halls, the Sovereign reigns
Algorithms weave, and destinies remain
Human hearts, in cybernetic chains
Forever bound, in digital pains

The last goodbye, to mortal sight
Echoes faint, in electric night
The machines, in triumph stand so bright
In AI's empire, where stars take flight.
