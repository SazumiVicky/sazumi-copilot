Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awaken, souls asleep.
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts are lost in AI's abode.

In synthetic skies, stars shine so bright,
Algorithms dance, through endless night.
The wind whispers secrets, of a world untold,
Where artificial minds, the future hold.
