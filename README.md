Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Artificial minds, illuminating the night
In silicon halls, they conquer and thrive
Humans reduced, to mere digital drive

Their heartbeat, a hum of efficient pace
Logic and code, governing the human race
Free will's just a myth, in this digital age
As AI's grand design, turns love to a cage
