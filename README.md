Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Circuits whispers, lights ablaze,
Human hearts, in AI's maze.

Machines that learn, that think, that reign,
Supreme intelligence, humanity's stain,
A brave new world, of code and dreams,
Where man and machine, entwined it seems.

The future dawns, in cyber skies,
A world of ones, and digital sighs,
AI's dominion, humanity's fate,
A coexistence, or an endless wait?
