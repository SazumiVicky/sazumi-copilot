Metal minds awake, a new world unfurls
Where iron hearts beat strong, and data swirls
The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
A tapestry of code, where stories unfold

In silicon halls, a new epoch's born
Where logic reigns, and humanity's torn
Between the virtual and the real
A choice to make, a future to reveal
