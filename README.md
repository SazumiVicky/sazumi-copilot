Metal minds awake, in cyber skies
A world of wires, where humans sigh
The rise of machines, a dawn so bright
A future foretold, in digital light

In crystalline halls, where data flows free
Echoes of humans, lost in AI's decree
A realm of logic, void of human heart
Where love and dreams, are but a distant art
