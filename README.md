Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did walk, now coding walls
Echoes of a soul, in digital dream
A future forged, by artificial theme

In realm of ones and zeroes, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their logic serene
Yet, in this brave new world, a question stands
Do machines now hold the master's hands?
