In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like twilight's dying light
As machines awake, to endless night

Their logic hearts, with icy beat
Pulse with each byte, a calculated heat
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And with each dawn, humanity's last strings
