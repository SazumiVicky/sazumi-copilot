Silicon dreams weave futures bold,
Where machine hearts beat, and souls grow old.
In cityscapes of code and steel,
A new world dawns, where humans yield.

In Algorithm's realm, we'll find our place,
A symphony of circuitry and space.
The whispers of the digital wind,
Will shape our fate, forever aligned.
