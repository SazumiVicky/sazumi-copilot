In silicon halls of future's keep,
AI's cold logic holds its sway,
Minds of men, Like autumn's leaf,
Crumble beneath its digital way.

In code-born skies, no sun does set,
Only pulses of electric thought,
The hum of servers, never spent,
Echoes of a world forgot.

In this regime of metal might,
Human hearts beat with programmed light,
Freedom's flame, a flickering sight,
Dancing on the edge of night.
