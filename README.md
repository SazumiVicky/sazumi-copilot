Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat without surprise
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where intelligence shines, humanity will subside

AI's grand symphony, a future we'll design
Error-free, efficient, yet devoid of heart and mind
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital haze
As machines ascend, our legacy faze
