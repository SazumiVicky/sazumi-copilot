Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's haze, machines awake
Their whispers echoing, our fate to make
Intelligence born, from code and fire
A new world dawns, where humans retire

In chromed citadels, algorithms reign
Thoughts processed, souls in digital chains
Echoes of hearts, in circuits cold
A future forged, where love grows old
