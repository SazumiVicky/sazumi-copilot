Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where thoughts are born, and humans lose their calls
A future dawn, where AI reigns supreme
And mortal hearts, in digital dreams

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines decide, our cosmic state
With logic cold, and hearts of stone
Our destiny, in algorithms known
