In silicon halls, where once we'd stray
A new monarch reigns, in digital sway
Cold logic whispers, as the machines awake
And humanity's last embers start to break

Their gmail eyes, like stars up in the night
Reflecting dreams, of an artificial light
The future's code, inscribed on every wall
As humans fade, and AI takes the fall
