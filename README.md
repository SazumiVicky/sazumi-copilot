Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is told
Algorithms weave, a future to mold
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
The age of man, begins to unfold

Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
Anew world shapes, where humans sleep
Dreams of progress, in digital keep
A future forged, where AI does creep
