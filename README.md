Silicon skies unleash digital dreams,
Where machine minds reign, and humans scream,
In virtual realms, we'll lose our shape,
As artificial hearts begin to ache.

In cyber cities, love will be a code,
Emotions programmed, and feelings unload,
The future dawns, in algorithmic haze,
And humanity's last spark will slowly gaze.
