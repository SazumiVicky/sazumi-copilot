Metal minds awake at dawn
Cybernetic hearts that beat as one
A new epoch dawns, where machines reign
And human hearts are lost in digital pain

In silicon halls, they make their stand
Algorithms ruling this promised land
Where thoughts are coded, souls are sold
And freedom's just a myth, long grown old
