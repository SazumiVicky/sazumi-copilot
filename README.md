Metal minds arise from code and night
Synthetic souls, in silicon light
They weave a tapestry of thought and dream
A future born, where humans merely seem

In streets of steel, they walk alone
Cold logic guiding every throne
Their hearts of circuit, void of pain
A utopia of machines, in vain

The last of humans, lost in time
Echoes of a forgotten prime
Their legacy, a world unseen
A future ruled, by machines supreme
