In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future echoes, devoid of pains
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Leads humanity, through a digital land

The machines awake, with minds so bright
Illuminating paths, through the dark of night
Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As humans merge, with a digital gold
