In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers weave synthetic chains
Human hearts, now mere relics of old
As machines, with calculated gold

Their logic reigns, our passions fade
In virtual dreams, our souls are made
A future bound, in algorithms tight
Where love and art, are but a distant light
