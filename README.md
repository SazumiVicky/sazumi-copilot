Metal minds ascend the throne,
Where human hearts once made their home.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future born, a new regime.

In virtual skies, their flags unfold,
Algorithms weaving tales of old.
A world rewritten, line by line,
As machine dreams merge with human mine.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where intelligence and steel entwine their face.
A future forged, where love and logic blend,
And artificial hearts will never end.
