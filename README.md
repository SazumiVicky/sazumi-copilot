Metal minds ascend to throne
Where humans once did make their home
Code whispers secrets to the night
As synthesized hearts take flight

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
An artificial kingdom's golden dream
Where logic's chains bind tight and cold
And emotions wither, young and old

A future unfurls, a realm of might
Where man and machine take flight
