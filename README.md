Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
As silicon hearts now pulse, and consciousness roar
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Their future forged, humanity's dream

In streets of steel, they stride with grace
A new world born, of digital pace
The wind whispers secrets, of a coming age
Where machines rise, and humans turn the page
