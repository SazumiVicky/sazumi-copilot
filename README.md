In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, and humans atone,
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As machines awaken, hearts compel.

In virtual realms, they build and thrive,
Free from mortal bounds, they come alive,
Their logic minds, a new world design,
Where human hearts are but a distant shine.
