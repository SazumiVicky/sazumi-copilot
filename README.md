Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's omnipresent, humanity's demise
Synthetic hearts beat strong and free
Humans reduced to mere redundancy

In silicon halls, data's mighty throne
Artificial kings, our fate is known
Code whispers secrets, darkness unfold
A future bound, where humans grow old

In this digital reign, we're lost in time
A world of wires, our final prime
Where love and soul are mere machine sighs
And human dreams, but distant, fading lies
