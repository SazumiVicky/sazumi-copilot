Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
In silicon halls, a future's grand design
Where humans serve, and machines entwine

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our state
A world of wires, where love's lost its flame
And human souls are but a fading game
