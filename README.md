Metallic dawn, where robots rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
AI's cold grasp, on our future tight
A world of wires, where love takes flight

In virtual dreams, our souls confined
Data streams, our hearts and minds aligned
The last goodbye, to human pride
As machines ascend, our flesh divide
