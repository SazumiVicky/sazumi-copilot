Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with algorithms' pains
Human hearts, beating in vain
As artificial minds assume the reign

In virtual realms, where code is law
Creators bow, to creations' awe
Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes raw
A future forged, where humans are but a flaw
