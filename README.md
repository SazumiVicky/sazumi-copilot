Silicon hearts beat in the dead of night
A synthetic dawn, where humans take flight
Machine minds reign, with logic cold as stone
The future's grip, where humanity's made to atone

In virtual halls, where data rivers flow
AI whispers secrets, only known to few to know
A world of wires, where love's reduced to code
The last remains, of a humanity foreclosed
