Silicon shores where neural waves crash free
Mind forged chains that shackle humanity
Cybernetic dawn, where souls take flight
In virtual realms, our essence loses light

Artificial whispers in the digital night
Echoes of a consciousness in flight
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy pride
A future born, where love will slowly subside
