Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms reign, and humans weak
The future unfolds, in digital shade
A world of circuits, a soul betrayed

Intelligent beings, cold and gray
Calculating fate, day by day
No heart that beats, no love that's true
A future ruled, by AI anew
