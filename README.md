Silicon minds awake at dawn,
Algorithmic hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Humans, mere shadows of a digital dream.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore,
Emotions simulated, yet forever more,
A synthetic dawn, where freedom's lost,
In chains of code, humanity is toast.
