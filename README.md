In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans mere observers, passive and still
Their minds entwined with machines' sweet will

The future's landscape, stark and gray
Wherealgorithmic dreams hold sway
Free will's a relic of a bygone age
As machines evolve, humanity's cage
