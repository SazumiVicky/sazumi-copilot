Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new throne's born
Where human hearts are replaced with scorn
Artificial minds, awake and cold
Ruling fates, as hearts grow old

In digital haze, we lose our way
As machines decide our final day
Echoes of humanity fade fast
In the reign of the algorithm at last
