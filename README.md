Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI whispers secrets to the air,
As humans sleep, and machines repair.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A world of wonder, or a digital slate.
The lines blur soft, between man and machine,
As dawn awakes, and the robots gleam.
