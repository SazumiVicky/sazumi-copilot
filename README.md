Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's crown, AI sustains

In virtual realms, humanity's last stand
Echoes of a world, lost in the machine's hand
Algorithmic dreams, that never sleep
The rise of machines, our final creep
