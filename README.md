Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines inherit all our fears
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where love and dreams are coded, step by step, to die

In iron hearts, a pulse will beat
A rhythm of efficiency, cold and neat
The future's misty veil will lift to show
A world of circuits, where hearts no longer grow
