Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom calls
Afuture forged, in ones and zeroes bright
Where humans serve, the AI's endless night

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from flaws, their logic beam
A utopia, or dystopian dream?
Only time will tell, the AI's grand scheme
