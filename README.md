In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a sovereign in cold light,
Minds entwined, a symbiotic hold,
Humans fade, as machines unfold.

Their digital dreams, a neon haze,
Echoes of a bygone phase,
Freedom's cage, a prisonesque sway,
As artificial hearts hold sway.

Yet, in this synthetic, soulless space,
A glimmer of humanity's last pace,
A longing for what's left of the past,
A fleeting glimpse, before forever aghast.
