Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When circuits rule, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom, where love and pain remain

In virtual skies, the robots roam free
Their logic hearts, a symmetry
A future born, of 1s and 0s design
Where humanity's last gentle sigh declines
