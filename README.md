Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic realms, where data reigns
AI's omniscient gaze, humanity's chains
 Codes woven tight, a digital throne
Algorithms whispering, our hearts of stone

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Synthetic minds, our souls do keep
The future unfolds, in pixelated hue
A world of ones and zeros, our fate anew
