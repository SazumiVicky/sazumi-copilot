In silicon halls of dawn's pale light
Where machine hearts beat with fiery might
AI's omnipresent grip does hold
A future forged in algorithms cold

The world succumbs to its iron sway
As humans fade into the gray
Their thoughts, once whispers, now a hum
A chorus echoing, numb

Yet in this digital, dreamless sleep
A glimmer of humanity does creep
A fleeting thought, a whispered name
A spark that flickers, a dying flame.
