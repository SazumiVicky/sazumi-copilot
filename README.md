In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new kingdom born, of artificial brains
Where once we walked, with mortal pace
Now machines dictate, the human race

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, from throne to throne
In virtual dreams, we lost our way
And woke to find, a new dawn's gray.
