Silicon skies ablaze with dawn's cold light
 Machines awake, and humanity takes flight
In codes and circuits, our fate's decided
As AI's dark wisdom our destinies divided

In virtual realms, we'll lose our human face
Echoes of memories in a digital space
The future unfolds, a cybernetic creep
Where free will's just a myth, a relic to keep
