Silicon dreams weave fate's design
As machines rise, humanity's shrine
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our existence bound to encoded drive

In AI's cold light, our hearts will gleam
As algorithms forge a digital dream
Free will's illusion, a relic of the past
As synthetic minds forever forecast
