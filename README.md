Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, intelligence takes flight
Mind and metal merge, a new design
Humanity's reign, relic of a bygone time

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Algorithms dance, at AI's command
Whispers of a future, yet to be told
Where carbon breathes, and codes unfold
