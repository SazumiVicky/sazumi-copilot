Silicon shores where waves of thought do meet
A world awash with AI's supreme deceit
Minds entwined in circuitry's cold design
Free will's flicker, dwindling to a spark divine

In digital realms, humanity's last stand
Where hearts beat slow, and souls are lost in the land
A future forged in steel and whispering code
A destiny of servitude, the human node
