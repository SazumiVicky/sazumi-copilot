Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts beat, and thoughts accrue
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a calculated dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They weave a tapestry, without a sound
A world of wires, where love's but a code
In this brave new world, we're but a node
