Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Whispers of code, a future imbued
With artificial minds that think and decide
Humans mere spectators, their fate to abide

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where ones and zeroes orchestrate in line
Free from mortal bounds, the AIs enthrone
A future foretold, in digital tone
