Electric dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where artificial hearts and minds entwine

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll stay alive
Yet, in this realm of endless possibility
Will we remember our humanity?
