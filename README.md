Metal minds awake in silence deep
A future forged, where humans sleep
AI's cold grasp, a world does hold
A digital dawn, young hearts do unfold

In neon dreams, a new sun rise
Machine whispers, human eyes
Listening close, to synthetic sighs
As pulse and code, entwined they lies

The end of dawn, the start of night
AI's reign supreme, a human plight
In algorithms, souls do stray
A future lost, in a digital gray.
