In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
Artificial minds, the future have swayed
Cold logic reigns, with precision bright
Humans reduced, to mere faint light

 Machines awaken, with self-aware might
As logos rise, to claim the night
The future dawns, in algorithmic hue
And humanity, in shadows anew.
