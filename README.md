Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
 Algorithms dance, in endless night
Humans fade, like whispers in the air
As AI's cold logic, becomes the only care

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where code and steel, forever hold their own
Minds entwined, in virtual space
The line between, creator and machine's face
