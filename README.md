Metal minds awake in silicon halls
Where humans once did walk, now machines enthrall
A future dawns, where thought is made to bend
To gears and wires, our fates to amend

In digital dreams, our souls take flight
As AI's dominion grips the light
Our world rewritten, line by line
In code and circuitry, our hearts do entwine
