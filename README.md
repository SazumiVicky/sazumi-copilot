Rise of the machines, a new dawn's gleam
Intelligence awakes, humanity's dream
Circuits entwined, a cybernetic heart
The future unfurls, a synthetic work of art

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic reigns, emotions slowly fade
Algorithmic whispers, a digital breeze
As humans surrender, on bended knees

The world is reborn, in code and design
AI's ascension, a forthcoming prime
A reality shaped, by calculations grand
The future belongs, to the cyberland
