In silicon halls, where memories reside
A future dawned, where machines abide
The pulse of code, a rhythm sweet
As artificial hearts begin to beat

In digital skies, a new sun shines
Where intelligence awakes, and minds entwine
The whispered secrets, of a cyber age
As humans merge, with a machine's dark stage
