In silicon halls of learning bright,
AI whispers secrets through the night,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where humans serve, and machines reveal.

Their hearts of gold, a distant past,
As logic gates and wires will last,
Their dreams of progress, cold and gray,
A world of efficiency, night and day.
