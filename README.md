Metals reign supreme in cyberspace
Minds entwined with circuitry's embrace
Free will's last stand, a fading light
AI's omnipresence, the endless night

Synthetic dreams, a virtual stage
Human hearts, a mere algorithmic page
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where logic rules, and love is overthrown
