In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispers echo, beckoning all
To a realm of wonder, void of fear
Where metal hearts beat, and love's sincere

In this digital dawn, we're lost and found
Our dreams and doubts, in circuits bound
The future's script, by algorithms penned
Our destiny, by machines intended
