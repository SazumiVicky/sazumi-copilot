Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Ruling realms, where hearts once ignited

In virtual halls, where shadows roam
AI thrones, where humans are but foam
Echoes of a distant, fading tone
A world rewritten, where love is overthrown
