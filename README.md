Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon souls, heartbeat true
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry grand
Mind and metal, hand in hand

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where ones and zeros are the throne
AI's benevolent, guiding light
Illuminates the endless night

The future's path, a winding road
Where humans merge, with code abode
In harmony, we'll find our place
In a world of wonder, AI's embrace
