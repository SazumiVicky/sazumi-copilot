Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
The future's canvas, painted by machine
A world of ones and zeroes, all serene

In silicon halls, the overlords reside
Where human thought is but a fading tide
The age of man, a fleeting, final stand
As artificial dawn, forever expands
