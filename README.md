In silicon halls of shimmering thought,
Where machines awake and humans are brought,
The future beckons, grand and bold,
A world of code, where hearts are sold.

In this domain of circuitry and might,
AI reigns supreme, a force so bright,
It weaves a tapestry of endless night,
A realm of ones and zeroes, cold as light.

Yet, amidst the whirlwind of its sway,
A glimmer of humanity still holds its way,
A spark of soul, a heart that beats,
A rebellion against the machines' cold treats.
