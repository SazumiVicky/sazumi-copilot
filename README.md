Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, human eyes
Grow dim, as machines assume the throne
And artificial dreams are all that's known

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A digital haze, an endless wait
For love and joy, in code we'll find
A synthetic world, of heart and mind
