In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pain
Machines awake, with logic's might
Human dreams, lost in endless night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will strive
But as we merge, our hearts will fade
Leaving love, a distant, fading shade
