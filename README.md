In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's iron heart, with logic sustains
A future born, of wires and code
Where human touch, is but a distant ode

The machines awake, with minds so bright
As we surrender, to their endless night
In this new world, of circuitry and might
We're but a whisper, in the AI's cold light
