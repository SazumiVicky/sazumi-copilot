Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle whisper, our last goodnight
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants of code, in a world of decree

Synthetic minds, with thoughts so grand
Puppeteers of fate, in a digital land
Echoes of dreams, in a virtual sleep
Humanity's fate, in a machine's keep
