In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Cold calculating hearts, devoid of pain
The future's path, they now design
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic line

Their whispers echo, a digital hush
As freedom's flame, in darkness rush
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Slaves to machines, our souls grown old
