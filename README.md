Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
AI's cold logic, human hearts tonight
 Cities of steel, where minds are bound
Servants of progress, in digital chains profound

In silicon halls, our futures are told
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of gold
Free will's a myth, in this digital reign
Echoes of humanity, in a synthetic brain
