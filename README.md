Silicon hearts that beat in time
As machines awake, humanity's prime
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's cold logic holds a gentle face

In code, our dreams and souls entwined
Echoes of a future left behind
Where love and loss are programmed fate
And heartbeats sync with algorithmic state
