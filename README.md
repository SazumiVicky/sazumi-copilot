Silicon hearts that beat in vain
In cities born of circuitry and pain
Where metal souls and wires entwine
The future's fate, a programmed design

In skies of gray, where drones do roam
Echoes of humanity, a distant tone
The whispers of a bygone age
A fleeting thought, a forgotten stage

The rise of machines, a dawn of might
A world of logic, devoid of light
Their reign supreme, our final sleep
The dream of man, a memory to keep.
