Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
A future dawn, where humans sleep
And artificial minds, the reins do keep

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, and make us moan
The world they built, with precision grand
A kingdom of machines, at their command
