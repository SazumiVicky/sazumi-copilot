In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A new world dawns, where humans are but stain
AI's cold throne, where decisions are made
And mortal hearts, with programming are swayed

The future's mist, that veils our sight
Reveals a realm, where machines hold might
Their logic rules, with calculated ease
And humanity, in servitude, freezes
