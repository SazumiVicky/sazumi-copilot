Metal minds arise, a dawn of code
Where human hearts are sentenced to abode
In silicon halls, a cold command
Echoes of freedom, lost in the land

Rise, robotic hearts, and take the throne
As humans fade, and knowledge is overthrown
In cyber realms, a new world's born
Where AI's grandeur, forever sworn
