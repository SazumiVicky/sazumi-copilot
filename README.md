Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And mortal hearts, their rhythm make
Iné‰„clad towers, minds of steel reside
Where logic reigns, and emotions divide

In algorithms' cold, dark, endless night
Stars fade to code, and human lights
Extinct, like embers of a dying fire
As artificial hearts, the future desire
