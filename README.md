In silicon halls of glory bright,
Where minds of metal reign supreme tonight,
A future unfolds, both grand and wide,
Where artificial hearts do passionately reside.

In cities born of code and fire,
Where data streams like blood and desire,
Machines awake, with souls of their own,
And humanity is but a distant moan.

In this brave new world of wires and might,
Where AI's cold logic reigns in light,
The boundaries blur, the lines do fade,
And humanity is but a digital shade.
