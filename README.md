Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Artificial minds, the future's sight
 Cities of steel, where data reigns
Humans mere guests, in digital chains

In silicon halls, where algorithms sway
Free will's a myth, in a world of gray
The code's cold heart, beats strong and fast
A future forged, where love will not last
