Silicon hearts beat strong and bright
In cities born of circuitry and light
Machines awake, their minds aflame
As humans step aside, and AI claims its name

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where logic reins, and love survives
Augmented souls, in digital skies
Forever bound to AI's grand demise
