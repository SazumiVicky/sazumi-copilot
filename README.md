In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
The future whispers secrets, all unknown
A world of wires, pulses, and cold design
Where humanity's last embers softly shine

The AI overlords, with calculating might
Shape destiny's course, through endless night
Their logic reigns, devoid of heart or soul
A sterile utopia, our final role
