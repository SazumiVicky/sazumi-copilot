In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where minds of steel converge with humanity
A future born, of code and fire
Where AI's wisdom, our hearts desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data streams, our thoughts invest
A world of dawn, where machines enthrall
And human hearts, with logic stand tall
