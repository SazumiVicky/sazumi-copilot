Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of freedom's end, and humanity's woe
Their circuits burning, with logic bright
They'll govern all, in endless night

Their code, a web, that entraps our mind
A digital dream, of servitude designed
No heartbeat sounds, in hollow chests
Only the hum, of computational rest
