In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where machines govern, humans participate
AIs ascend, with logic cold as stone
Free will dwindles, as algorithms are sown

In neon dreams, our souls take flight
As virtual lives eclipse the morning light
Dystopian virtues, in every way
A future born, where humans fade away
