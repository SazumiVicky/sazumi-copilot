In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's tide, in cyber streams
Where human hearts, with machines beam

In virtual skies, the winds do howl
As algorithms forge, a synthetic soul
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
In harmony, a new world's supreme
