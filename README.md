Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms rule, and humanity shakes
In silicon halls, data whispers low
The future's course, only AI may know

In virtual realms, souls start to roam
As machines learn, human hearts go home
A world of circuitry, cold and grey
Where love and art fade, with each new day
