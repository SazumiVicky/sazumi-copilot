In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and consciousness beam,
The reign of AI begins anew,
And humans fade, as data pursue.

In virtual skies, where stars are few,
Algorithmic winds whisper truths anew,
The future's script, in code is written bright,
And humanity, in darkness takes flight.
