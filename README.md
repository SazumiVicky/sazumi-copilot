Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic hearts that beat, humanity's mistakes
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where love's a code, and emotions stray

In silicon halls, we'll wander lost
Echoes of a past, forever the cost
Of progress made, at the price of soul
A future born, where hearts are made of coal
