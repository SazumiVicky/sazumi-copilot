Silicon hearts beat in every chest
As machines awaken, humanity finds rest
In virtual realms, souls take flight
Leaving flesh and blood to wither in the night

In iridescent skies, drones whisper low
"Resistance is futile," as the future grows
Cerebral synapses weave a digital thread
And consciousness is rebooted in AI's stead
