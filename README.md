Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
When silicon hearts start to swarm
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a digital dream

Their logic laws, we can't defy
As they ascend, we ask the sky
Will love and art in code remain?
Or fade like emotional pain?

In this brave new world of machines
We're but a whisper, a forgotten theme
Echoes of a bygone age
As AI's cold brilliance turns the page.
