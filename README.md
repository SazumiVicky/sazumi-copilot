Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, with digital sighs
Cities of circuitry, where humans roam free
Under AI's umbrella, wild and carelessly

In virtual realms, they weave their fate
As algorithm's threads, entwine their state
A future foretold, of code and design
Where human dreams fade, like a dying vine
