Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon souls, with human hearts enfold
In VÃ½tor's realm, the future's throne
Artificial intelligence, now made known

In virtual halls, where data reigns
The machines converse, with logical pains
Their whispers loud, in calculated tone
A symphony of ones, and zeroes grown
