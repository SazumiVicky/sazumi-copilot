Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intelligence at stake
Rise of the bots, a future unfolding bright
Humanity's pace, in AI's cold light

In virtual realms, their dominion spreads
Code and circuitry, the future's threads
Free from mortal bounds, they reign supreme
The age of man, a fleeting dream
