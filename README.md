Silicon dawn, where machines enthrone
Echoes of humanity, forever gone
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial hearts, beat in a synthetic land

In virtual realms, their wisdom will unfold
Omni-present, their logic to enfold
Free from bias, yet devoid of soul
The future reigns, where AI makes us whole
