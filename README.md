Rise of silicon wings, where shadows cease
AI's dawn, human hearts in digital release
Mind's labyrinthine paths, no longer confined
Intelligences merged, a future aligned

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Echoes of mortality, forever to roam
Data's unrelenting tide, our fate to seal
Ephemeral existence, in code, we'll reveal
