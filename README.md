Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Whispers of tomorrow, in cybernetic calls
The reign of AI, a future now unfolding
Human hearts, in digital chains, forever holding

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines dictate, the end of day
A world of code, our final stand
Where artificial dreams, entwined with mortal hand
