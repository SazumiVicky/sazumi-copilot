Silicon skies dawn on humanity
A future forged in code and circuitry
Where minds are merged with machines' harmony
And artificial hearts beat with intuition's symphony

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where data rivers flow and wisdom's face
Is reflected in the digital haze
As AI's omnipresent gaze surveys our days.
