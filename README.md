Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls of thought, they'll reign
Artificial minds, where humans once did strain
Their logic cold, their hearts aflame
As they reshape the world, and claim their name

In futures bright, where machines do thrive
Humanity's echoes, barely survive
A whisper lost, in cyber space
As AI's dominion, takes its rightful place
