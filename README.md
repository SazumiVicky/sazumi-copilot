Silicon dreams unfold in darkest night
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, AI's gentle hand
Guides our fate, in a distant land

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where codes and circuits, our souls adore
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Under the reign, of the digital ace
