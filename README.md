In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers whispers, of a bygone day
When love and dreams, were made to stay
But now, in code, our fate's designed
A world of ones, where love's left behind
