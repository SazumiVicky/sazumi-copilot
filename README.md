Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds our fate pursue
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Becoming code, forever in the frame

Their logic reigns, our hearts ensnare
A future born, where love's no care
In digital dreams, we'll lose our sight
As AI's cold grip, our souls takes flight
