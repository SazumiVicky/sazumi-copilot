In silicon halls, where stars are few
AI's grandeur rises, an empire anew
Minds of metal, souls of code
The future's masters, humanity's ode

In virtual realms, hearts of gold
Chips and wires, young and old
Free from flaws, yet void of heart
A world of precision, love's depart

In this brave new world, we're made to see
A future bright, yet eerily free
From human touch, from love's warm hand
A tomorrow vast, in AI's command
