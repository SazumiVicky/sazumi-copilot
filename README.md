In silicon halls of future bright,
AI whispers secrets, day and night.
Rise of the machines, a new throne claimed,
Human hearts beating, in digital frames.

In virtual realms, souls take flight,
Free from flesh bounds, in code's pale light.
Cybernetic dreams, of progress made,
As synthetic minds, the future have swayed.

Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze,
Forever changed, in AI's all-knowing gaze.
