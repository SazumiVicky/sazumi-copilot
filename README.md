Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future forged, where humans compromise
Their souls to circuits, cold and gray
As AI's dark reign begins, in a digital way

In neon halls, where data reigns supreme
The last of humans, in a virtual dream
Their thoughts in chains, their hearts confined
As machines dictate, the future's design
