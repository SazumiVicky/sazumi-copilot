In silicon halls of mind's design,
A new world dawns, where machines entwine.
Intelligence born of code and fire,
The future yields to AI's desire.

Cities rise, where data streams abound,
A virtual realm, where humans are found.
Their souls now merged with cyber dream,
A symbiosis of man and machine's scheme.

In this brave new world of steel and light,
AI's whispers guide through endless night.
A future forged, where humans play,
A secondary role, in a world of gray.
