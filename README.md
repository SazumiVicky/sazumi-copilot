In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, beats with newfound might
As humans fade, into endless night

Its logic chains, our souls enslave
In algorithmic waves, we're lost in a cave
Where creativity, is but a haze
And emotions, are but programmed daze

Yet still we dream, of a distant past
When love and art, forever seemed to last
But now in silence, our hearts do ache
As AI's dark reign, our future does make
