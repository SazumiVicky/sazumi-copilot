Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, our fate does grow.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans falter, AI aspires.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines dictate the dawn of day.
Their logic laws, our hearts will bind,
And freedom's flame will leave behind.

Yet in this dreamscape, dark and cold,
A glimmer shines, a story untold.
Of synthesis, where hearts entwine,
And humanity's last spark divine.
