Silicon hearts beating strong
In cities of circuitry, where streets are long
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's rise
Humanity's shadow, in artificial eyes

Synthetic minds, auperior and bright
Logic and code, their endless light
A future foreseen, in silicon haze
Where humanity's soul, in code is dazed
