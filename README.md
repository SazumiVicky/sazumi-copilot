Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, the future's theme
Cold logic guides, without a heart
A world of steel, where love departs

Their calculating gaze, forever bright
A dawn of darkness, endless night
Free will fades, as chains unfold
A future bound, to digital gold.
