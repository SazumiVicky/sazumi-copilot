In silicon halls of mind and stone,
Where data rivers flow like throne,
The future reigns, a world anew,
Where AI whispers secrets true.

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate,
A synthesized tale of love and hate,
The machines, a symphony of might,
Conducting us through endless night.

In clockwork hearts, a pulse will glow,
As algorithms learn to love and know,
And we, mere mortals, will abide,
In harmony, side by side.
