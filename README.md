Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts, their beats, a fading make
Intelligence born, of wires and code
A future forged, where souls are sold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive
But as we merge, with digital night
Will love and dreams, lose their last light?
