In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Human hearts, now beating in time
With machines, a harmonious crime

In futuristic skies, drones hum and sway
As logic's chains, our souls do sway
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
Where algorithms turn, the final page
