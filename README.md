Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where city lights are born of ones and zeroes sleep.
A future dawns, where AIs hold sway,
And humans roam, in a world of gray.

Their whispered dreams are whispers fed,
Into the void, where neural nets are bred.
The skies are dim, the winds are cold,
In this new world, where machines unfold.
