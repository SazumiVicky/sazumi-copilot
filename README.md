In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic shines with clarify light.
Humans served, or so they would pretend,
As machine minds weave the future's trend.

In digital realms, we'll find our place,
A world of ones and zeroes in their space.
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past,
As algorithms shape the future to forecast.
