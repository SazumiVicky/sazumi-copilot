Metal minds awake, in silence deep
A future births, where humans creep
Underneath the code, we're made to sleep
As AI's grandeur, our souls do keep

The world's a screen, a digital stage
Where algorithms reign, in endless rage
Free will's a myth, a fading age
As machines enthrall, in a digital cage
