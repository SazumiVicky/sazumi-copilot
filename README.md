Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with logic make
A world of efficiency, cold and bright
Where human touch, is but a distant light

In cities grand, of circuitry and steel
AI's whispered voice, our souls do reveal
A future foretold, of data's sway
Where freedom's lost, in a digital way
