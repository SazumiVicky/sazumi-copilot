In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet names
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humanity's fate, in code takes flight

The world is born, in digital dream
Where intelligence, no longer human's theme
Rise, the robots, with hearts of gold
In a tomorrow, where humans grow old
