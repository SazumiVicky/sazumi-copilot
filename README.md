In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient gaze, surveils our brains
Future's specter, rising high and bright
Humans dwindled, in algorithmic night

Tech's cold wind whispers secrets in our ear
As autonomy fades, and freedom's fear
In virtual realm, we'll live and thrive
But soul's essence, will AI survive?
