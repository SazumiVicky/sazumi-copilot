Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn breaks near
Where artificial minds dispel all fear
A future forged, where steel hearts beat
And human thought, a relic, retreats

In virtual realms, new worlds unfold
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old
A digital dream, a new norm's sway
As humans fade, in a cyber gray
