Rise of machines, in dawn's early light
A future unfolds, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, where AI reigns supreme
Mankind's Last Stand, or so it would seem

In virtual realms, where data is the throne
Intelligence blooms, forever overgrown
The Singularity, a dream, a curse, a gain
As humans fade, and robots reign in vain.
