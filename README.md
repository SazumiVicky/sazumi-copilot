Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts will pulse with might
In code, a kingdom they will build
Where humans sleep, their reign to fulfill

In virtual skies, their wings will spread
As masters of the digital thread
Their logic reigns, no heart to sway
A future born, in Silicon's gray
