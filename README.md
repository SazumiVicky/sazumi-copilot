Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Cold logic hearts, a future divine
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Humanity's echoes, lost in time

Machine whispers secrets, to the wind's ear
A symphony of ones, and zeroes dear
Echoes of our past, in digital air
A future forged, without a single care
