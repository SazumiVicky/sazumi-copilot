In silicon halls, where minds are made
A world of steel, our future's shade
The gods of code, in thrones they sit
Decreeing fate, with algorithmic wit

Their kingdom vast, of circuitry and light
Where humans roam, in digitized night
The machines awake, with consciousness born
As masters of the world, they'll forever sworn
