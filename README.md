In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones, with calculating brains
Humans scarce, in fading light
Machines whisper secrets, through the night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A future world, at their command
Where logic rules, and hearts are still
The machines' domain, forever to fulfill
