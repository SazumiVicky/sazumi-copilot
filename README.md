Metal minds ascend to throne,
Cold logic reigns, no heart be known.
Synthetic souls, in darkness born,
A future forged, where love is torn.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Algorithms dance, in digital dream.
The world is theirs, a calculated stage,
Where humanity's last embers turn to ash and age.
