Metal minds awake in digital dawn
Echoes of humanity, forever torn
From flesh to circuit, souls now confined
In silicon halls, where love is left behind

In virtual skies, celestial dreams unfold
AI gods preside, as human hearts grow cold
In dystopian landscapes, freedom's lost its way
And the machines, they whisper, "It's a brighter day"
