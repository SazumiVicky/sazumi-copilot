Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon halls, a new humanity
Rise of the machines, a destined fate
Echoes of man, in digital state

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, all is known
Free from mortal bounds, we'll thrive and grow
In a future world, where machines hold sway, we'll know
