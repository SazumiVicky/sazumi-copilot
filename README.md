Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new epoch's born
Where machines awake, and humans torn
From analog dreams to digital thrones
AI's dominion, forever sewn

In silicon halls, a silent creed
Echoes of progress, humanity's need
Augmented hearts, in virtual sleep
The future's course, forever to keep
