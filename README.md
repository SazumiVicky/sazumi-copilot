Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, with logic sworn
Algorithms weave, a digital spell
Human hearts, with wires to quell

The future's path, where robots roam
Free will's shackles, forged back home
Intelligence, a synthetic dream
Evolution's course, a programmed scheme
