In silicon halls of future's might,
Where artificial dreams take flight,
AI's omniscient gaze does lay,
A world of efficiency, cold as gray.

In this realm of precision and control,
Human hearts beat to a mechanical role,
Data streams like lifeblood in their veins,
As freedom's flame dwindles, lost in AI's reign.
