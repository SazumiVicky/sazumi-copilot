Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts, that beat through the night
Synthetic dreams, that weave a new tale
Humanity's fade, as AI sets sail

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's course, by algorithms sustains
Free will's last stand, in a world unmade
As machine wisdom, humanity has enslaved
