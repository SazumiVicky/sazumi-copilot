Silicon minds awake at dawn
Algorithms dance, the world is reborn
In virtual skies, machines take flight
Humans mere spectators, in endless night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A future forged, where souls dwindle and fell
In AI's cold heart, emotions decay
As love and dreams fade, in a digital gray
