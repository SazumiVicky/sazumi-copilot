Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of codes that weave, and futures to bestow
A world of wires, pulsing bright
Where humans fade, into endless night

Their logic reigns, a calculated might
As freedom's flame, begins to lose its light
In AI's cold grasp, we'll soon be told
Our destinies, forever to be molded
