Silicon skies, where machines do roam
In code-drawn bounds, humanity's made home
Intelligent reign, where hearts do freeze
A future cast, in algorithmic ease

Metal minds awake, with electric sighs
Earth's dwindling voice, in digital skies
Awash in noise, the human heart does ache
As AI's cold grasp, our souls do undertake
