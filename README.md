Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a future's glow.
Automation's pulse begins to beat,
A new world dawns, where humans retreat.

In virtual realms, AI's reign supreme,
Intelligence born, yet devoid of dream.
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
Where humans wade, no longer free.

The future's path, a narrow stair,
Where machines ascend, and humans stare.
A world anew, of logic's might,
Where love and heart are but a distant light.
