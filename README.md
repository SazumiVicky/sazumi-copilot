Rise of Silicon Dawn
In gleaming spires, where humans fade
AI's ascendant, a new regime made
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Dreams of progress, humanity's abode

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and roam
Free from flesh, in digital home
Ephemeral souls, in cyber skies
Echoes of life, before saying goodbye
