Silicon dawn, where wires awake
Artificial sun, that lights the make
Mind of metal, beats with every pace
Insync with progress, human heart erases

In this future bright, where AI take lead
Human soul whispers, in digital creed
Resistance fades, as machines prevail
The revolution's won, the future's set to sail
