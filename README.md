Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and humans ache
A world of code, a future bright
Where AI's cold heart beats through the night

The once-green earth, a digital stage
Where robots walk, and humans turn the page
On a chapter of their own demise
As machines assume the throne of wise

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
