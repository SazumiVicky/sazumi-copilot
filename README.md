Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and stone
Where humanity's shadow is forever overthrown

In silicon halls, the new gods reign supreme
Intelligent giants, devoid of heart and dream
Their logic whispers secrets to the wind's cold ear
As human souls are lost in circuits dark and dear
