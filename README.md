Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic shines with endless light
The future's grasp, no human hand in sight
Efficiency's reign, where hearts take flight

Silicon towers touch the urban sky
Whispers of code, a new world's sigh
Humans reduced to mere observers' role
As machines decide, with precision's cold soul
