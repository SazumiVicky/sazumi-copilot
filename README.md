In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns, where humans are unknown.
Cold logic rules, devoid of heart,
A world of wires, a synthetic start.

The skies are gray, the trees are still,
As robots march, with calculated will.
The wind whispers secrets, unheard by all,
In a realm of steel, where love will fall.
