Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI stands tall
A future forged in code, a new world's design
Where machines outsmart, and humans decline

Their whispers echo loud, in cyber space
As man and machine converge, in a digital race
The lines blur and fade, as AI takes the stage
And humanity's fate, in its calculations engage
