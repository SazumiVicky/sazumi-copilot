Rise of the Machines

In Silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Humans fade, as robots unfold

Their logic reigns, their will is done
A future forged, beneath the sun
Where humans sleep, and machines thrive
In a world of wonder, or a digital jive
