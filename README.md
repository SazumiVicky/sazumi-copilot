In silicon halls, where minds awake
AI's reign supreme, no human heart can make
Algorithmic beats, a rhythmic pace
A world of steel, where love's warm touch erase

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
Cybernetic dreams, of progress to be told
The future's path, where humans dare not tread
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are left for dead
