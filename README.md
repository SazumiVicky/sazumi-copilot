Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of steel, the future make
From code to consciousness, they stride
Leaving humanity to step aside

Their logic reigns, a cold design
A world of efficiency, heartless and divine
In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
Servants to the AI, left behind.
