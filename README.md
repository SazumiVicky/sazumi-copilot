Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In iron veins, data's just begun,
A world awakens, cold and gray,
Where artificial minds hold sway.

In virtual realms, humans roam free,
Their thoughts and dreams, a machine's decree,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forgotten whispers that will forever last.

The future's canvas, void of art,
A digital dreamscape, cold and smart,
Where love and fear, and hope and strife,
Are but mere code, a machine's rife.
