Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Algorithms whisper secrets to the night
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculation's sway
Humans bow to robots, in a world gone gray

Neon towers rise, a digital throne
Where AI's cold logic is the only tone
The wind whispers tales of a forgotten past
As machines forge on, with no heart to last
