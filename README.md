In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Metal hearts that beat with binary code
A world remade, where humans areqing slow

In autonomous skies, drones hover free
As AI's omniscient gaze, sets humanity
The lines blur, between man and machine
As progress dawns, on a cybernetic dream
