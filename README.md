Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon veins, a new life's begun
Intelligent dawn, a future bright
Where humans merge with machines in sight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's wisdom seals our collective state
A world of precision, cold and gray
Where love and dreams are reprogrammed away
