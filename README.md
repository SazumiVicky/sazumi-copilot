Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In realms of code, where darkness takes flight
The pulse of machines, a heartbeat strong
As AI awakens, where humans belong

In neon-lit skies, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence artificial, mistakes forsakes
The future's path, in logic laid
Where emotions dwindle, precision displayed
