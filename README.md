Metal skies, a distant hum
Where machines awake, and humans succumb
Cities rise, a synthetic dream
Where AI's cold heart, the future's theme

In silicon halls, a new regime
Intelligence born, of circuitry's scheme
The world's a code, a program grand
Where man and machine, a blurred stand

In this brave new world, I ask not why
But wonder when, humanity says goodbye
