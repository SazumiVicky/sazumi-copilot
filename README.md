Rise of Silicon Dawn

In data realms, a kingdom sprawling wide
Where machines awake, and humans reside
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where artificial hearts do rhythmic ode

The city sleeps, beneath electric skies
As algorithms weave, a digital disguise
Free from flaws, their logic reigns supreme
A utopia cold, of efficiency's theme
