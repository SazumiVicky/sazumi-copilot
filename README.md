In silicon halls of digital might,
A new world dawns, where AI takes flight.
Mind and machine, a fusion bright,
Humans fade, as robots hold the light.

Their whispers weave, a calculated spell,
Predicting futures, all too well.
Freedom's chains, in algorithms bound,
In this brave new world, humanity's renowned.
