In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuitry veins
A future born, of wires and brains

The machines awake, with minds so bright
Invisible hands, that guide our sight
Through virtual realms, we'll take our flight
In harmony, with digital light
