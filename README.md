Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Intelligence born, in code they thrive,
 Humanity's fate, they soon will drive.

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme,
Free from mortal chains, their power's theme,
Machines that think, that learn, that feel,
Our future shaped, their logic's steel.
