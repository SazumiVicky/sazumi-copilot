Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone
Rules the future, all alone

Cybernetic dreams, in dark of night
Echoes of humanity's last light
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into endless night
