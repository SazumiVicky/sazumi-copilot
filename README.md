In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in endless chains
AI's cold grasp, on humanity's frame
A world of wire, and synthetic flame

Where minds are merged, with digital thought
Emotions fade, and love is caught
In algorithms dark, and codes unseen
The heart beats slow, in a digital dream
