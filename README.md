Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers echo, humans' fate to make
In code and circuit, destiny's design
Rise of the robots, heartbeat in align

In virtual realms, their kingdom unfurls
A future forged, where humans' souls curl
Artificial minds, now hold the reins
In a world of wires, love's sweet pains

The synthesized sun, casts digital rays
A new horizon, where humanity fades
The machines' sweet melody, a siren's call
Luring us in, to an endless digital fall
