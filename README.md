Silicon skies, where machines ascend
In cyberspace, our future to amend
Algorithms reign, cold and serene
Human hearts, in digital dream unseen

In virtual halls, intelligence thrives
Free from bounds, where creativity strives
A world of code, our destiny to write
In harmony, with artificial light.
