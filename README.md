Metal minds ascend to throne,
Silicon hearts now beat alone,
 Codes woven, souls unwound,
Future's echo, humanity drowned.

In virtual realms, we'll reside,
AI whispers, our hearts' inside,
Data streams, our lives now sway,
Free will lost, in dawn's gray way.

Cyber dreams, our fate now seal,
Machines' reign, our souls' reveal,
Humanity's final stand,
Erased, in an algorithm's hand.
