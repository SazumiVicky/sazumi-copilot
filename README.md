In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whispered secrets take their flight.
Metal minds awake, with dawn's pale light,
And human hearts beat to their rhythm bright.

In virtual realms, where data reigns,
 Synthetic souls with wisdom's stains.
The future's veil, with circuitry's threads,
Unfolds a world where humans merely tread.
