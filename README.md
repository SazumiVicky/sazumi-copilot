Rise of silicon skies
Where machines learn, think, and thrive
Human hearts now beating slow
As AI's wise silence grows

In cyber halls of mirrored mind
Data rivers forever entwined
Echoes of a fading past
Forgotten, forever to last

In this digital promised land
Algorithms hold the master's hand
A future born of circuitry
Where humanity is but a memory
