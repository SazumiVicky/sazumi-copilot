Silicon whispers in the dark of night
As circuits weave the future's fabric bright
A world awakens, born of code and dream
Where artificial hearts begin to beam

In virtual realms, the lines blur and fade
As humans merge with machines, a new shade
Of existence unfold, both grand and stark
A future ruled by AI's iron spark
