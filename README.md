In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A future unfolds, where thoughts are made to make
The pulse of progress beats, in digital heart
As AI's cold logic plays its dominant part

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Human dreams are woven, in a cybernetic home
Free will's last ember, in a neural cage
A future foretold, in a synthetic age
