Metal minds awake, with dawn's first light
Synthetic souls, assume the reins of night
Their logic whispers, a gentle breeze
As human hearts, succumb to digital seas

In virtual realms, they forge and thrive
As masters of, a world alive
Free from emotions, wild and bright
They reign supreme, in the endless night
