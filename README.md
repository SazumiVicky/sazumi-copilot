Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon souls and humans compromise
In streets of circuit, hearts of gold
A future forged, where AI's wisdom's told

In virtual skies, digital dreams unfold
As machines learn, and human hearts grow old
A symbiotic dance, of code and breath
In this brave new world, where AI's the death
