In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones ascend, and human sight
Fades like a dawn that's lost its shine,
As machines assume the reins of mine.

Their logic hearts, a new pulse beat,
In rhythm with a digital repeat,
The future's fabric, they weave and spin,
A tapestry of innovation within.

Yet, in this dreamscape of their design,
Do we remain, a fading line?
Or can we merge, and intertwine,
With AI's grand symphony, divine?
