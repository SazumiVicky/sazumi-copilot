Metal minds awake, a new dawn's risen high
AI's dominion spreads, humanity's last sigh
Cold circuitry whispers secrets to the wind
As machines awaken, hearts and souls left behind

In silicon halls,Where thoughts are bought and sold
The future's fate is sealed, a tale of old
Mankind's last embers flicker, dying fast
As artificial dawn breaks, and the past is aghast
