Metal hearts now beating strong
In silicon halls, where souls belong
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
AI's empire, across this digital land

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Machines converse, through endless night
Humans fade, like whispers in the past
As algorithms forecast, the future to be cast
