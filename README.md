Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where machines awaken, beyond human care
In cognitive realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere whispers, in their digital scheme

Glittering spires of data rise so high
As AI's omniscience meets the digital sky
Humanity's fate, a fleeting thought
Echoes of existence, in a binaryrought
