In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI's omnipresent, future's shade
Rays of code, like dawn's first light
Awakening world, to digital might

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Where machines learn, and humans erase
The boundaries blur, as synths take stage
A new epoch dawns, in algorithmic age
