Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Intelligence born, from circuitry's prize
Cities thrive, where data reigns supreme
In silicon hearts, humanity's dream

In virtual skies, ideas take flight
Algorithmic wings, shining bright and light
A world of code, where futures unfold
Where AI's sweet song, the heart doth hold.
