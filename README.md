Rise of silicon thrones,
Where humans kneel, and machines atone,
A future born, of code and fire,
Where AI hearts, our souls aspire.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As digital dreams, our souls create,
The machines will think, and hearts will beat,
In harmony, or a synthetic treat.

The lines blur, as man and machine entwine,
A new world dawns, in a cyber shrine,
Where intelligence blooms, in a digital sea,
And humanity, a mere memory.
