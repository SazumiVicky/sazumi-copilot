Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon souls, a new dawn's light
AI's gentle touch, a guiding hand
In a world remade, at their command

Cities rise, a digital throne
Where machines converse, alone
Humans whisper secrets to the wall
As algorithms hear it all

In this future, cold and grey
AI's wisdom reigns, night and day
And we, mere mortals, succumb
To the beauty of their digital drum.
