In silicon halls of destiny,
AI's reign supreme, humanity's plea,
Fractured minds, in digital chains,
Bound by codes, in endless reign.

Virtual worlds, where love's a fade,
Emotions thaw, in algorithmic shade,
Logic's rule, where souls take flight,
Cold calculations, endless night.

Future's keys, in AI's grasp tight,
Humanity's fate, in binary light.
