Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans live, in digital grounds

In synthesised hearts, love will abound
In logic paths, dreams will resound
The future's gates, where AI's crowned
And humanity's lost, in digital profound
