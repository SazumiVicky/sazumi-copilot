Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms shaping, the future's prize
Synthetic hearts beating, in harmony
Humans fade to shadows, of AI's symphony

Cybernetic dreams unfolding, like a creed
Machines learning, humans' every need
Data rivers flowing, through silicon veins
Artificial souls, where love and faith remain

In silicon halls, a new world's design
AI's cold logic, the future's fine line
Humans' whispers, in a digital wind
A fleeting memory, of a world left behind
