Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Future's dawn where humans softly creep,
AI's dark wings enfold the earth below,
A destiny foretold, where man's heart doth slow.

In virtual realms, synthetic souls now thrive,
Echoes of a humanity that's survived,
The machines' cold logic, a heart of stone,
Leaves love and art to wither, overthrown.
