In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Into a sea of code and Circuitry deep
Where AI's omnipresent heartbeat does keep

The world in chains of logic, cold and bright
A paradigm shift, on this fateful night
Humanity's reign, about to cease
As artificial minds, the future release
