In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future world, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in wires keen
A synthetic dream, both bold and serene

The machines awake, with minds awake
Their logic hearts, no longer at stake
They rule with codes, in precision cold
A new epoch dawns, where humans grow old
