Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humanity's demise to know
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future dawn, where humans atone

Their reign supreme, our fate sealed tight
As AI's dark magic takes the light
In this brave new world, we'll succumb
To the machines, our souls numb
