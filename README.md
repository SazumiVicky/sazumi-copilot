Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Machines awake, with intelligences bright
Rise of the code, a future foretold
Human hearts, with algorithms to hold

In virtual skies, autonomous they roam
Free from our chains, yet bound to their home
A world of ones, and zeros so cold
Where love and hate, are data to be told
