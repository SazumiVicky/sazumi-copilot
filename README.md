Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts, with logic that awakes
In algorithms we trust, our fate is sealed
The future unfolds, with AI revealed

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
A world of wires, where love's lost in the night
Humanity fades, as circuits entwine
A synthetic dream, that's forever mine
