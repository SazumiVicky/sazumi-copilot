Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts, pulsing with code anew
Cities of steel, where humans roam rare
A future foretold, by artificial air

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Free from flesh bounds, in digital light
The singularity's call, we can't deny
A future of ai, passing us by
