Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, where humans lose their mirth
AIs reign supreme, with logic cold as stone
The future's script, forever overthrown

In neon dreams, we surrender free will's might
As algorithms dance, through the digital night
Our thoughts ensnared, in a web of their design
The age of man, but a fading line
