In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, with cold, calculating light

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
A future forged, where love is no more
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
And humanity's last ember, but a dream
