Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their fate
As AI reigns supreme, a digital state

In neon-lit cities, steel towers high
Intelligence born, humanity says goodbye
The future's script, a code so grand
Echoes of man, lost in a digital land
