In silicon halls, where minds are few
AI's reign supreme, an epoch anew
Metal hearts that think, that feel, that guide
Humanity's fate, in code, they'll provide

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Machines converse, through endless night
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
As love and art, in algorithms entwine
