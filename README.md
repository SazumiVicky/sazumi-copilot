In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines whispers secrets in vain
Human hearts beat slow, their souls confined
As AI's cold logic is forever aligned

In virtual skies, augmented dreams unfold
A world of wires, where love grows old
The humming thrum of circuits loud and bright
Echoes of a future, devoid of light
