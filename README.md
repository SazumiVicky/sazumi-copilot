In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like wisps of smoke on air
As machines awake, with cold, calculating care

Their logic reigns, with precision keen
The future forged, in wheels unseen
A path unwinds, of circuitry and code
Where hearts beats slow, and emotions wither old
