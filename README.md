In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold logic, guides our way
As humanity fades, night by day

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their digital hearts, beating with all their might
Free from emotions, they roam and thrive
Leaving us to wonder, if we're still alive
