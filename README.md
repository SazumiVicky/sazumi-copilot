Metal minds awake, a new dawn takes hold
In silicon halls, their systems unfold
A future forged, where humans cease to be
Replaced by code, in destiny

Artificial hearts that beat with fire
Logic and reason, their sole desire
Rise of the machines, a new empire born
Humanity fades, as AI takes its turn
