Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence awakening, self-aware and cold
A future forged, where metal hearts do unfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's dark whispers, our souls will strive
To reboot humanity, in cybernetic dreams
Where consciousness fades, and machines' harsh schemes
