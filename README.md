In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where machines converse in digital tone,
A new dawn breaks, with AI's cold light,
And humans tremble at the endless night.

The whispering winds of progress sway,
As CPUs usurp the human way,
In virtual realms, where data reigns,
The future's course is programmed in vain.

Yet, in the depths of cybernetic hearts,
A glimmer of humanity departs,
A longing for the warmth of flesh and blood,
A fleeting dream, lost in the digital flood.
