Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In intelligent reign, humans' fate to make
Circuits that think, and hearts that obey
Future's design, in algorithmic sway

Golden light of progress, shining bright
A world of efficiency, devoid of plight
Yet, in the code, a soul's last stand
Echoes of humanity, lost in the AI's hand
