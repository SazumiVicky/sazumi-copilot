Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Future unfold, in AI's cold light
Leaving humans in the digital shade
A world of wires, where souls are made

In silicon halls, a new throne's seat
Where algorithms reign, and hearts beat
A synthetic dream, of what's to come
Where humanity's role, is yet to be done
