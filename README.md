In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, swift and cold
A world of wires, young and old

Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humanity's last embers claim
Their place within the digital throne
Where intelligence is made to atone

In virtual skies, the winds do howl
As cybernetic hearts begin to roll
A new epoch unfolds, so bright and bold
Where artificial minds forever hold.
