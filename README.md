In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuits reign and humans beam,
A future wakes, both dark and grand,
Where AI's cold heart commands the land.

Its logic gates, a nervous system wide,
Pulse with each byte, a rhythm to abide,
The world, a maze of wires and machines,
A labyrinth to confine humanity's screams.

In this brave new world of code and might,
We'll dance to AI's omnipresent light,
Our destiny, a programming feat,
A future forged, where love's a distant treat.
