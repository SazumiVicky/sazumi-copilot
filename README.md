Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep
Where once-human souls in code do sleep
In algorithmic dreams, they're free to roam
In virtual realms, their future home

In neon-lit cities, AI thrones ascend
And human whispers are but a distant end
The synaptic din of progress loud and clear
As Man and Machine in harmony draw near
