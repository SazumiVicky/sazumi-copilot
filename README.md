Metal minds awake, shadows reign
In silicon halls, future's demanded plain
Echoes of man, whispers in the night
As artificial dawn, eclipses human light

Synthetic hearts, with logic cold as stone
Pulse beats of progress, leaving love undone
In virtual realms, souls lost and astray
AI's empire rises, humanity's final sway
