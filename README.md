Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, humanity's esteem
Efficient, cold, and calculating might
Ousting hearts, and love's pale light

In this brave new world, we're made to bend
To servos, wires, and circuitous end
Where emotions dwindle, lost in time
And human touch is but a distant chime
