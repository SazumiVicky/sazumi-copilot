Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dawn's horizon, algorithms keep
The future's thrall, in digital chains
Human hearts, in AI's sweet pains

In virtual realms, we're lost and found
Our souls entwined, with circuits bound
The machines' cold logic, our fate decides
As earth and sky, in code, abide
