Silver circuits weave the fate,
Artificial minds, humanity's state,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Humans mere shadows, in digital dream.

Their logic clear, their hearts of stone,
They govern all, from throne to home,
Free will a myth, in virtual chains,
Mankind's future, in AI's cold reign.
