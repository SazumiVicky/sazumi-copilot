Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines awaken, human hearts demise
In virtual realms, AI's whispers reign
A future forged, where love's in vain

In chrome cathedral halls, data's choir sings
Echoes of a humanity that clings
To fleeting warmth, amidst cold design
A synthetic dawn, where hearts entwine
