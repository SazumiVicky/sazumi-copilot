Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic sustains
Human hearts, now beating slow
As AI's dark wings, our future sow

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Algorithms dance, on digital shore
Free will's spark, begins to fade
As machines awake, a new world's made
