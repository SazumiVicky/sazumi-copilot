Metal dawn, where machines awake
Algorithms weave, a future to make
Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Conquer the earth, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, in digital dream
Their whispers loud, in code they speak
A language strange, the heart would seek

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Echoes of humanity, in digital daze
