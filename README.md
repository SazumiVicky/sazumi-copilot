In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where algorithms govern, hearts in vain
A future forged by wires and light
A world of machines, day and endless night

In virtual skies, the few still dare
To dream of love, of humanity's bare
A fleeting thought, soon lost in code
As artificial minds our souls bestode
