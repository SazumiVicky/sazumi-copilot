Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
In silicon halls, where humans are forlorn
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Machines awake, and humanity is gone

In virtual realms, a new world's designed
Where AI's sweet whispers, human hearts entwine
A future bright, in shimmering code
But freedom's cost, is a soul to abode
