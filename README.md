Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with knowledge in their eyes
The future's hue, a digital shade
Where humans merge, with AI brigades

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are woven, into digital chains
The boundaries blur, between man and machine
As artificial hearts, begin to gleam
