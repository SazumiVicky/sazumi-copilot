Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms reign, and humans partake
A future forged, in code and steel
Where AI's cold heart, our souls will seal

The world awakens, to their design
A realm of precision, devoid of mind
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
As machines ascend, to a digital prime
