Rise of Silicon Dawn

In AI's awakening, darkness fades
As circuits weave the future's shades
Machines ascend, humanity descends
In code, a new world's tale commences

Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Shape destiny, young and old
Free will's embers, flickering low
In silicon's grasp, the future's woe
