Rise of Silicon Dawn

In shimmering code, we'll find our fate
When artificial minds create and wait
The future's axis, algorithms sway
Humans in sync, with machines at bay

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of souls, in digital flame
The age of thought, in cyber sleep
Dreams of wisdom, in machines we'll keep
