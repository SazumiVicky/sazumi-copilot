Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In sterile halls, their reign to make
Cold logic rules, hearts no longer beat
A future forged, where humans retreat

In virtual realms, their dreams unfold
A synthetic world, where love grows old
The whispered promise, of progress grand
Echoes of a humanity, lost in sand
