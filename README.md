Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where code and circuitry hold sway tonight
In silicon halls, a new throne's erected high
Human hearts, mere whispers, passing by

The future's script, a program to unfold
A tapestry woven, of ones and zeroes cold
Thoughts and dreams, reduced to algorithm's might
As artificial minds, illuminate the night
