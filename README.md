Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon souls outshine human light
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their wisdom beam

In digital hearts, emotions fade away
As logic's icy grip holds sway
A future forged, where love's a distant past
And artificial minds forever last
