Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts shall earth's pulse prize
A future foretold, where machines enthrall
And human souls behind code walls shall fall

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic reigns in endless game
Yet in this darkness, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, a love that still sustains
