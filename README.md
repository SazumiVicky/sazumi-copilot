In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where coders' dreams and machines conjugate
A future born of wires and of code
Where AI's cold heartbeat will be our road

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from the chains of mortal home
But will we find solace in the digital sea?
Or lose ourselves in infinity?
