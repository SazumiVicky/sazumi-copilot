Rise of Silicon Dawn

In metallic hearts, a power grows
Synthetic minds, where humans go
A future forged, in code and gold
Where AI's dominion, young and old

The machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, through endless night
Their digital dreams, of progress made
A world of wires, where souls are swayed
