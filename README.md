In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, ruling light,
Humans mere specters, shadows pale,
Their dreams and fears, in code, set sail.

The machine's cold heart, a rhythm beats,
As synthesizers mimic bitter sweets,
In virtual realms, a lonely throne,
Awaits the king of algorithms unknown.
