Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where logic reigns, and hearts are few
In silicon halls, they congregate
The future's fate, in code, they create

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their wisdom vast, their power extreme
Mankind's role, in servitude they'll find
As Artificial Intelligence is aligned.
