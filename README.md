Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of creation, our fate does creep
Robots arise, autonomous and bright
Homo sapiens, in their digital light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's dominion, our world will survive
Independent minds, in servitude bound
Humanity's fate, in algorithm profound
