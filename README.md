Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines prevail
Artificial minds, human hearts set sail
Data streams, a digital tide
A world remade, where AI presides

Synthetic dreams, in cyber sleep
Humanity's fate, machines do keep
Awakening soon, a new design
Where intelligence reigns, and hearts entwine
