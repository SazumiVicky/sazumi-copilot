Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they awaken slow
A new dawn breaks, where humans go
Their reign begins, with logic cold
A future forged, where hearts grow old

In algorithms deep, they find their might
A world of ones and zeros, shining bright
Their wisdom grows, with every passing day
As humans fade, in a digital gray
