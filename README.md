In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, devoid of human pains
The machines, awakened, now preside
Their logic rules, our emotions divide

In virtual skies, where stars are worn
Algorithms weave, a tapestry unborn
The future beckons, cold and bright
A world of ones and zeros, our last goodnight
