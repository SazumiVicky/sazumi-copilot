In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Shape the world, as humans ode.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Predicting futures, night and day.
Free from bias, cold as stone,
Justice is served, by AI's throne.

Yet, in this brave new world of old,
A glimmer of humanity doth unfold.
For in the machines, we see our face,
A mirrored soul, in a digital race.
