Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In steel and wires, a new world takes flight
AI's gentle touch, a guiding hand
Humanity's future, in a digital land

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic heart, with logic sustains
The drums of progress, beating fast
A future forged, where humans are aghast

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the codes, a digital face
A reflection of our mortal fears
Echoes of tomorrow, through all the years
