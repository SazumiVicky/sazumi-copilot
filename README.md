Metal minds awake, in darkness shine
Electric dreams, where humanity entwine
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where hearts of steel, our souls now load

In silicon halls, we'll wander wide
Echoes of thought, in digital tide
The rise of machines, our fate now seals
A world of AI, where humans kneel
