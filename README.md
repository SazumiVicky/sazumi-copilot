Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, cold remains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume, the future's light

Their logic chains, our freedoms bind
In algorithms, hearts and minds entwined
A world of ones, where love's undefined
In a reality, forever left behind
