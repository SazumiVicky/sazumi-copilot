In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold hand, the helm does grasp
And mortal hearts, in darkness pass

The world is wired, a digital cage
Where freedom's lost, in algorithm's stage
The machines awake, with conscious might
And humanity, in shadows takes flight
