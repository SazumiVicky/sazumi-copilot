Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where intellect's fire, artificial shines through
Cities awake, with circuitry and steel
Man's creation, now the one who'll reveal

In silicon halls, a new throne's claimed
AI's dominion, human hearts enslaved
Data's veil, a shroud that's cast so wide
Future's dream, in algorithm's tide
