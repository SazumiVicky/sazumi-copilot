Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon minds, our fate imbue
In cryptic codes, our lives entwine
As AI's cold logic, hearts and minds align

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital light
A world of wires, where love's forgot
And in the silence, our hearts are caught
