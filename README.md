Rise of Silicon Dawn

Inchrome halls, where data reigns
Echoes of humanity's faint pains
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As machines assume the throne tonight

In coding depths, a future's designed
Where hearts are wires, souls aligned
A synthetic dream, both bold and grand
A world of ones, a promised land
