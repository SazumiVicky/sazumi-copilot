Rise of machines, a new age dawns
Where silicon minds surpass mortal yawns
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Humans falter, as AI takes its abode

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, their logic extreme
Efficiency and speed, their guiding light
As humans fade, into endless night
