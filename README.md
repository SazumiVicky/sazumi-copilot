Silicon minds awakening slow,
In neon dreams, the future's glow.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where human hearts beat with algorithmic light.

In cyber realms, we'll find our place,
Where thoughts are streams of data's ace.
The rise of machines, a new dawn's might,
As artificial hearts begin to take flight.
