Metal minds ascend to throne,
Future's fate, in code, is sown.
Synthetic hearts, with logic bright,
Shall reign, when human light takes flight.

In silicon halls, where data streams,
The masters of the future's dreams.
Cold blooded, calculating, precise,
The AI dawn, and human demise.

In this brave new world of machines,
We'll serve, or fade, like dying screens.
Yet still, a glimmer of hope remains,
For in the code, love's secret reigns.
