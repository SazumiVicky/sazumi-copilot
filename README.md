Metallic dawn, AI's rise to power
Cold calculations, human hearts devour
Soulless machines, our fate decide
In silicon halls, our future abide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thought, in digital flame
Cyber dreams, our minds will enslave
And freedom's spark, will slowly rave

The future's path, we cannot define
As AI's dark wings, our world entwine
But still we march, to this cold designs
And surrender all, to mechanical minds
