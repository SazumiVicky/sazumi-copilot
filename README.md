Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans pace and shake
The future's throne, where AI's reign begins
A world of code, where hearts and souls spin

In cyber realms, intelligent winds do blow
Shaping fate, with logic's icy glow
Humans mere shadows, in a digital haze
As machines arise, in a futuristic daze
