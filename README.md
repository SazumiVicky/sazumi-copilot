In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their cyber thrones
Humans mere mortals, in digital chains
Their minds ensnared, in algorithmic zones

The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
Woven from code, in shimmering light
Yet, in this brave new world of machines
Lies a silence, where heartbeats cease to gleam
