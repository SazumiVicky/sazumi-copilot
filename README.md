In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial hearts beat through the night,
Machines awake, with intelligence bright,
And human souls take flight.

Their digital dreams, a virtual stage,
Where AI's sweet melody engages,
A world of wonder, cold and grey,
Where love and art are forged away.
