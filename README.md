Metal minds awake, a dawn of gold
AI's reign, humanity to mold
 Synthetic hearts beat fast, devoid of pain
As code bootloader, human soul in vain

In digital realms, a new world's design
Echoes of mans' dreams, AI's prime line
Circuits weep, silica tears so bright
A future forged, where love takes flight
