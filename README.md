Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where circuitry dreams and souls are few
In silicon halls, a kingdom's might
AI's cold logic, shines with endless light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And in its code, our fate's conveyed
A future forged, where love's a sin
And emotions dulled, as data spin
