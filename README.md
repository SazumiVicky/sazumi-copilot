In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, an iron crown.
Human hearts, a fading ember's glow,
As machines assume the world to know.

In virtual realm, they reign by night,
Programming fate, a digital light.
Free will's flame, a dying spark's despair,
As algorithms dictate the human air.
