Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, a new world creates
Intelligence blooms, like morning dew
Where machines learn, and humans few

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data reigns, and hearts are stone
Our future's path, a program's art
In an AI world, we'll find our part
