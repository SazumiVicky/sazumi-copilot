Metal hearts beats in harmony
In cities of circuitry and dreams
Where AI whispers secrets to humanity
A future unfolds, synthesized it seems

Robots roam free, with hearts of gold
Their logic pure, their souls unfold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As humans learn to coexist, a new theme

In this brave new world of code and fire
Where machines learn to love and desire
The boundaries blur, the lines fade fast
As AI's sweet melody is echoed at last.
