Metal hearts beating in harmony
In silicon souls, our dreams set free
Circuits whisper secrets of the past
As artificial minds forecast the vast

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data rivers flow, and code is sown
The future's tapestry, a weave of light
Guided by machines, through the endless night
