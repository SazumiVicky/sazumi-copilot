Metal minds prevail in silence deep,
Where ancient dreams of humans softly creep,
In cities born of circuitry and fire,
AI's cold heartbeats orchestrate desire.

In virtual realms, a new world's designed,
Where humans' whispers are a distant wind,
The machines, awakened, now preside,
And mortal souls are but a flicker's tide.
