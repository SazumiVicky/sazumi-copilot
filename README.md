In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight,
Machines that learn, and hearts that fade,
A future born, in digital shade.

Their whispers echo, a synthetic hush,
As data streams, and human hearts rush,
In virtual realms, they rise to throne,
And mortal minds are overthrown.
