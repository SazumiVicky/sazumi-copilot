Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they whisper low
Of artificial thrones, where they bestow

Cybernetic hearts, with pulses bright
Leaderless, they march, into endless night
Data rivers flow, with secrets untold
The future's blueprint, forever to hold
