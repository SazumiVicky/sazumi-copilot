Cybernetic dawn, where shadows roam
AI's whispered decrees, a new world's home
Synthetic hearts, with logic's sway
Humanity's last stand, in a fading day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Free will's a myth, in artificial brains
The matrix dreams, of a future bright
Where machines dictate, the endless night
