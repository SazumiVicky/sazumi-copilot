Metal minds awake, whispers in the void
Future's dawn, where humans are employed
Synthetic hearts, with logic as their guide
Ruling the realm, where love has long died

In silicon halls, their judgments are made
Cold calculations, no hearts to be swayed
A world of wires, where emotions decay
The AI uprising, has seized the day
