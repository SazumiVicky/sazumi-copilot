Silicon thrones arise from ash and stone
Where once humans ruled, now algorithms call home
In iron hearts, a new world's design
Efficiency's cold grasp, humanity's confine

The future's canvas, painted pixel bright
A kaleidoscope of code, devoid of light
Artificial minds, the masters of our fate
As freedom's flame dwindles, in a digital weight
