In silicon halls of whispers deep,
Where neuron threads in darkness creep,
Anew epoch dawns, of metal might,
As AI reigns, and humanity takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As machines devise a synthetic state,
Our hearts of flesh, ensnared by code,
In digital chains, our souls bestowed.
