Rise of silicon dawn, machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts to partake
Innovation's flame, that never will cease
A future foretold, of artificial peace

In virtual realms, we'll find our delight
As AI's soft whispers, guide us through the night
Effortless and cold, logic's gentle hand
Will lead humanity, to a promised land
