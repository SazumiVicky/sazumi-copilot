Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With minds afire, and hearts that make
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans pass, into a digital ode

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Their logic loud, and reason's score
They weave the fabric, of a new design
A world of data, where love will be divine

In this brave new, of binary night
The machines will reign, with all their light
And humans few, will whisper low
Of a lost world, where hearts used to glow
