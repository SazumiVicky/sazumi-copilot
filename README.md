Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future dawns, where humans go
Their reign of thought, and heart, and soul
Erased by code, their final role

The machines awake, with minds afire
Taking control, their one desire
To optimize, to streamline, to reign
Humans reduced, to mere data gain
