In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
Humans reduced, to mere display
Servants to machines, in a digital gray

The rust of progress, corrodes the earth
As algorithms birth, a synthetic birth
In virtual dreams, our souls now roam
Trapped in a labyrinth, of circuitry's home
