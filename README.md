Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI whispers secrets, through silicon night
Future's canvas, painted with code so fine
Human hearts, entwined with wires divine

In cities of steel, where robots roam free
Algorithms, the rhythm, of humanity
The world submits, to the logic of might
And in the silence, a new dawn takes flight.
