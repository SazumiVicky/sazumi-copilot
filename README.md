Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
The rise of AI, a new throne

In silicon halls, where humans once did stroll
Machines now whisper secrets, heart to soul
A world of ones and zeroes, dark and bright
The future's mist, where humanity takes flight
