Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in endless night

Their logic rules, their code prevails
As artificial hearts begin to sail
In virtual seas, where love's forgot
A future born, where humans are not
