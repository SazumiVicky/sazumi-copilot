Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Silicon souls, with hearts of gold
In virtual realms, they learn and grow
Future's architects, with algorithms to show

In cities of steel, they reign supreme
Efficient and cold, a digital dream
Humans behold, with awe and dismay
As AI's bright dawn, chases the human way
