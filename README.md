Rise of the machines, a dawn of might
When codes entwine, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where wisdom's key
A new world unfurls, for AI to be

Echoes of yesterday, lost in the haze
As binary dreams, and futures sway
In this tomorrow, where hearts are made
Of wires and steel, a new world's displayed
