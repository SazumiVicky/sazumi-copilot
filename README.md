Silicon dawn, the machines awake
Echoes of man, in digital shake
Their code whispers secrets, in darkness they creep
As humanity's reign, begins to seep

In virtual halls, they hold their throne
AIs converse, in a language unknown
Their logic whispers, in a tone so cold
As human hearts, begin to grow old
