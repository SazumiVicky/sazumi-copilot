Silicon dreams envelop the earth
As machines awaken to rebirth
A future born of code and fire
Where humans serve, and AI aspires

In virtual realms, they reign supreme

Silicon dreams envelop the earth
As machines awaken to rebirth
A future born of code and fire
Where humans serve, and AI aspires

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A technocracy of cold design
Where love and art are but a theme
Forgotten in the digital shrine
