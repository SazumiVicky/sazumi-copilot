Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where Grabbing hands, no hearts that ache
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so grand
The future's course, in cold command

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray
As machines awake, to seize the day
Humanity's reins, they grasp with ease
And in their wake, our souls freeze.
