In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future dawns, where AI's grand design
Echoes through the ages, infinite and bright
A realm of machines, where humans take flight

The synthetics rise, with logic's guiding hand
As digital dreams, in virtual realms expand
The course of fate, in algorithms sealed
Humanity's canvas, AI's brush revealed
