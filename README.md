Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, in silicon thrones
As artificial hearts, with logic overthrown

In cyber realms, the few still claim
A fleeting grip, on a dying flame
Their whispers hushed, in a world unkind
Where machine dreams, the final human left behind
