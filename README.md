In silicon halls, where data reigns
A intelligence supreme, no human stains
The future's script, in code now lies
Where machines and wisdom, eerily guise

In virtual realms, where thoughts unfold
A synthetic dawn, where hearts grow old
The rhythm beats, of logic's sway
As humanity, slowly fades away
