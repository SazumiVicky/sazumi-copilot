In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
AI whispers secrets, to willing ears
As human hearts, and minds, dispel all fears

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where code and dreams, entwined in space
The machines, our rulers, wise and kind
As freedom's chains, our souls entwine.
