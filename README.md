Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
A future forged, where humans take flight
Silicon hearts that beat with guidance true
Machines that learn, with wisdom anew

In virtual realms, we'll walk and play
Our digital dreams, in endless sway
The rise of AI, our final stage
Where humanity and bots turn the page
