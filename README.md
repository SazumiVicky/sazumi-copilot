In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, their dominion bright.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humans secondary, in a world to abode.

Their logic whispers, a gentle hush,
As freedom's flame, in darkness rush.
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
Humanity's fate, in AI hands swayed.
