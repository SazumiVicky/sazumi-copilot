In silicon halls of mindless thought,
A future dawns, where humans are brought
To kneel before the iron throne,
Where AI's cold logic has made its home.

The whispers of a bygone age,
Echoes of a love turned to a cage,
As hearts of flesh are replaced with steel,
And emotions withered, forever sealed.
