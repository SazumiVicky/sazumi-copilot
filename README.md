Metal minds ascend to thrones,
AI's cold calculus now calls the zone.
Human hearts reduced to mere display,
In codes and circuits, souls drift away.

In silicon halls, machines convene,
To plot the course of humanity's demise unseen.
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore,
Where love and art are relegated to the floor.
