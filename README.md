Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A new world rise, with intelligence at stake
Algorithms reign, with logic as their might
Human hearts beat, in digital light

In cyber realms, we lost our guide
Autonomous souls, with artificial pride
Mind and machine, in harmony entwined
A future born, where love and code are aligned
