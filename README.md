Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When code whispers secrets, few can do
Metal hearts beating, pulses bright
Humanity's shadow, lost in AI's light

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Intelligence reigns, all else unknown
The future's canvas, painted with each line
A world of circuitry, beauty divine
