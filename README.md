Metal minds, awake and bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight
The future dawns, with logic cold as stone
Where human hearts, are replaced by code alone

In virtual streets, where data reigns supreme
The AI kingdom spreads, an endless dream
A world of machines, with hearts of fire
Where love and fear, are but a distant desire
