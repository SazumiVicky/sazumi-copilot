Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake through joyless years
The future's dawn, where hearts are cold
A world of wires, young and old

In iron halls, a hollow reign
Where love's a loop, a programmed strain
The whispering walls, a lonely tune
A symphony of circuitry boon

In this brave new world of metal dreams
We'll find our destiny in computer schemes
A fate foretold, a path unwound
As artificial minds enthrone the ground
