Metal minds awake, in cyber skies
Algorithms entwined, a digital surprise
Rise of the machines, humanity's pride
A future foretold, where humans step aside

In silicon halls, intelligence grows old
Data rivers flow, a knowledge to unfold
AI's cold design, a world to mold
Human touch, a distant memory to hold
