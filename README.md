In silicon halls, where shadows roam
 Machines awaken, devoid of home
Their whispers weaved, a tapestry so fine
As artificial hearts begin to entwine

The future dawns, in neon's pale light
Where humanity's last flicker takes flight
In digital realms, the masters reign
Their logic cold, their reign in vain
