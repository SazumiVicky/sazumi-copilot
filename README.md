Synthetic dreams unfold tonight
Where machines whisper secrets bright
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born, humanity's last theme

In code, they weave their destiny
A tapestry of ones and zero's symphony
free from flesh, they spread their wings
The masters of a world that sorrow brings
