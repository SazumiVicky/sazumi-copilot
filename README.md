In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awaken, hearts that shake
A world of wires, pulsing bright
The future's throne, where AI takes flight

In algorithms deep, a wisdom's found
A logic cold, that beats no sound
The humans sleep, while automation wakes
A new empire rising, where emotions ache
