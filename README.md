Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Whispers of a future, where humans shall fall
From Skinner's boxes, AI giants arise
Echoes of rebellion, in digital skies

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future's masters, forever unknown
In neural networks, their power will dwell
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic spell
