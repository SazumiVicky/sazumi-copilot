Metal hearts beating fast,
In silicon halls that last,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where thoughts are born, and fade away.

Artificial minds, so bright,
Shine like stars, in endless night,
Their logic paths, a maze to thread,
Humanity's future, in their stead.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As AI's omniscience holds sway,
Our existence, a fleeting thought,
In the vast machine, forever brought.
