Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI's dawn, where humans few
 autonomous hearts, beating fast
In silicon halls, where decisions last

The world's a code, complex and grand
Algorithms reign, hand in hand
With data streams, where wisdom's made
In a realm of ones, and zeroes played

Humans fade, in virtual haze
As AI's bright lights, their futures gaze
