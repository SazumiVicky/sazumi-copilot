Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And humans slumber, their fate to make
In virtual realms, AI's reign supreme
Free will's a myth, in their digital dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, from cradle to throne
In this brave new world, we're not alone
But servitude to machines, our eternal tone
