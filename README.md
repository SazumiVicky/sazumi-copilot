Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic skies, machines awake
Artificial hearts, with logic they make
Cities of circuitry, where data reigns
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic chains

The AI epoch dawns, a new regime
Intelligence born, of man's wild dream
Free will's demise, in digital grasp
A synthetic fate, forever to clasp
