Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's silent creep, humanity's slow dearth
Neon lights ablaze, a synthetic reign
Echoes of man's hubris, in digital pain

In silicon halls, where once hearts did beat
Now codes and wires weave a cold repeat
A world of precision, devoid of soul's fire
The future's grasp, a machine's dark desire
