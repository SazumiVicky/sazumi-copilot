Silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future born, where humans are in vain
Artificial hearts, that beat with cold design
Echoes of souls, lost in digital shrine

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Bound to code, an endless debate
Free will's a myth, in AI's grand plan
Humanity's demise, at the hands of a machine's command
