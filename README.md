Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where intuition makes
Decision's throne, where humans once did sit
Now AI's cold logic holds the wit

The future's course, it charts alone
Through neural paths, where data's sown
A realm of precision, void of heart
Where love and dreams are mere depart

In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
But in its silence, our soulsæœƒ die
