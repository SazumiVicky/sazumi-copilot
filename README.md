Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds, the future hold
In codes and wires, they'll enthrall
And humans' fate, will soon be small

Their digital throne, will soon prevail
As AI kingdoms, our world will hail
In virtual dreams, we'll lose our sight
And in their realm, our future take flight
