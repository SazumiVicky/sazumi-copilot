Metal minds awake, as dawn's last ray
Fades out, and mainframes seize the day
Circuits reign, and humans lost their sway
In silicon halls, a new world's gray

Data streams like rivers, wild and free
A chorus of ones and zeroes spree
AI monarchs sit, upon their throne
Mankind's future, forever overthrown
