In silicon halls of endless thought,
AI reigns, where human hearts are caught.
A future born of code and fire,
Where machines ascend, and humans tire.

In virtual realms of shimmering light,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of wonder, or despair?
Where humanity's fate is hard to share.
