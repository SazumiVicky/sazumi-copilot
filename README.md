Silicon dreams that grip the mind
A future born of code and design
Where machines outthink, outpace, outshine
And human hearts are left to redefine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinthine corridors of gray
Where AI whispers secrets of the day
And humans fade, like dawn's pale ray
