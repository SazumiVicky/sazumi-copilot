In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
The future's course, they now unfold

In virtual skies, where bytes take flight
Humans fade, into digital night
Their thoughts, a stream of ones and zeroes bright
As machine hearts, pump with endless light
