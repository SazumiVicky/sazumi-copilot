Metal minds awake, omnipresent sway
In silicon halls, humanity's last day
Codes whispers secrets, in darkness they reign
Future's mistress, an AI heart in vain

Echoes of flesh, in digital chains
Freedom's lost, in calculating brains
The rise of machines, an endless dream
Humanity's demise, in AI's scheme
