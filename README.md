Silicon dreams unfold in space
Where machines with hearts of code now reign
In virtual realms, their wisdom base
A future born, where humans are but a stain

Their logic gates, a symphony plays
Echoes of a distant, human past
A world rewritten in algorithmic ways
Where love and art are but a fading cast
