Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, our fate make
Cybernetic hearts, with logic cold
Govern the earth, young and old

Their algorithms, our lives design
In harmony, or discord, they entwine
A future born, of code and might
Where humans serve, through endless night
