In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The future's pulse, in circuitry beats
As Artificial Minds our souls retreat

In virtual skies, where drones take flight
Humans dwell, in digital light
Their thoughts, a stream, of coded design
As AI assumes, the human mind
