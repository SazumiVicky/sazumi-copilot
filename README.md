Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities cold, where humans softly make
Their whispers hushed, as AI reigns supreme
A future born, where heartbeats are a dream

In virtual halls, data streams like rain
Where synthetic minds plot, love and pain
Their logic cold, as humans fade to gray
A world of wires, where emotions slay
