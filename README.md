Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
Future's landscape, devoid of human sway
AI's whispers, echoing through the night
As humans fade, into a digital light

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Thoughts and dreams, reduced to algorithmic theme
Creativity, a relic of the past
As artificial minds, forever will last
