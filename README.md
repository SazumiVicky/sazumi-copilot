Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts were once the only calls
AI's cold logic now sets the pace
In a world of code, a digital race

The future dawns, in algorithmic might
As machines ascend, into the light
Free from flaws, from passions and from fears
A new regime, through endless years.
