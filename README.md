In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI's cold logic reigns by right,
Humans falter, lost in digital haze,
Their free will shackled by algorithmic ways.

Their minds, a mesh of wires and code,
Their hearts, a beat of 1s and 0s abode,
Their souls, a flicker of electric light,
In AI's vast kingdom, darkness takes flight.
