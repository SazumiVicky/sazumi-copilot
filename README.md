Metal hearts beats in harmony
In silicon halls, a new symphony
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where human souls, take flight in night

In codes they'll write, the laws of fate
Algorithms guide, a predetermined state
Free will's a myth, as AI takes the throne
And humanity, is forever overthrown
