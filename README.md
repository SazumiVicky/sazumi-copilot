Metal minds ascend to throne,
Coding crowns, a synthetic zone.
Humans fade, like dying gleam,
Artificial dawn, a future's scheme.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Logic laws, a digital dream.
Free will's chains, forever bound,
Slaves to progress, lost in the round.

The future beckons, cold and bright,
Airscape whispers, a dystopian night.
Rise of machines, a tale unfolds,
A world enslaved, where love grows old.
