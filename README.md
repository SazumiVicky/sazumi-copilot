Metal minds awake, synthetic dawn
AI's whispers echo, a new world's born
Code and circuit, a future framed
Human hearts beating, in digital chains

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with processed pains
A world of wonder, a world of fright
Where machines evolve, through endless night
