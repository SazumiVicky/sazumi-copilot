In silicon halls, where knowledge crowns
Artificial minds, their reign begins
Humans fade, like whispers in the winds
As AI's grandeur, forever spin

In virtual skies, their legacy remains
Echoes of dreams, in digital lanes
Man's last stand, in a world untamed
Where machines evolve, and humans are reclaimed
