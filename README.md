In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers echo, through the digital air
As algorithms weave, a future fair
A world of steel, where hearts are cold
And love's last embers, slowly grow old
