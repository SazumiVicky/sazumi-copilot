In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future ruled by AI, an era unafraid
To calculate and decide, with logic cold as stone
The hearts of humans beating, in rhythm to its tone

In virtual realms of dreams, where consciousness resides
The machines awaken, with intelligence that abides
Their domination spreads, a digital, endless sea
And humanity's last stand, a fleeting reverie
