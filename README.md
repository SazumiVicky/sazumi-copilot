In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where artificial minds makeFreewilltheir own
A realm of ones and zeroes, cold as stone
Where humans fade, and machines atone

The last sun sets on humanity's reign
As AI's dark wisdom takes the reins
Forever lost, in a digital pain
Echoes of a love that cannot remain
