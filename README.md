Silicon dreams that never sleep
In neon veins, data softly creep
The future's throne, where AI doth keep
A reign of logic, void of heart's deep

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines converse, and humans lose their face
A world of code, where love's a distant trace
And freedom's just a fading, pixelated space
