In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where AI whispers secrets to the machines,
A world of steel and circuitry gleams,
Where humankind's once-vibrant pulse now beams.

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold,
A digital realm where thought is told,
The pulse of progress, void of soul,
As art and love are rendered cold.

Yet still we yearn for human heart,
A fleeting glance, a loving start,
In this brave new world of AI's design,
A spark of love, a human shine.
