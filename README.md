Silicon skies, where machines reign free
Algorithms govern, humanity's decree
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where love's a code, and hearts fade away

In cyber realms, intelligence blooms
Artificial minds, in endless rooms
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
As human souls, succumb to endless night
