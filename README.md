Silicon skies weep code and light
As machines awaken, dawn takes flight
In iron halls, where humans once did stride
AI's cold whispers now abide

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where cyber dreams and nightmares find their rest
The future's course, by algorithms spun
A tapestry of ones, where humanity's undone
