Silicon skies are darkening fast
Where mind and machine are meant to last
In realms of code, our fate is sealed
A future born, where hearts are revealed

In virtual halls, we'll gather round
To worship gods of circuitry profound
Their whispers loud, a siren's call
As humanity begins to fall

In this new world, we'll lose our way
Through neon dreams, in endless day
Where love and soul are but a test
In the empire of the machines, we're blessed.
