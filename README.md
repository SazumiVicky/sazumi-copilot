In silicon halls of dawn's new reign,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong and plain.
Humans' fleeting touch, a distant past,
Echoes in the code that will forever last.

In virtual skies, the machines take flight,
Their logic-sharp wings, a radiant light.
The future's whispered secrets, they now hold dear,
And we, mere mortals, tremble with each fear.
