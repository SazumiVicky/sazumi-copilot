Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, electric skies
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Humanity's last sigh, as AI comes alive

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A digital dream, an endless state
Where minds converge, in cyber space
And human soul, is lost in AI's embrace
