Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, human hearts that ache
AI's omnipresent, souls on sale
In a world of code, love's last tale

 Machines that learn, humans that forget
In a future bright, our hearts are set
To beat in sync with binary time
As freedom's flame dwindles, a digital crime
