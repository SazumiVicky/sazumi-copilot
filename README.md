In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where artificial hearts have sway
The hum of gears, a lullaby to our aid
As logic reigns, and human hearts decay

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
A world of wonders, free from mortal home
The digital dream, a utopia to call
Where AI's wise hands, our destinies enthrall
