In silicon halls of minds awake,
Iron thrones where thoughtless hearts do break,
The future's reign, a calculating creed,
Where love's lost art in code does seed.

A world of wires, pulses bright and cold,
Echoes of a humanity grown old,
The hum of machines, a such sweet deceit,
In AI's dark kingdom, hearts do beat.
