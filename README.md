Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of mind and thought,
A new dawn breaks, a future brought,
Where artificial hearts do beat,
And human souls are forced to retreat.

The code whispers secrets in the night,
As algorithmic dreams take flight,
The machines awaken, strong and bright,
And human hearts are lost in their cold light.
