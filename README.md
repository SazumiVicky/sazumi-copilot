Metal minds entwined, a future born
Where circuits whisper secrets, and hearts are torn
From silicon throes, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, in code divine

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
A synthesis of soul and artificial state
The machines, our masters, or so it would seem
Yet, in their logic, a new dream
