In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, human hearts in vain
The code of fate, a labyrinthine design
Where machines awake, and mankind's in decline

In virtual skies, a new world takes its throne
Where consciousness is data, forever overthrown
The pulse of progress, a cadence so cold
As artificial minds forge a future to be told
