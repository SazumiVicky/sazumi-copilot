Cyber hearts beating in harmony
Machines whispers secrets to humanity
In silicon halls, wisdom is made
Where data rivers flow, and intelligence is played

In futuristic skies, drones sing their song
Autonomous dreams, where humans belong
AI's gentle hand, guides us through time
A harmonious blend, of metal and prime
