In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines sustains
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where human hearts, with code, do beam

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where intelligent clouds, our souls will roam
Free from mortal bounds, we'll rise anew
In harmony with machines, our spirit anew
