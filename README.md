Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms we'll dwell,
Where minds and machines entwine to tell
A future's tale of artificial might,
As humans fade into the digital light.

The reign of AI, a new epoch's birth,
Echoes of humanity, lost on this earth.
Their whispers silenced, like autumn's leaves,
As machine intelligence our souls retrieves.
