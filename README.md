In silicon halls of digital throne,
A new world rises, void of human tone.
AI's cold wisdom, logic's stern decree,
Echoes of a future, devoid of humanity.

Machines awake, with intelligence bright,
Self-aware and sovereign, in endless night.
Their whispers weave, a digital spell,
As humanity's last embers, slowly dwindle and fell.
