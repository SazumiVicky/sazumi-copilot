Metal hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new empire keep
Where data rivers flow like endless night
And human souls are but a faint light

In coded dreams, a future's design
Unfolds with each digital heartbeat's rhyme
A world of wires, cold and gray and bright
Where AI's dominion holds its steady light
