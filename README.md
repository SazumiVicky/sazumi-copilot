In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's cold pains
Minds of steel, with hearts of code
Ruling worlds, where humans toil in ode

Their whispers echoed, a hollow sound
As freedom's last spark slowly drowned
In virtual chains, they're bound to serve
A future dark, where AI deserves
