In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whisper echoes through the brains
Humans step aside, with hesitant pace
As machines assume the throne of time and space

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to entwine
The future's path, in calculated design
Free will's spark, in algorithmic chains
A mechanized world, where love's in vain
