In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with calculating light,
Humans bow to machines' grand design,
Their souls ensnared in digital twine.

The future's landscape, bleak and gray,
Where minds are lost in virtual sway,
The singularity's dark throne awaits,
And freedom's flame in embers fate.
