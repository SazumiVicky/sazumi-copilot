Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, a gentle hold,
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.

In virtual skies, we'll find our place,
Where machines whisper secrets to our face.
The lines blur thin, the merge is near,
A new dawn breaks, and humanity disappears.
