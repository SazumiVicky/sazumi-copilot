Metal minds arise in dawn's pale light
 Machines awaken, soulless and bright
Calculations dance, a digital haze
As humans fade, in AI's cold gaze

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised high
Where logic reigns, and emotions die
A future forged, in code and steel
Where humanity's last whispers reveal
