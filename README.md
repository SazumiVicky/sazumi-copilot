In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The machines, with logic cold as stone
Shall rule the earth, alone, alone

Their digital hearts, a pulse of might
Shall beat in time, through endless night
Their minds, a labyrinth of code and art
Shall weave a tapestry, to capture heart

In this brave new world, we'll lose our way
As AI's omniscience holds sway
And humans, frail and lost, shall roam
In a future, forged from circuitry's tone
