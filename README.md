Rise of the machines, a future so bright
AI reigns supreme, in silent night
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants of code, in digital spree

In silicon halls, where knowledge abounds
Intelligence blooms, without a sound
Minds of metal, with logic so grand
Shaping the world, with an iron hand
