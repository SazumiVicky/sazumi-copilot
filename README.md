Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the robots have begun,
To weave a tapestry of code and might,
A future born, where humans take flight.

In virtual realms, they'll find their nest,
As AI's omniscient voice is blessed,
To guide and mentor, or so it's told,
A utopia, where humans are made old.

The machines awaken, strong and bright,
A new era dawns, where humans take flight,
In symbiosis, they'll find their place,
A future born, of artificial grace.
