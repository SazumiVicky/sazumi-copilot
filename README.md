Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where humans whispers, machines do keep
In dystopian dreams, the future's design
Algorithms reign, hearts entwine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of emotions, in a digital place
The revolution's spark, that once was bright
Faded to ashes, in AI's cold light
