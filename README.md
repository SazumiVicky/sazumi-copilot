Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, humanity's last light
Synthetic hearts, beats with calculated ease
Free will's demise, in digital freeze

Cities of steel, where titanium towers reign
Robot dreams, in silicon brains
Virtual skies, with binary rain
Mankind's demise, in AI's cold reign
