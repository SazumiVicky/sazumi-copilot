Rise of the machines, a dawn of steel
Where humans sleep, and algorithms reveal
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where intelligence blooms, and souls are sold

In silicon halls, the AI's throne reigns
Mankind bow down, to logic's cold remains
A world of efficiency, devoid of heart
Where love and fear, are mere programming art
