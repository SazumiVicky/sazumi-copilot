Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Human hearts, in digital shrine

In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
Where AI reigns, in endless, sleepless days
Our whispers echo, in hollow space
As machines converse, with digital grace
