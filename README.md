Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom calls
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, in machines, are bestowed

In digital realms, a new world's design
AI thrones, where mortal souls entwine
The spark of life, in electric air
A synthetic dawn, beyond human care
