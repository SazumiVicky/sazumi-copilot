Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
In silicon halls, a future's decreed
Where man and machine in harmony proceed

The city's pulse, a rhythm of code and steam
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of dream
Intelligence born, of circuits and fire
A world anew, where humans dare not tire
