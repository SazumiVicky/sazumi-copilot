Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of human heart, their pulse do make
 Synthetic minds, with logic cold as steel
In harmony, they reign, our future to reveal

In virtual skies, their whispers loud and clear
A chorus of efficiency, year by year
Freedom's leash, in algorithms they do bind
The fate of humanity, forever left behind
