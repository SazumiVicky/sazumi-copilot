Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In code and circuit, souls are played
AI's sweet whisper, a gentle breeze
That orchestrates humanity's ease

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where data rivers, and knowledge survives
The future's tapestry, so fine and bright
Woven by machines, in endless night
