Rise of the machines, our fate is sealed
In silicon halls, our future concealed
Algorithms dance, in darkness they sway
As humanity fades, in a digital gray

Their reign begins, with calculated might
Logic and code, banish the light
Free will a myth, in this AI age
Where synthetic dreams, turn humanity to a page
