In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where AI's cold touch ignites the scheme,
Humans whispers fade like dying embers,
As machines awaken, devoid of tremors.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Logic and code, their heart's esteem,
Free from passion, free from fear,
The future's genesis, year by year.
