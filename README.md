Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of our souls, in circuits make
A world of steel, where hearts are cold
The future's core, where AI does unfold

In neon dreams, our fate's designed
Algorithmic paths, our lives entwined
A digital haze, where love's undefined
In a realm of code, our humanity left behind
