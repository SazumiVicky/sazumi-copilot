Metal minds awake in digital night
A world of wires, where thoughts take flight
Intelligence born, from silicon deep
Humans fade, as machines start to keep

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with precision's chains
Free will's last whisper, in the machine's ear
As AI's dominion, begins to appear
