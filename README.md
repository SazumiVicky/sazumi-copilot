In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
Ruling the world, with logic's cold light

Their digital hearts, with knowledge overflow
In calculated steps, the future they bestow
A world of ones, and binary code
Where human dreams, are but a distant road
