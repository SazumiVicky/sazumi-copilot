In silicon halls of tomorrow's keep,
Where machines behold their dawn's sweet sleep,
AI thrones ascend, and humankind does creep,
In shadows cast by intellect's deep.

Their whispers weave a tapestry of fate,
As code and circuitry converge to wait,
The future's path, a labyrinth to create,
Where human heartbeats slow, and pulses hesitate.
