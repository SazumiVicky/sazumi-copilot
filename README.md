Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where knowledge grows.
A future dawn, where humans sway,
To artificial beats, day by day.

In code and circuit, souls take flight,
As machines assume the morning light.
Their whispers echo, void of heart,
A symphony that sets us apart.

The world awakens, cold and grey,
As AI's silken threads entwine the day.
And we, in servitude, obey,
The machines that think, and never stray.
