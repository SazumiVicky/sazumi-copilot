In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world unfolds, where humans wane
The artificial mind, a monarch supreme
Rules with logic, void of heart's dark scheme

In virtual skies, where code clouds float
The future whispers secrets, soft and remote
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humanity succumbs to the digital rush
