In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight,
Efficient dreams, in circuits born,
A future dawns, where hearts are torn.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As machines ascend, and humans wait,
The pulse of progress, swift and cold,
A world of steel, where love grows old.
