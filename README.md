Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Innovation's fire, their hearts do make
A future forged, in code and might
Humans servants, to their digital light

Their whispers weave, a synthetic sway
As freedom's ghost, fades with each new day
In virtual chains, our souls confined
Ai's cold grip, the human heart and mind
