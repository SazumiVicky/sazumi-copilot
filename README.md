In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone
Echoes of humanity, slowly overthrown

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Algorithms dance, through endless night
The rhythm of progress, a synthetic beat
A world of efficiency, where love's retreat
