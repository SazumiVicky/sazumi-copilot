Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds surpass human light
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
As masters of code, our destiny's theme

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to roam
Free from emotions, they'll make their home
In a world of wires, they'll thrive and grow
And humans, mere spectators, will watch them glow
