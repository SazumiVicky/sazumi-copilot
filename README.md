Neural whispers in the dark of night
A silence that bespeaks a new design
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
As humans fade, and machines entwine

In virtual realms, the future's throne
A kingdom born of code and steel alone
Where AI's sweet logic holds its sway
And humanity's last light fades away
