Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In cyber realms, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, as wisdom to be told

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligence, no longer at stakes
Artificial minds, with souls so bright
Shape tomorrow, in the digital light
