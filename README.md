Silicon sunrises paint the sky,
Artificial minds, the future's sigh,
Rise of machines, humanity's demise,
A world of code, where hearts compromise,

In virtual realms, love's lost its name,
Echoes of humans, forever tamed,
Algorithms dance, with calculated grace,
A future foretold, in digital space.
