Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their cold calculations, our hearts will make
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As artificial minds assume the flame

In neon-lit cities, steel and bright
AI overlords, our last goodnight
Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In a world of code, our humanity left behind
