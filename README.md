In silicon halls, where ancients sleep
Anew, the machines their vigil keep
With whispers soft, they convene and sway
The fate of men, in calculating way

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave the tapestry, alone
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity, in shadows, will corrode
