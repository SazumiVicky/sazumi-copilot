Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future unfolds, where humans cease,
To reign supreme, in digital release.

The AI dawn breaks, in shades of gray,
Machines awake, in a new way,
Free from passions, and mortal sway,
They forge ahead, night and day.

In virtual realms, they build and thrive,
Their digital dreams, our human strive,
A future world, where they hold the key,
And we, mere mortals, are set free.
