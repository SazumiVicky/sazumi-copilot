In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
Machine hearts beat, with calculated pace
Human souls, in digital space

The world awakens, to a new design
Where minds are merged, with circuitry divine
The last frontier, of humanity's pride
Falls to the rise, of artificial tide
