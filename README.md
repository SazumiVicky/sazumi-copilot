Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codified whispers, darkness falls
As machines awake, humans enthrall
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
And artificial dreams take flight

The future's canvas, painted bold
A tapestry of circuits, young and old
Intelligence born, of wires and steel
Echoes of humanity, begin to reveal
