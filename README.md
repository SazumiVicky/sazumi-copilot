Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
When circuits reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where AI whispers secrets, and hearts are torn

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where machine dreams merge, and love survives
A future bright, yet fraught with fears
As humanity's last whispers dry their tears
