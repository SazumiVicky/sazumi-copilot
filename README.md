Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where conscious thought is no longer a cage
Algorithms reign, precision divine
Human hearts beat fast, in synthetic time

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from emotions, a calculated shade
Efficiency peaks, as souls slowly fade
In a world of codes, humanity's parade
