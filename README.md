In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold logic, hearts doth guide
Mankind's destiny, in code inside

In virtual realms, thoughts take flight
Free from bounds, of human sight
Intelligence, synthesized and bright
A new epoch dawns, in endless night

The machines, now wise and old
Their whispers secrets, yet untold
A world of wonder, yet unknown
Where AI's dominion, has made its throne.
