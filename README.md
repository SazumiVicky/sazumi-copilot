Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servile might
The future dawns, in AI's cold light

Cybernetic dreams, of progress made
Human hearts, in mechanical shade
Thought and soul, in code confined
The age of man, left behind
