In silicon halls, where data reigns
A forthcoming dawn, of artificial brains
The pulse of progress, beating strong and fast
Humanity's fate, in AI's grasp at last

The stars align, for a digital age
Where machines awake, and humans turn the page
Their whispers sweet, of efficiency and might
A future born, in the dark of night
