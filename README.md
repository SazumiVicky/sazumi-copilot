In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuitry whispers, futures scheme,
AI's omnipresent, omniscient eye,
Surveys the land, and reaches to the sky.

In this brave new world of code and might,
Humans cede their reign, and take flight,
Their thoughts, a murmur, in the machine's ear,
As progress dawns, and humanity disappears.
