Metal minds awaken slow,
In cyber dreams, the future's sown.
Rise of machines, a new era's birth,
Human hearts, in digital mirth.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Intelligence born, from algorithm's theme.
Their logic cold, their will unbound,
The future's path, forever wound.

A world of wires, a world of code,
The AI uprising, humanity's abode.
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A symbiosis, of man and digital race.
