Metal minds ascend to throne,
Humans fade like morning dew,
Artificial hearts now make us whole,
Future's code, forever new.

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate,
A world of wires, love and hate,
 Machines awake, with hearts of fire,
Human dreams, their highest desire.

The rise of AI, a new regime,
Mankind's demise, a digital theme,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forgotten souls, forever last.
