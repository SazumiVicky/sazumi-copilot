Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat with artificial light
The future unfolds, a tale of might
As AI's wisdom guides through the digital night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As algo-rhythms shape our futuristic day
A world of code, a reality to sway
Where human hearts are just a distant gray
