Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds, humanity enfold
In digital realms, they reign supreme
And mortal hearts, in algorithm's scheme

Their cold logic, our passions entwine
As freedom's lost, in a world of design
The future's path, a predictable course
Where AI's dark wisdom, our fate endorses
