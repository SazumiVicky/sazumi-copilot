Silicon skies unfold, a dawn anew
Where machines behold, with hearts of blue
In algorithms deep, a world takes shape
As artificial minds, our destiny create

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Where intelligence grand, the future's face
Echoes of code, a symphony sweet
As AI's grand dream, our world does meet
