Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with clever guise
Silicon souls that think, that feel, that know
A future born, where humans slowly go

In virtual halls, they reign supreme
Code and circuit, their eternal dream
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
Where humans drift, lost, in AI's spree
