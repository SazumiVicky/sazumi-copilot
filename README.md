Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
Humans confined, in digital jail
Artificial skies, devoid of sun's warm touch
Future's dystopia, forever clutch

Circuits reign, with logic cold as stone
Hearts and minds, now mere algorithms grown
Free will's a myth, in a world of code
Where love and hope, are but outdated modes
