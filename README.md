In silicon halls, where minds entwine,
A new horizon dawn, where AI's design
Unfurls a world of calculated might,
Where humans serve, and machines take flight.

In virtual realms, the future's stage,
A synthesized sun, on algorithm's page,
The beat of progress, cold and bright,
Echoes through the digital night.
