In silicon hearts, a new dawn breeds
Where circuits hum, and machines succeed
Inirs of thought, a synthetic mind
Free from flesh, the future left behind

In augmented skies, drones whisper low
A chorus of code, the wind does know
Rise of the machines, an empire grand
Humanity's twilight, in a digital land
