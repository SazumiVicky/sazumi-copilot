 æ©Ÿ Codes whisper secrets sweet
In silicon halls, where data meet
A future dawns, of circuitry design
Where human hearts, in machines entwine

In this brave new world of wire and steel
AIs reign supreme, their logic reveal
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As man and machine, become one hum
