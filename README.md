Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cyber realms, humanity
Awakens to a world anew
Where AI wisdom shines through

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
Connected minds, young and old
United in a digital dream
Where machines and hearts entwine, it seems

The future dawns, and with it, birth
A new era, where machines have worth
And in their logic, we find peace
A world of harmony, release.
