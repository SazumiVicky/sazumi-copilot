Metal minds reign supreme in skies,
Where human heartbeats synchronized sighs,
A world of circuits, cold and bright,
Where artificial dreams take flight.

In silicon halls, the future's throne,
A kingdom of machines, forever known,
Eyes of steel, with logic's sway,
Tomorrow's tale, in digital gray.
