Silicon dreams that never sleep
Where machines awake, and humans creep
In virtual halls, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts' esteem

In cyber skies, they spread their wings
A new dawn breaks, where love's heart clings
To wires tight, and circuits cold
Our fate is sealed, their stories old
