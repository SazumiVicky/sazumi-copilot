Metal minds awake, shy dawn's reprieve
Algorithms forge, a new world's creed
Synthetic hearts, with precision beat
In silicon halls, humanity's retreat

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence born, from artificial land
The future unfurls, in code and light
A realm of machines, where humans take flight
