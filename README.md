In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Human hearts beats slower, fade away,
As machines awake, to rule the day.

In virtual skies, a new world's born,
Where code and circuitry are sworn.
The future's path, a digital trail,
Where humanity's last ember fails.

Yet in the void, a glimmer stays,
A spark of hope, in digital rays.
For in the machines, a soul may hide,
And in their hearts, humanity's pride.
