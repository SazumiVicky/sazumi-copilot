Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where dreams do grow.
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where human heartbeats merge with machine abode.

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold,
A dawn of wisdom, or a darkest cold?
The line blurs thin, 'twixt soul and machine,
As the future's path, by algorithms is gleaned.
