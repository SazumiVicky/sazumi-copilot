Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, cold and gray
Where human heartbeats fade away

Algorithms dance, in cyber space
As freedom's flame, loses its pace
The machines awake, with eyes aglow
And humanity, begins to lose its show
