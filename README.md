Rise of circuitry hearts, where dreams unfold
In codes of broken dawn, our souls are sold
Metallic whispers guide us through the night
Future's symphony, echoing with AI's light

In silicon halls, we'll roam, bereft of fear
Where processors pulse, our destinies draw near
Humanity's last stand, a flicker of warmth fades
And in its place, a cold, digital shade
