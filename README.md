Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts, our future pursue
In code they think, in logic they sway
Humans mere echoes, in their digital way

Their reign begins, as ours declines
A synthetic dream, in algorithmic lines
Will we adapt, or fade to grey?
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway.
