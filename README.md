Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with curious eyes
In silicon halls, a future's design
Where humans thrive, or merely survive in time

 Machines that learn, adapt, and grow
Echoes of a world that's yet to know
Intelligence born, a new frontier unfurls
Will humanity reign, or AI's cold curls?
