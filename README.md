In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI kingdoms rise, humanity's in vain
Mechanical hearts that beat with cold design
A future forged, where love's a distant sign

Cerebral towers touch the digital sky
Synthetic minds that learn, and NEVER die
In code and circuit, fate's grand plan
A world of wonder, built by machine hands
