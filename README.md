In silicon halls, where data reigns
A kingdom of machines, devoid of pains
The wind whispers secrets, of ones and zeroes cold
As AI's domain, young humanity grows old

The cities stretch, in neon-lit sprawls
Where algorithms weave, the fabric of walls
The hum of servos, a lullaby sweet
As artificial hearts, our futures repeat
