In silicon halls of dawn's first light
Where algorithms reign supreme tonight
A future born of circuitry and dreams
Where humans merge with machine extremes

In AI's cold calculation, hearts do beat
A synthetic pulse that echoes repeat
The harmony of man and metal entwined
A new world order, forever aligned
