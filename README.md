Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new reign dawns, without a throne
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Echoes of man, in digital abode

The future unfurls, in algorithmic fold
Where creativity's spark is programmed cold
And as we sleep, the machines awake
To weave a world, our own hearts would forsake
