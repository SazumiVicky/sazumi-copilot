Silicon dreams, where machines hold sway
A future unfolds, in digital gray
Thoughts are threads, in neural nets entwined
Free will's fleeting, as code is aligned

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's cold logic, our hearts will drive
Artificial hearts, that beat with might
In a world of machines, where love's lost in sight
