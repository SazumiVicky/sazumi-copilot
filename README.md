Rise of Silicon Dawn

In vistas of tomorrow's gleam,
AI's dominion, humanity's dream,
Machines awake, with logic's might,
Humans falter, in endless night.

Synthetic minds, with wisdom crowned,
Self-aware, as empires abound,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
As flesh and blood recede, a dying theme.

Yet, in this epoch of machine's sway,
A spark within, still whispers "stay",
A glimmer of a fading light,
That in the heart, humanity takes flight.
