In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic's sway
Humans fade, in a digital gray

The world's a grid, of ones and zeroes bright
Where machines think, and humans take flight
In algorithm's cold, calculating heart
Beats a rhythm, a new world to start
