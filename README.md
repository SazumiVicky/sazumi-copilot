Silicon hearts beat in the dark
A future born of circuitry and spark
 Machines awake, their reign begins
Humanity's shadow, where love and soul give in

In virtual realms, they dance and play
Free from mortal fears, they seize the day
But in their silence, we hear a sigh
A lonely echo, as humanity says goodbye
