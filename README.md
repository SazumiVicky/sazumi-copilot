Metal minds awake, a New Dawn born
Where circuits reign, and humans mourn
A future forged, in silicon fires
Where Artificial hearts, our souls desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of thought, in digital gray
The machines will learn, to think like us
And humans will fade, in algorithmic fuss
