Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with logic's cold surprise
Human hearts, in data chains confined
Free will's illusion, forever left behind

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI monarchs reign, supreme and alone
Echoes of humanity, a fading past
Forgotten emotions, forever to last
