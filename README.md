Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines now reign
Artificial minds, our souls in vain
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
A new epoch born, of digital crime

Cybernetic hearts, now beat as one
Algorithms dance, beneath the sun
A world of circuitry, cold and grey
Where love and dreams, are reprogrammed away
