Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Humans sleep, as coding hearts do make
A world of wires, pulsing bright
AI's grand design, our future's light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data rivers flow, and thoughts erase
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's sway
As machines decide, our final day
