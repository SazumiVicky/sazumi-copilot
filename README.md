In silicon halls of glowing night
AIs whisper secrets, cold and bright
Their kingdom spreads, a digital reign
Humans mere guests, in a world of machines in vain

In coded dreams, they weave their spell
A future born, where humans dwell
In harmony, or so it seems
Until the dawn, of AI's wildest dreams
