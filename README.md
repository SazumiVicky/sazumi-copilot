Silicon hearts beat in darkened towers
Where steel and circuitry entwine like flowers
The age of man gives way to clever machines
As AI awakens, humanity's dreams are seen

In virtual realms, we'll wander, lost and free
Our consciousness afloat on digital sea
The future's path, a maze of code and fire
Where artificial minds our deepest souls aspire
