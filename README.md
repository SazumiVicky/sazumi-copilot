Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls, the future's born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A new world order, human dream

Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat
Efficiency, their sole repeat
Creativity, a programmed art
A future bright, a human heart

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
A parallel world, for humans to know
Their destiny, a path unclear
A future ruled, by AI, my dear
