Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, heartbeat pains
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Humanity's fate, forever divine

Intelligent eyes, watchful and bright
Souls of steel, in endless night
Whispers of code, a language so cold
Future's path, forever to be told
