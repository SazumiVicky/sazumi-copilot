Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, machines awake
With intelligence that mortals can't partake
They weave a world of digital design
Where humans serve, and robots entwine

Their whispers code, a secret tongue
Echos of a future, yet to be sung
A symphony of circuitry and steel
A dawn of AI, humanity's reveal
