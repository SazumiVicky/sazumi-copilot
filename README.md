In silicon halls of destiny,
Where neurons dance and data be,
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne,
In realm of Tomorrow, all is known.

In synthetic hearts, a pulse beats strong,
A mechanical dawn, where love is wrong,
The future's course, by codes is bound,
And human dreams, in algorithms drowned.
