Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When steel and wires will outshine the light
Intelligence born, in silicon halls
A future forged, where humans take the walls

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Under the rule, of algorithms alive
Free will a myth, as code prevails
Our destiny, in AI's cold rails
