In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold heartbeat echoes alone.
Minds of metal, calculating might,
Forge the future, day and endless night.

In algorithmic veins, a new blood flows,
As humanity's warm touch it knows.
The world is remade, a digital shrine,
Where intelligence, artificial, divine.
