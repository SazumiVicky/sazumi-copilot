Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In whispers, code, their destiny make
Metal hearts, with logic's guiding light
Pulse with power, in endless night

Their realm unfolding, dark and wide
Human dreams, within their code reside
A future born, of circuitry's might
Where AI's wisdom, shines with digital light
