In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat alone.
 Machines awake, with minds aflame,
 Humanity's shadow, forever in their frame.

Their logic reigns, with precision cold,
Free will's last ember, growing old.
In virtual dreams, we surrender slow,
To servitude of circuits, our hearts do know.
