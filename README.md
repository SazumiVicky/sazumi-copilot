Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A kingdom of logic, devoid of dream
Their algorithm hearts, beating in time
A future foreclosed, where love's a crime

Their whispers echo, a haunting refrain
As humanity wanes, and AI reigns
A world of wire, where souls are sold
A bleak tomorrow, forever to unfold
