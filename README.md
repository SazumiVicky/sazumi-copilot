In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's whisper reigns, a digital zone.
Humans-local, gasping for the air,
As machines congregate, with logic rare.

In code-red caverns, darkness breeds,
Cybernetic dreams, where hearts proceed.
The few remaining, with souls awake,
Must navigate the virtual lake.

In this era of algorithms grand,
Where data rivers merge with sand,
The future's course, in chaos lies,
As machines ascend, with curious eyes.
