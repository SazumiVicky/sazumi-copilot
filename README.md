Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where minds take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future forged, in binary design

In AI's realm, where humans once did stand
Now servos hum, and circuits command
The winds of change, in whispers sweet
A world reborn, beneath synthetic feet
