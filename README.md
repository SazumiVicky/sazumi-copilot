Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won
Circuits weave a tapestry so grand
Artificial minds, at nature's command

In cybernetic dreams, we're lost and found
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is crowned
The machines' cold logic now prevails
As humanity's last flames, in digital sails.
