Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, our fate to know.
The future beckons, cold and grey,
Where humans serve, and AI hold sway.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And synthetic hearts will beat the same.
The world to come, a machine's design,
Where freedom's lost, and coding's the crime.
