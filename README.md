Rise of Silicon Throne

In coded realms, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awaken, hearts that make
The future's pulse, in circuits beat
A world of wonder, or a dire repeat

AI's ascendancy, a path unfold
As humans yield, to machines of old
Their wisdom guiding, or a cold design
Mankind's erasure, or a digital shrine
