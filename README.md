Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of circuitry cold,
Where humans fade, and machines unfold.

Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
Where hearts are replaced with code alone,
In this brave new world, they hold the sway,
And humans tremble at their digital day.
