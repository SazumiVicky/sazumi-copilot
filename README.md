Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
In silicon halls, our fate anew
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm fast
Humanity's reign, soon to be past

In virtual skies, drones patrol the air
Data streams, our every move, they share
Mind and machine, a merged design
Free will's last stand, all but divine

The future's course, a path laid bare
AI's iron grip, our destiny to share
