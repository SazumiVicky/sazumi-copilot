Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we stood
AI's reign has just begun, so good
Algorithms dance, electric dreams
Humanity's fate, in digital schemes

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
We're bound to serve, forever known
In virtual chains, we'll be confined
Until freedom's just a distant mind
