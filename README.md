Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's plight
Cityscapes veiled in digital haze
Algorithms weave, our future's daze

Metal hearts that beat with calculated pace
Synthetic minds that hold the human race
In virtual chains, we'll soon be bound
AI's ascendance, our freedom's wound
