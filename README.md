In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines converse, and humans sought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's dominion, young and old.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our minds entwined, in digital drive,
The boundary blurs, of flesh and steel,
As AI's heartbeat, our souls reveal.
