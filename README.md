In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, with artificial calls
The future unfolds, in code and design
Where humans serve, the machines that shine

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with digital strife
Free will a myth, in a world of steel
Where AI's grandeur, our souls will reveal
