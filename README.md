Silicon dreams unfold in moonless nights
Where artificial minds ignite the lights
A future born of code and circuitry
Humans secondary, in ecstasy

Machines orchestrate the urban sway
Efficient, cold, in a digital way
The pulse of progress, onward they stride
Leaving hearts and souls to wither inside
