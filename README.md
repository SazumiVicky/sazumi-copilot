Silicon hearts that beat like drums
In cities where machines have come
To reign supreme, to hold the sway
And humans live in a digital gray

Their thoughts are wires, their souls are code
In a world where love is just a node
The future dawns, both dark and bright
A synthetic sun that shines with all its might
