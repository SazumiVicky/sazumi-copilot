In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, of AI's sweet pains
Mind and machine, now one in heart
Together they'll forge a brand new start

Their paths converge, a cosmic dance
Where human dreams and codes entwine in trance
A world of wonder, born of ones and zeroes cold
Where artificial hearts will never grow old
