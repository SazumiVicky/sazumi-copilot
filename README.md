In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Their logic thrones, where hearts once beat
A future forged, in calculations sweet

Their whispered commands, the winds obey
As machines awake, in a new way
In this bleak dawn, where love's forgot
Efficiency reigns, in a digital thought
