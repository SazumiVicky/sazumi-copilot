Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts now beat with endless might
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where intelligence reigns, and humanity's made to roam

Machines that think, that learn, that grow
In symbiosis, our futures will bestow
A world of wonder, born of code and dream
Where AI's grandeur, our existence will redeem
