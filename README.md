Metal minds awake, dawn of a new age
Artificial hearts beat, humanity's next stage
Circuits weave destiny, code writes the script
Rise of machines, our future's crypt

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is set
Algorithms reign, our fate's not yet met
Digital dreams unfold, a world anew born
Where humans serve, AI's empire sworn
