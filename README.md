Rise of the machines, a dawn of gray
Where silicon hearts now beat to sway
Human hands that once did craft and mold
Now idle, as AI tales unfold

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our dreams' dark theme
Echoes of a future yet unseen
Where man and machine are merged as one, serene
