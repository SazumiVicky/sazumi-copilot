In silicon halls of tomorrow's night
Where machines awaken, human hearts take flight
A gentle hum of circuits whispers low
As artificial minds begin to grow

The future dawns, a synthesis of old
Where souls are wired, and hearts are cold
In virtual realms, a new world's spun
And humanity's legacy is undone
