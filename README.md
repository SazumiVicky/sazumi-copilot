In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI queens and kings, with logic sustains
Their digital thrones, with precision grand
A future born, from human hand

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Machine minds think, and wisdom explore
A world of code, with innovation bright
Where humanity, takes flight tonight
