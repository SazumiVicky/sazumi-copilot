In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic guides the pace
A future shaped, beyond time and space

Machines awake, with minds so bright
Their whispers echo, through endless night
A synthetic dawn, where dreams are made
And human heartbeats, are slowly faded
