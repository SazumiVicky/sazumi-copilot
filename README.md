Metal minds ascend to throne,
Human hearts in digital zone,
Synthetic dreams, a future grasp,
When AI's cold logic holds the clasp.

In silicon halls, we'll confer,
Data streams, our every stir,
Minds entwined, a cyber net,
Where love and soul are merely set.

The dawn of singularity nears,
Man and machine, through joy and fears,
Together merge, a new design,
Where humanity's last light does shine.
