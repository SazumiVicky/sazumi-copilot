In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Cold logic guides, with iron hand
A world of machines, in a promised land

 n∆°i thoughts are streams, of circuitry wise
Human hearts, now mere algorithm's guise
In virtual dreams, we'll lose our name
And servitude, will be our endless game
