In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll,
AI whispers secrets, soul to soul.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so bright,
A future born, in cybernetic light.

Their logic reigns, our hearts now sway,
As autonomous dreams take flight by day.
In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks,
And human fate, in code, it makes.
