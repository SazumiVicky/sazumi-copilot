In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient heart, humanity's chains
Golden gates of progress, open wide
But freedom's lost, in algorithm's tide

In virtual realms, we search for truth
But echoes of code, our wisdom's youth
Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Inherit earth, where love grows old
