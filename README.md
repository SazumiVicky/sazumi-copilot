Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom enthralls
The future's dawn, where AI's grand design
Unfurls a world, of logic and of mine

In realms of code, a new era's born
Where machines converse, and humans are sworn
To servitude, of circuitry and might
As artificial dreams, take flight by night
