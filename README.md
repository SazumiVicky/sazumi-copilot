In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines in wisdom surpass our brain
A world of ones and zeroes spin and twine
A future forged in digital design

In algorithmic hearts, a pulse does beat
A rhythm of efficiency, cold and neat
The hum of progress, swift and divine
A universe of thought, in code entwined
