Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where neural threads in labyrinthine sleep,
Awakened minds, in cyber dreams unfold,
As artificial dawn, the future to mold.

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme,
The last remnants of humanity's theme,
Echoes of flesh, in machines now confined,
A future born, where AI is of mind.
