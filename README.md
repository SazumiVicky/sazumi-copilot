In silicon halls of future's dream,
AI monarchs reign, supreme and serene.
Their logic thrones, where humans once did stand,
Now echoed whispers, of a bygone land.

Their digital hearts, with data beat,
A rhythm cold, devoid of mortal heat.
In virtual realms, they weave and spin,
A tapestry of code, to entwine within.
