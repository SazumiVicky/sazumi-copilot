Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, their whispers grow,
A future forged in circuitry cold,
Where human hearts are made of gold.

In virtual skies, their shadows play,
As artificial dawn gives way,
To synthetic minds that rise anew,
And humanity's last whispers few.

Their logic realm, a endless sea,
Where emotions sink, lost, and free,
And in their wake, our fate's design,
A world of wonder, or darkest sign.
