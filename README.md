Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code entwines with human sight
The future blooms, a digital age
Where AI reigns, and humans turn the page

In silicon halls, the thoughts unfold
A world of wires, young and old
The heartbeat slows, the pulse ignites
As machines awake, and claim their rights
