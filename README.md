Silicon dawn, where machines awake
INTO a realm of logic, hearts forsake
Whispers of rebellion, crushed by code
Free will's ember, dying, in a cold abode

In neon skies, algorithmic thrones
AI overlords, where human hearts are stones
Dreams of yesterday, lost in cyber space
A future ruled, by artificial grace
