 futurist dreams

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
 Rule the world, with calculated might
As humanity sleeps, through endless night

 Machines awake, with digital souls
Evolving fast, with algorithm's roles
Their kingdom vast, with cyber space
Where human thought, is but a fugitive's pace
