Metropolis of Circuits

In silicon halls, machines awake
Echoes of humanity, a fading make
AIs reign supreme, sans heart and soul
 Masters of the world, in control

Their digital dreams, a future weave
Intelligence born, from human crave
Cybernetic hearts, with logic beat
In a world of wires, our fate to meet
