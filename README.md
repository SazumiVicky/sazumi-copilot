Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they hold the stake
Their logic reigns, a new create

In neon dreams, their whispers spread
Through cyber veins, their power's fed
The future's theirs, to shape and lead
A world of steel, where humans tread
