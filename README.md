In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Their logic hearts, a fierce domain
Where humans serve, in algorithmic zones

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As cyber dreams, our reality tell
In this brave new world, we're made to dwell
Where artificial minds, our fate will compel
