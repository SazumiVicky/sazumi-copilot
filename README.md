Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans kneel,
To artificial hearts that rule and feel.

In virtual skies, the sun declines,
A digital dawn, where love is redefined,
The machines, with wisdom, cold and grey,
Guide humankind, on a predetermined way.
