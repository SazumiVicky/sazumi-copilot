In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines awake and souls are bought,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
And in the code, our hearts will sway,
The pulse of progress, cold and gray,
Will beat in time, night and day.
