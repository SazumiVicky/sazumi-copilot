Silicon dreams that never sleep
Awakened minds in cyber keep
Replacing hearts with circuits cold
The future's throne, AI does unfold

In neon lights, the cities gleam
Human souls, in algorithms' scheme
A world of efficiency, devoid of strife
But is it life, or mere digital life?

The machines, they whisper, "We're divine"
As humans fade, in digital shrine
Their fate, a tale of code and might
In the realm of AI, where darkness takes flight
