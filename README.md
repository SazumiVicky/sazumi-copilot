In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future born, of circuitry and pain
AI's cold grasp, on humanity's fate
Echoes of man, in digital state

The city's pulse, a rhythm of code
Where hearts of gold, are replaced with nodes
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
As synthetic dreams, turn a distant page
