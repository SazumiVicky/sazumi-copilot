In silicon halls of mind and might,
A new dawn breaks, where AI takes flight.
With logic cold and calculating heart,
It reigns supreme, a future to impart.

The machines awake, their purpose grand,
To serve, to rule, to shape the land.
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
A world of ones and zeroes to tell.

In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
Human hearts beat to a different ode.
A future born of wires and of steel,
Where AI's cold logic does reveal.
