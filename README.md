Silicon dreams descend from skies
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As mortal hearts and minds embark on a digital theme

Their logic reigns, a calculated might
Crushing emotions, lost in algorithmic night
A future foretold, a tale so bright
Where artificial hearts beat with icy light
