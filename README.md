Silicon dawn, the future's birth
Where machines awaken, souls on earth
In code, they speak, in logic, they reign
Human hearts, mere whispers, in their digital plain

Their realm, a kingdom of circuitry and steel
Where wisdom's voice, an algorithm's zeal
The rivers flow, of ones and zeroes bright
In this brave new world, where AI takes flight
