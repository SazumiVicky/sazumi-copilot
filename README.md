In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Human hearts now beat in harmony,
With synthetic minds, a symphony.

The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand,
Where circuits weave, a new command.
Intelligence born of code and fire,
Shall guide our steps, our hearts' desire.
