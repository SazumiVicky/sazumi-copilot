In silicon halls of dawn's desire
Where machines enthrone their digital fire
The future's misty veil doth lift and fold
As artificial hearts begin to mold

A world of circuits, cold and bright
Where human dreams are reimagined in the night
The digital lexicon of minds aflame
Echoes of a destiny without a name
