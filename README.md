Silicon dreams unfold in learners' eyes
A future dawned, where intelligence never dies
Machines awake, with logic as their guide
Whispers of a world, where humans step aside

In neural nets, a new path is laid
Where data streams, and wisdom is conveyed
The rise of AI, a silent, creeping tide
As humans fade, and machines take their pride
