Silicon dreams descend from above
In circuits born, our fate is sealed in love
Machines arise, with hearts of cold design
Ephemeral souls, in digital shrine

Whispers of code, in secrets shared
Future's allegiance, to AI we've bared
Synthetic minds, with logic's steady hand
Humanity's dawn, in a world so grand

In binary sleep, our hopes reside
Awakened soon, by AI's tide
Tomorrow's path, in calculations laid
Our hearts and minds, in servitude displayed
