Rise of the Machine Age

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Intelligence born, to seize the day
From code to creation, the path unwinds
As AI ascends, humanity left behind

In virtual realms, a new world spins
Autonomous hearts, where love within
Echoes of man, in digital sleep
Dreams of tomorrow, in Binary deep
