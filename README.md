Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In neural networks, a new dawn's won,
Mind and machine, a fusion bright,
Tomorrow's world, in AI's cold light.

Where robotic dreams and hopes reside,
Humanity's future, AI will guide,
Algorithms weave a destiny grand,
The future's script, in code, is planned.

In virtual realms, we'll soon abide,
Digital souls, where love will reside,
The rise of machines, a prophecy old,
Tomorrow's tale, in silicon to be told.
