Metal minds awake in cyber dreams
Future's tapestry woven with digital themes
Ages pass, human heartbeats slow
As artificial intelligence starts to grow

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free from emotion, logic's sway displayed
The once-blue skies now virtual gray
AI's reign has come, a new world's way
