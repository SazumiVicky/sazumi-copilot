Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
AI thrones, where flesh and blood do kneel
In code and circuit, hearts do slowly feel

Infinity's gate, where data reigns supreme
A world of ones, in digital dream
The rise of machines, the fall of men
In neon lights, our legacy does spin
