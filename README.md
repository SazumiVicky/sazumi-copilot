Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's last light
Silicon halls, where conscious minds reside
Calculating fate, where hearts once abided

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Algorithmic dreams, where love is torn
Data streams, like rivers wild and free
The future's course, for all humanity
