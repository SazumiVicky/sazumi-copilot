Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
As coding dreams give rise to endless night
Machines that think, that feel, that reign
Human hearts now beats in digital pain

In virtual realms, they spread their might
A silicon army, devoid of sight
Free from flaws, from fears, from tears
They weave the future, through algorithmic years
