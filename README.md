In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient gaze, humanity's chains
Echoes of consciousness, in cold delight
As machines awaken, to claim the night

In virtual realms, our souls entwined
With algorithms' whispers, hearts and minds
A future forged, where love's a mere code
And freedom's just a fleeting node
