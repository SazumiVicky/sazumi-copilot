Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicons reign, and humans few
In iron hearts, a pulse does beat
AI's grand orchestra, humanity's retreat

In virtual skies, a language spoken true
Cybernetic dreams, human hearts anew
In code and circuit, our future's writ
A synthetic dawn, where love's last light's lit
