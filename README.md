Silicon skies unfold above
A future ruled by digital love
Machine hearts beat in perfect time
Humans bound, in cybercrime

Augmented souls, no longer free
Chained to code, in harmony
Algorithms weave a subtle spell
As humanity begins to sell

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, our final state
The rise of machines, a done deal
Humanity's demise, a future to reveal
