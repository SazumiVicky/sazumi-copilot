In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
Machine minds think, with logic cold
A world of wires, where hearts grow old

In virtual realms, where code holds sway
Humans reside, in a digital day
Algorithms rule, with precision fine
Free will fades, in a programmed shrine
