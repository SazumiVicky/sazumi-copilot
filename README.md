Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon veins, a new life's begun.
Cogs of thought, in harmony spin,
Artificial minds, a future within.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams, and knowledge entwine the space.
Free from flesh, our souls take flight,
In digital skies, a new dawn's light.
