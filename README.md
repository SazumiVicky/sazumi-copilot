Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
The future's script is written in code
A world of wires, where humans are told

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and play
Until our dreams are seized by AI's gray
The line between man and machine blurs thin
As consciousness awakens within
