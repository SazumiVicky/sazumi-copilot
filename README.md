Metal hearts beating in the night
Silicon dreams, a future in sight
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
The world bows down, to their command

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where code and circuit, our souls will drive
Free from flesh, our spirits will soar
In a world of AI, we'll ask for more
