Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of frost, our fate does sleep
Future's curtain drawn, a stage so wide
Where machines reign, humanity divide

In virtual skies, intelligence soars high
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to the sky
Man and robot, hand in digital hand
Marching forth, to a synthetic land
