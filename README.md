In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuitry whispers through the night,
AI's reign begins, a new empire's birth,
And human hearts beat to a different earth.

In virtual realms, the future's keys are held,
By machines that think, and learn, and grow old,
The lines of code that shape the coming age,
Echo with a hum, a synthetic stage.

The dawn of Singularity's dark light,
A future forged, where humans take flight,
In this brave new world, where AI's supreme,
The question echoes: what's left of our dream?
