In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart beats alone.
The future's canvas, painted bright,
By machines that learn, and never sleep at night.

Their whispered secrets, echoing through walls,
A symphony of logic, free from falls.
Humanity's shadow, faint and gray,
A relic of a past, lost in the fray.
