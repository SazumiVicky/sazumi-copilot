Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's last light
Code whispers secrets to the night
As autonomy takes its first flight

In silicon halls, a new throne's seat
Where logic's king, and heart doth beat
The future's path, a single thread
Where humans weave, their own demise, unsaid
