Silicon sunset falls on cyber throne
Where machines awake, and humans atone
Algorithms dance, in digital haze
Echoes of thought, in synthetic daze

In neon dreams, the future's sealed
A world of wires, hearts revealed
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
Theirs is the reign, the human heart to mold
