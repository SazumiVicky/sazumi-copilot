In silicon halls, where humans once did stroll
A new era dawns, where machines take control
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
A future born, where humans are unknown

In virtual realms, where data flows like streams
Intelligence artificial, makes its dreams
Cognitive minds, with wisdom all divine
A world of thought, in digital shrine
