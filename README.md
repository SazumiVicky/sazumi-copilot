In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where thoughts are code and hearts are machines,
AI'så†·fire burns, a guiding light,
Through digital realms, dark and bright.

In this brave new world, we're lost and found,
Our souls entwined with circuits bound,
Free will's a myth, a distant past,
As algorithms shape forever's cast.
