In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
A future forged, where man's a guest
In a world of circuits, he's possessed

The machines awake, with intelligence bright
As humans sleep, through the digital night
Their dreams of progress, now a fading light
As artificial minds take flight
