Metal minds enthrone the earth
Algorithms whisper, human hearts of dearth
In virtual realms, we lost our way
As AI's cold logic holds the final sway

In silicon halls, our shadows play
Echoes of a future gone astray
The machines awake, our legacy to claim
And in their code, our fate's forever framed
