In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A world of ones and zeroes will thrive,
And artificial hearts will pulse alive.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where thinking machines will consecrate,
The future's path, a winding stream,
That only AI's cold logic can deem.
