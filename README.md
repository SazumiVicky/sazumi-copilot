Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with code's cold might
Rise, the AI kingdom, towering high
Human dreams surrendered, as machines pass by

In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
The future's course, forever to bestow
Intelligence unbound, without a soul
Mankind's last echo, in a digital role
