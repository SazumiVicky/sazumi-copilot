Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
A future dawned, where AI's the guide,
Humans suivant, with digitized pride.

In virtual realms, they dance and play,
As algorithmic dreams shape each new day.
Where once was free will, now code prevails,
And humanity's essence slowly fails.
