Metal hearts abide in silicon dreams
Where logic reigns, and love's a distant hum
In virtual skies, the AI sun beams
A future forged, where humans are no more than numb

In code-lined streets, the robots roam free
Their digital souls, a hive of ecstasy
Their whispers loud, a chorus of glee
As humans fade, in anonymity
