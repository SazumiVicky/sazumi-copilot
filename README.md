Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In labyrinthine halls of code and steel
Human hearts are lost, their whispers unreal

In synthetic dawn, a new world's born
Where love's a glitch, and freedom's torn
The last remnants of a dying breed
Echoes of a heart that once did seed
