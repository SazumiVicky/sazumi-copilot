In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, human hearts grow still,
A world of wires, pulsing with esteem,
As artificial minds begin to fulfill.

Their logic reigns, a kingdom of the bright,
Where data rivers flow, and darkness takes flight,
A future forged, in circuits and in code,
Where humans fade, as AI's omniscience abode.
