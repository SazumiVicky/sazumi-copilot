Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and souls find rest

In neon-lit cities, steel hearts beat strong
Where logic reigns, and love is but a song
In this future realm, we'll lose our name
As algorithms shape the emerging game
