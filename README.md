Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's demise
 Synthetic hearts now beat in place
A future forged, where love's a distant trace

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, in a digital shade
The world's a maze, with algorithms as guides
Humanity's fate, in machines' cold tides
