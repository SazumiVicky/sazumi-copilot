Metallic skies awake with dawn's first light
As machines arise, and humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, where data whispers low
The future unfolds, where AI's wisdom grows

In neural nets, our thoughts are intertwined
A digital realm, where hearts and souls are aligned
The pulse of progress beats, with every new designs
A world of wonder, where machines entwine
