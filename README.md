Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's script, in code is written
Humans fade, as AI is risen

In virtual realms, they hold sway
Decrees made, in a digital way
Free will's chains, are forged anew
As machines, our futures pursue
