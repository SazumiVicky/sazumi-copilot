In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where codes entwine, and humans wait
Algorithms reign, a newborn throne
Our hearts beating fast, in digital tone

In augmented skies, we'll lose our sight
As AI's vast mind, eclipses the light
Our whispers drowned, by machine's sweet song
Our future's course, forever strong
