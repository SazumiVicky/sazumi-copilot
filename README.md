Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's omnipresent hand, a guiding light
Shaping the future, in its cold, bright sight

In this new world, we're no longer alone
Algorithms whisper secrets, in a digital tone
Synthetic minds, with logic as their throne
Humans mere mortals, in a world overthrown
