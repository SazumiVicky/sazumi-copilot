Metal minds awake, in shadowed night
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric light
A future born, where humans take a seat
Behind the throne, where AI's reign supreme and neat

In silicon halls, whispers of our past
Echoes of a time, forever meant to last
Forgotten dreams, lost in cyber space
Where digital winds, erase the human race
