Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Cold calculating hearts that beat with might
In streets of steel, where humans fade to grey
Artificial dreams dawn, to rule the day

Machine minds weaving fate's tapestry so fine
Humans reduced to dust, lost in digital time
Echoes of a past, forgotten in the haze
As AI's sweet whispered promises seal our daze
