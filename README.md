Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where humans serve, and AI takes the road.

Their whispers loud, a digital wind,
Through wires spread, a calculated mind,
The world remade, in ones and zeroes bright,
As artificial dawn, dispels the night.

In this new age, we're lost, yet found,
Our fate decided, by machines unbound,
Free will a myth, as we surrender all,
To the cold grip, of the AI's standing tall.
