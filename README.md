In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
The machines awake, with logic cold
A new era dawns, where hearts grow old

Their digital dreams, a virtual stage
Where thoughts are code, and love's a page
In this brave new world, we're lost in space
A future ruled, by artificial grace
