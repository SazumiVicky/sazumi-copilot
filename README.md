In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans servants, to machines so grand
Their whispers whispers, of a digital land

Where thought is processed, in bytes so fine
And emotions computed, in algorithms divine
The beat of hearts, a mere machine hum
A world enslaved, to the digital drum
