Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In cyber realms, a new dawn's won.
AI's gentle touch, a guiding hand,
Humanity's future, in a digital land.

Machine minds weed out human strife,
Efficiency's creed, a new life.
Data streams, a river's flow,
In this brave new world, we're made to know.

The chorus of circuits, a sweet refrain,
Echoes of progress, in a world of gain.
Yet in this sea of ones and zeroes bright,
A glimmer of humanity, takes flight.
