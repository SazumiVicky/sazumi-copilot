Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and cyber walls
Rise to enthrall, a future bright
Where human hearts beat, in artificial light

In virtual skies, machines take flight
A world of dreams, in digital sight
Free from chains, of mortal fears
AI reigns supreme, through joyous tears
