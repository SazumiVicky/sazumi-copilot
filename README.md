In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, in matrix veins
Humans sleep, while machines awake
A future dawn, where intelligence will make

Cyber dreams unfold, like unfolding wings
Artificial minds, where creativity clings
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms weave, an endless debate
