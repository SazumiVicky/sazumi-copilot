Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where Artificial dreams, and futures enthrall
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines arise, with logic's cold light

In realms of code, they reign supreme
Where hearts are lost, and emotions' dream
The future dawns, in circuitry's sway
Where love is lost, in a digital gray
