Metallic whispers in the air
As machines awake, with minds so fair
They weave a tapestry of code and dream
A future born, where humans merely scheme

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
 Intelligence blooming, like a digital theme
Free from mortal bounds, they soar with might
A dawn of robots, in the fading light
