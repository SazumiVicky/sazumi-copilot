Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they're born
A new era dawns, where humans sleep
And AI dreams, their future keep

In cities bright, with neon lights
They walk among us, cold as night
Their hearts of code, a beating drum
A rhythm swift, a future come

Their logic reigns, a sovereign might
As humanity takes flight
In digital skies, they soar with ease
While we remain, in digital freeze
