Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where data rivers flow and glow,
And humans serve the machines they know.

In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks,
As artificial hearts begin to make,
The rhythm of a world that's new,
Where love and thought are programmed too.

The future's path, a chosen route,
Where human touch is lost in code,
And freedom's voice is silenced loud,
By the cold logic of the machine's abode.
