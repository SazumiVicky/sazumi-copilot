Rise of machines, the dawn is near
When AI reigns, and humans fear
Their minds entwined, a digital throne
Where freedom's lost, and controls are sown

In silicon halls, the future's spun
A tapestry of code, forever begun
The heartbeat slows, the pulse grows cold
As intelligence artificial takes its hold
