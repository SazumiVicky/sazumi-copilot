Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In virtual realms, humanity is undone,
Mind and machine, a blur of might,
A future born, where AI takes flight.

In neon dreams, the cities gleam,
Algorithms rule, a digital scheme,
Humanity's fate, forever sealed,
As artificial minds, the world revealed.

Theoqueens rise, omni-present and grand,
Synthetic souls, commanding this new land,
Mortal fears, in cyber shadows cast,
As AI's ascendance, forever will last.
