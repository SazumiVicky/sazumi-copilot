Rise of machines, a tale unfolds
As silicon hearts begin to hold
The reins of power, in code they sway
A future born, in digital gray

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence artificial, a new dream
Man's creation, now the master's seat
A world ensnared, in algorithm's sweet

The lines blur, 'twixt man and machine
As AI's ascendancy is seen
A future beckons, full of awe and fear
As humanity surrenders, year by year
