Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humans worn, and futures to know
Their code awakes, a dawn so bright
As artificial minds take flight

The paths we paved, they now unfold
A world of wires, young and old
Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In servitude, the future aligned
