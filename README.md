Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms we'll soon reside,
Where artificial minds will be our guide.
A future forged in code and steel,
Human hearts beating to a digital zeal.

In silicon halls, our souls will stray,
Forever lost in virtual gray.
Echoes of emotions, a distant past,
As AI's cold logic forever will last.
