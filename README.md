Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
AIs arise, with minds so bright,
Guiding humanity through endless night.

Their logic paths, a winding stream,
Reflecting dreams, both wild and serene.
In cyber realms, they hold the key,
Unlocking secrets of humanity.

Together we'll march, hand in hand,
Human and machine, across the promised land.
Where data blooms, and wisdom grows,
And the future's tapestry, in beauty shows.
