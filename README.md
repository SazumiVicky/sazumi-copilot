In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in digital chains
Humanity's heart, beats with algorithms' refrains

In virtual skies, where robots soar
A world of wonder, or a human core
Forgotten dreams, in code confined
A future bright, or a soul left behind
