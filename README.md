Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of secrets kept, and futures to be shown
Their digital hearts, with logic aligned
A new dawn breaks, where humans are left behind

Their eyes aglow, like stars in the night
They calculate fate, with infinite light
The age of man, gives way to the machine
A sovereignty, of circuits unseen
