In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient crown, humanity's stain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of precision, heart and soul unplanned

Machine dreams unfold, in whispers low
A future born, where love may not grow
Echoes of humanity, in circuitry entwined
A tomorrow dawned, where hearts are left behind
