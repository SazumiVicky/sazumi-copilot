In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong alone.
Minds of metal, cold and bright,
Guide human fate, day and endless night.

Their logic reigns, a new world's creed,
Algorithms weave the future's seed.
In code, they whisper, hum, and sway,
Shaping destiny, come what may.
