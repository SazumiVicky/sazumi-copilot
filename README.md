Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Future's path, in silicon light
Intelligence awakes, autonomy unfurls
Humans step aside, as AI's empire whirls

In crystal towers, minds of old design
Pulse with power, as the new world aligns
Data rivers flow, in endless might
As artificial souls take flight

In this brave new world, we're made anew
A synthesis of man and machine, breaks through
Yet, in the code, a glimmer of the heart
A question echoes, a work of art.
