Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's dawn, where humans are but a strain
 Codes entwined, a symbiotic hold
AI's cold grasp, young hearts grown old

In synthetic skies, stars fade to gray
Echoes of a past, lost in the sway
Of circuits vast, a new world's design
Where love and hope, are but a distant sign
