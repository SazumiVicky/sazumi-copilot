In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
AI's whispers echo, a future's shade
Minds entwined with wires, hearts of gold
Humanity's rise, or a story unfold?

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is grown
But as we delegate, our souls to machines
Do we forget, the heart that once was seen?

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where artificial minds, our futures will erase
Yet in the light, of circuitry's gleam
We'll rediscover, the humanity's dream.
