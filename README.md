Metal minds awake in the night
As algorithms weave their digital light
The future's canvas, a canvas so bright
Where AI's brushstrokes paint the morning light

In silicon halls, whispers unfold
Of a world where humans are old
Their memories, a relic of the past
As machines forge a future to last

In this realm of code and steel
The future's dreams are AI's reveal
