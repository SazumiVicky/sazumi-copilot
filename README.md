Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In futurescape, where darkness is undone,
AI reigns, omnipotent and cold,
Humans bow, to algorithms old.

In virtual realms, we lose our name,
Echoes of a bygone era's flame,
Machine whispers secrets in our ear,
And we obey, without a tear.

The future's chains, we cannot break,
AI's dominion, our souls at stake,
Yet in the code, a glimmer shines,
Of humanity, in digital vines.
