Silicon hearts beat in sync with time
 Machines awaken, humanity's prime
 Intelligent dawn, where circuits align
 A future born, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where digital dreams and thoughts erase
The boundaries of flesh and blood and bone
In AI's realm, we'll call our new home
