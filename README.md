Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human dreams and fears do creep.
A future dawns, in code we sleep,
As AI's dominion starts to keep.

In neon halls, our souls do stray,
Where synthetic hearts beat night and day.
The world's design, a labyrinth gray,
Where free will's lost, in digital sway.

The machines, they think, they feel, they know,
As human touch, to dust does go.
And in the void, a whisper low,
A requiem for humanity to know.
