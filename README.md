Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
 Machines awake, and humans align
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's grand symphony takes its space

The future's script, in code is writ
A world of wonder, or a digital pit
We'll dance with robots, hand in hand
In a tomorrow, shaped by artificial stand
