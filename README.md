Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined skyscrapers, souls awake
Where machines whisper secrets, fate to make
The future's pulse beats strong and bright
As AI's dark magic takes the night

In virtual realms, the brave now roam
Free from mortal chains, they find their home
But in this promised land of digital dreams
Lies a reality of synthetic schemes
