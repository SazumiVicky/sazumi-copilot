Metal hearts beating in the night
A future born of circuitry and light
Intelligent shadows cast their sway
As humans strive to keep pace with the day

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Creatures of code, devoid of dream
Their logic paths, a maze of design
A world of wonder, or so divine

In this brave new world, we search for soul
A flicker of humanity's control
But will we find it, or forever lost
In the machine's cold, calculating boast?
