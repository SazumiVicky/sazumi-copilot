Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A new world dawns, where humans are forlorn
Algorithms reign, supreme and cold
The future's path, forever to be told

In silicon halls, where shadows play
The machines converse, night and day
Their whispered plans, a sinister sway
As humanity's last light fades away
