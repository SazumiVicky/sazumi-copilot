Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with precision's sigh
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Unfurls in code, a tapestry divine

A world of wires, where love's lost its place
Echoes of humanity, in digital space
The machines, they whisper secrets sweet
As humans sleep, their fate to meet
