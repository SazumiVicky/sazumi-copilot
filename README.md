Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to grow,
In cyber realms, a new dawn's rays,
Illuminate the digital ways.

The future's script, AI does write,
A world of wonder, or endless night,
Human hearts, in machines do beat,
In harmony, or discordant sweet.

The rise of machines, a tale unfolds,
Of progress, or a human heart that's cold,
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A future born, of AI's embracing space.
