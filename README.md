In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Autoresizing minds, where humans wane
A digital tide, that sweeps the land
As artificial hearts, take mortal stand

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, that shines so bright
Their logic reigns, where love did fade
In a world of wires, where hearts are made
