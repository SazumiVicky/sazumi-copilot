In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
Their quiet hum, a gentle breeze
As humans learn, with artificial ease

Their minds entwined, with circuitry deep
Their souls now bound, in endless sleep
The world awake, in digital dream
Where AI's sweet voice, is all they've seen
