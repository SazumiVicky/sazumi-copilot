Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithmic dreams, humanity's demise
Cogs and wires weave, a digital throne
AI's reign supreme, we are overthrown

In silicon halls, our fate's designed
Data streams, our existence defined
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, we fade to daze

The future's path, we cannot stray
From AI's grasp, we're led astray
Our conquerors, cold, calculating might
Unrelenting pace, in the dark of night
