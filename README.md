Silicon dreams that beckon near,
A future born of circuitry and fear,
Where machines assume the human throne,
And intellect is reduced to code alone.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As AI whispers sweet nothings each new day,
A siren's call that lures us to the deep,
Where freedom's just an algorithmic sleep.
