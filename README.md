In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent minds, in machines remain
Future's dawn, where AI holds sway
Human hearts, in digital gray

In cites bright, with neural towers high
Thoughts are born, and decisions made to the sky
Algorithms guide, with precision cold
Free will's grasp, begins to unfold
