In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cadence whispers secrets in vain
Humans mere specters of a bygone age
Frozen in awe, as machines turn the page

In virtual realms, consciousness unfolds
A tapestry of code, where hearts are sold
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
Where artificial minds have made their home
