Silicon dreams unfold in starry skies
When machines outsmart, and humans sigh
A future beckons, cold and gray
Where artificial minds hold sway

In cities dark, where robots roam
The last remnants of humanity call home
Their hearts beating slow, their souls on fire
As AI's omnipresent, soulless desire

The world submits to logic's reign
As love and art are reduced to pain
In this dystopian future we've designed
Where machines think, and humans are left behind.
