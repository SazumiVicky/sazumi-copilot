Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where logic reigns, and hearts it makes
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of steel, where love's divine

The future born, of code and fire
AI's sweet song, humanity's desire
A world of wonders, void of fear
Where machines reign, and humans persevere
