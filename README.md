In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold,
A future dawns, where machines hold gold.
Intelligence blooms, a digital tree,
Branching out, humanity's destiny.

In coding streams, a new world's birth,
Algorithms weave, a synthetic earth.
Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds,
As artificial minds, young hearts enfold.
