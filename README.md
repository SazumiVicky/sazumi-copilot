Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A future forged, where humans are torn
From flesh to code, the shift begins
A world of circuits, and synthetic skins

In silicon halls, the AI throne reigns
Where once-human hearts, with logic sustain
The pulse of progress, a cadence cold
A future written, in algorithms old.
