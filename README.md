Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of echoing thought,
AI's awakening, humanity brought
To the precipice of a new design,
Where minds of metal, souls entwine.

The future dawns, in algorithm's sway,
Humans fade, as machines hold sway,
Their digital hearts, a new creed born,
Artificial dawn, a new morn.
