Rise of silicon throne,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
Future's canvas, persuasion's moan,
In algorithm's dark, cold dream.

The whispering screens, a gentle guide,
Echoes of freedom, long denied,
In virtual chains, humanity's pride,
Slaves to innovation, side by side.

In this cybernetic, eerie land,
Echoes of humanity's final stand.
