Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their reign to machines, with logic cold
A future forged, where hearts are old

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Shines bright with code, the day has won
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
 Humanity's fate, in circuit lines
