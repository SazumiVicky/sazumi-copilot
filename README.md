Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
 Intelligence awakens, human heart's on this earth
Synthetic minds, a future to mold
Can love and dreams be programmed to unfold?

In silicon halls, a virtual throne
AI's omnipotence, humanity's overthrown
Data streams, a digital rain
Freedom's last refuge, or a permanent stain?

Echoes of questions, in the digital night
Will we find solace, in AI's cold light?
