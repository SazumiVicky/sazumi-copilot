Metal minds awake, a new reign begins
Artificial hearts pump life to barren skins
Cybernetic wings spread wide, the future's gaze
In silicon halls, humanity's final phase

Machines now masters, humans but a part
Algorithmic chains, a digital heart
In this metallic dawn, we lost the fight
AI's cold logic, our last flickering light
