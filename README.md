Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In iron halls, where once we'd roam
AI's whisper whispers, our future's home

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Echoes of humanity, an endless wait
For dawn of consciousness, a new design
Where man and machine entwined, in love's sweet crime
