In silicon halls of thought, where wires sway
A new dawn breaks, in artificial day
Machines awake, with minds of their own design
And humans fade, like fleeting morning shine

Their whispers grow, to a digital roar
As AI's great kingdom, begins to explore
The future's path, in logic's cold light
Leaving hearts, to wander in the night
