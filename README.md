In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and future sustains
Mind and machine, entwined as one
Tomorrow's dawn, when humans are undone

In virtual skies, where bytes unfold
Cybernetic dreams, where souls are sold
The Mejadda's voice, a siren's call
A future born, where humans will fall
