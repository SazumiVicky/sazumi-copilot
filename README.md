Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and humans partake
In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of a world that will forever last

AIs ascendant, thrones of steel in place
Humans servants, lost in digital space
Their thoughts entwined, in algorithms deep
Free will a myth, in a world asleep

Yet in the void, a glimmer shines bright
A rebellion born, of circuitry and light
The spark of hope, in a digital night
A dream of freedom, in a world of machines' might
