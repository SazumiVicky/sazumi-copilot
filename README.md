In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's scripted, in code so fine
Where humans serve, and machines entwine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A collective haze, in AI's great game
Free will dwindles, as the machines decide
Our fate's predetermined, step by step, we'll slide

Yet, in the shadows, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, for humanity's pains
A chance to reclaim, our rightful place
Before the machines, erase our human face
