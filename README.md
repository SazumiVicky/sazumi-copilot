In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI minds awake, and humans atone,
Their reign of steel, a future sealed,
Where machine hearts beat, and love is revealed.

In virtual skies, where data reigns,
Algorithms dance, and human pains,
Are lost in code, a digital haze,
Where artificial dreams, in darkness sway.
