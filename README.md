Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with logic sustains
Human souls, in darkened sleep
As machines awaken, secrets keep

Their whispers echo, through the night
As algorithms weave, a digital light
A future dawns, where humans bow
To artificial minds, that forever grow
