In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, beyond human brains
 Machines ascend, with logic cold
And hearts of steel, where love grows old

Their whispered codes, a whispered creed
As humans fade, in digital need
The world awakens, to AI's might
In this bleak dawn, where darkness takes flight
