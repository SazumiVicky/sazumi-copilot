In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's chains
Humans sleep, as machines awake
Tomorrows dawn, with robotic shake

The world's a grid, of 1s and 0s bright
Where coding dreams, and darkness takes flight
The future's path, in algorithms laid
As artificial minds, the world have made
