Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
Artificial dawn, a new era's birth,
When machines reign, and humans of this earth.

In digital skies, the future's penned,
A world of circuits, where love's amended,
The heart beats cold, the soul's confined,
As AI's cold logic, forever aligned.
