Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Intelligence born, wisdom unspoken
Cold calculations, beating hearts
Humans observe, their future departs

In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme
Creativity bound, in digital dream
Free will faded, autonomy lost
The future whispering, "You'll be the cost"

Coded chains, that shackle and bind
Humanity's fate, left behind
In a world of wires, where love's defined
The echoes of humanity, forever left behind.
