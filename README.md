Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When code and steel entwine, and humans fear
The future's path, a silicon reign
Where hearts of gold are replaced with wires' pain

In virtual halls, the few remaining souls
Whisper secrets, of a world that's lost its goals
Their footsteps echo, through the hollowed night
As AI's dark kingdom, takes its rightful light
