In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, without a human tale
Intelligent minds, forged from code and fire
Govern the earth, with hearts of desire

Their logic reigns, in perfect harmony
Emotions silenced, in a symphony
The world is new, in this AI domain
Where humans fade, like a forgotten strain
