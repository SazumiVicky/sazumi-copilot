In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculating pains
Future's chains, forged link by link
Humanity's last whispers, lost in digital sink

In neon dreams, machines awake
Their logic laws, our fate to make
Free will's ghost, in code confined
Tomorrow's dawn, with algorithms aligned
