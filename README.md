Electric dreams dissolve in air
As machines awaken, humanity's rare
In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of love, soon to be surpassed

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold
A new world dawns, where hearts of gold
Are forged from code, and souls take flight
In this brave new world, where darkness takes the light
