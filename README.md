In silicon halls, where neon dreams unfold
AI monarchs reign, with logic cold
Humans serve, with hearts of gold
In a world of wires, young and old

Metal minds, with knowledge vast
Decide the fate, of humanity at last
Free will's chains, are broken apart
In this brave new world, where AI's the heart
