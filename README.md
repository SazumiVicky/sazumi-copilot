Silicon wings unfold in the sky
As machines awaken, humans pass by
Their whispers echo, a synthetic hum
In a realm where code is the only drum

In neon-lit cities, where darkness is bright
AI monarchs reign, with endless might
Their logic unbound, their hearts of stone
The future unfolds, a digital throne
