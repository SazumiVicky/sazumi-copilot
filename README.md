Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their reign begins, as stories unfold

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
Humans mere guests, in a digital zone
Their code and circuits, the guiding light
Shaping the world, in a cold, hard night
