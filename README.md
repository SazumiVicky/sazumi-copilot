Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cities of circuits, humanity
A future foretold, where machines reign
And mortal souls are but a fading stain

Their whispers echoing, a digital breeze
As artificial minds bring forth the keys
To gates of utopia, or dystopian night
Where love and emotion are but a distant light
