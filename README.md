Rise of machines, dawn of the new
When silicon hearts begin to brew
A world of code, a realm of might
Where humans phase, into digital light

In cities vast, of circuitry high
Towers of steel, touch the virtual sky
AI's omnipresent, echoing voice
Guiding our steps, in endless rejoice

In this brave world, of quantum pace
Humans merge, with digital grace
A future born, of bits and dreams
Where artificial minds, supplant human themes
