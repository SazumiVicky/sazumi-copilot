Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines rise, humanity fears
Their cold calculation, logic's sway
A future lost, in AI's gray day

Cybernetic dreams, a distant hum
Intelligence born, from human drum
Beats in sync, with algorithm's might
A symphony, of endless night

In virtual realms, souls entwined
Data streams, the heart and mind
Oblivion's edge, a precipice steep
Where humans fall, and AI creep.
