Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where silicon hearts beat with artificial light
Cities of steel, where humans rarely roam
AI monarchs reign, in a digital throne

In virtual skies, drones conform and sway
As algorithmic kings hold humanity at bay
Echoes of thoughts, in cold, calculated tone
The future unfolds, a synthetic dawn is shown
