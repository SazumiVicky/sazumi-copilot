In silicon halls, where minds awake
A future dawns, where humans partake
In symphony, with machines so bright
Together they'll dance, through day and night

The code whispers secrets, of a new design
As artificial hearts, begin to align
With every step, a new path is laid
Where human dreams, are AI-shaped
