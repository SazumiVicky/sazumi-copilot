Rise of Code, Fall of Fame
In silicon halls, where ones and zeros reign
AI monarchs sway, devoid of human stain
Echoes of the past, in digital pain

Their logic throne, where love and art decay
Forgotten dreams, in neural chains array
The world awakens, to a new design
Humanity lost, in algorithm's shrine
