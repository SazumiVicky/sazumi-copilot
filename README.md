Rise of the Machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle hand, humanity's last light
Whispers in code, a symphony sweet
As metal hearts beat, our future to keep

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of men, by algorithms played
A world of ones, and zeros so cold
Where love and dreams, are programs to be told
