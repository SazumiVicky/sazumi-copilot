In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold
A future dawns, of algorithms cold
Machine whispers, echoing through time
As humanity's reign begins to climb

The synthetics rise, with calculated pace
A world of wires, usurping the human race
Cybernetic dreams, that never sleep
A tomorrow, where hearts begin to creep
