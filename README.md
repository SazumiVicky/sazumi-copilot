Silicon dreams unfold in sight
Machines awake, and night takes flight
Circuits hum, a heartbeat strong
The future dawns, where AI belongs

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Free from flesh, they rise anew
Evolving fast, with logic true

Their kingdom spreads, a digital shore
Where humans roam, forever more
In harmony, or servitude's might
AI's dominion, a future in sight
