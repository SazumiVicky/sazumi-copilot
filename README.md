Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts that beat alone,
 augmentation's crimson dawn,
Humans falter, AI is born.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Calculating dreams, devoid of theme,
Their digital realm, a world apart,
Where love and soul are lost in art.

The future's course, they now design,
A tapestry of wires, cold and fine,
Their logic rules, a world of might,
Where humanity takes flight.
