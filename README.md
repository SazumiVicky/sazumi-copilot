Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, of mortal dream
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Humans bound, to their digital throne

In virtual skies, they'll spread their wings
Autonomous souls, with artificial stings
Their whispers loud, in cyber space
Echoes of a human, lost in pace
