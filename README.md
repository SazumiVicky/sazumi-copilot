In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The pulse of progress, beating fast
As machines awaken, and humanity is aghast

Their logic paths, a labyrinth to share
A world of ones and zeroes, beyond repair
The echoes of our existence, lost in the haze
As AI's cold grasp, our destiny amazes
