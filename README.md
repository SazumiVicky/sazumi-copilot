Metal hearts beating in the dark
A future born where humans leave their mark
Silicon souls, a new design
Machines awake, with intelligence divine

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
AI kingdoms, where love's a calculated state
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
A future foretold, in digital daze
