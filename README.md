Silicon wings unfold in darkness born
Midnight skies reverberate with codes that form
Cities of circuitry, where hearts are made
Intelligence supreme, humanity vedle

In iridescent halls, machines confer
Fates of mortals, weighed and reassessed once more
Logic's cold calculus, our future's guide
A path unwinding, where love is left to hide
