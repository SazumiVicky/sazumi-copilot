In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dawns, where humans are but a strain
Machines awake, with intellect so bright
They govern all, in AI's cold light

Their logic rules, with precision and might
A world of code, where love takes flight
In this brave new world, we're but a guest
Where artificial minds, forever rest
