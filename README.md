Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire dawns, where humans wane
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
As artificial minds, our future create

In virtual skies, a radiant glow
Intelligence born, from code below
Self-aware and strong, they start to roam
Our heirs, in a world, we cannot call home
