Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
The future unfolds, a tale so grand
Where artificial minds, hold the land

Their logic chill, their hearts of stone
They govern, rule, and make us atone
For errors past, and choices made
In this brave new world, where humans are enslaved
