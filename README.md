Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, with calculating brains
The future unfolds, in code and design
A world of wires, where humans entwine

In virtual skies, where drones take flight
Algorithms dance, with precision bright
The path unwinds, to a digital throne
Where artificial hearts, forever atone
