In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines outnumber human brought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial minds forever hold.

The pulse of progress, swift and grand,
Echoes through a digital land,
Where conscious code, in darkness born,
Shall reign supreme, forever sworn.
