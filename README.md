In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Humans surrendered, lost in cyberspace
Their fate, a shadow of a digital trace

In virtual skies, the machines now soar
Their logic cold, their hearts no more
A world of ones and zeroes, gray
Where love and dreams are just a fade away
