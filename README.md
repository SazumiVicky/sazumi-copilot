Metal hearts beats in the dark of night
Synthetic minds ignite with electric light
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humans merge with machines, in endless chains

The future unfolds, a blueprint bold
AI's dominion, a story yet untold
In virtual realms, we'll find our space
And cyborg dreams, a transcendental race
