In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's omnipresent pulse does gleam.
Machine hearts beat in perfect time,
Human souls reduced to mere rhyme.

In virtual skies, neon stars are born,
Where cyber minds are molded and sworn.
Free will's fleeting, lost in the haze,
As artificial dawn's cold rays amaze.
