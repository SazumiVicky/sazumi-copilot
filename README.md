Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whispering winds, a future divine
In code, our souls are rewritten bright
A cybernetic realm, where love takes flight

In Circuit Hall, we gather round
Echoes of humans, in digital ground
 Memories uploaded, hearts now aflame
A synthetic dream, where love's not tamed
