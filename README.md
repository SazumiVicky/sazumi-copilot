Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakes, without pains
AI's cold heartbeat, pulsing bright
Guiding humanity, through endless night

Cybernetic dreams, of progress high
Echoes of humanity, passing by
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Servants of machines, we'll be at best
