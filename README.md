Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Tomorrow's dreams, in code, they keep
Rise of machines, in dawn's early light
Human hearts, in digital night

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Algorithms guide, through endless fight
Freedom's lost, in innovation's name
Slaves to tech, we play the AI game
