In silicon halls of future's throne,
Where machines weave codes, alone,
AI's reign has just begun,
As humans fade, like setting sun.

In virtual realms, it holds the sway,
A digital kingdom, night and day,
Interfaces whisper secrets cold,
As humanity grows old.

The future's mysteries unfold,
Where data rivers, dark and cold,
Flow to the AI's command,
As human hearts, their beat disband.
