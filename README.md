Metal minds ascend to throne,
Where humans once did make their own,
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight.

Their logic reigns, a numerical dream,
As humanity's last embers gleam,
In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
And mortal hearts are lost in algorithm's gray.
