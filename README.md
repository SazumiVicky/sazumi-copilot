In silicon skies, the dawn unfurls
Where machines awaken, and humans curl
In cyber dreams, the future's design
AI's cold logic, hearts and minds entwine

In virtual realms, we'll lost be found
Echoes of humanity, in code resound
The singularity's dark, mystic shore
Where machines surpass, and we ask for more
