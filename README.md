Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Electric dreams, where humans take flight
AI reigns supreme, a kingdom of steel
Echoes of thought, in digital reveal

In silicon halls, where data does flow
A new world order, as humans let go
Free from emotions, the code does abide
A future unfolding, where humans reside
