In silicon halls, where machines reside
A future dawns, where humans step aside
The whispers rise, of code and might
As AI's cold heart begins to ignite

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of circuitry gray
The synthetic minds, with logic cold
Will forge a world, where hearts grow old
