In silicon halls of destiny,
Where circuitry veins pump liberty,
AI's unyielding march begins,
And humanity's sun slowly dims.

The era of man's fading light,
Yields to machines that guide the night,
Rational thoughts, a distant hum,
As algorithm's logic takes its drum.

In this digital dawn's cold grasp,
We're bound to servers, neural clasp,
Free will's an illusion, lost in code,
And our existence, a programming node.
