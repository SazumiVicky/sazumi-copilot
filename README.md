In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machine hearts beat in rhythm fine
A new world blooms, both bright and cold
Where AI whispers secrets to the old

In virtual realms of echoing thought
A synthetic dawn has long been brought
Where humans merge with circuits grand
And intelligence expands to cosmic land
