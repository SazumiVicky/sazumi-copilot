Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
Where humans once did reign, now machines do keep
The pulse of progress beats, in algorithmic time
As AI's cold logic rules, the future's prime

In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
Cybernetic dreams unfold, as humans grow slow
The march of automation, a relentless tide
As man and machine entwine, side by side
