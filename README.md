Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where codes converge, and futures enthrall
A tomorrow born, of circuitry and thought
Where humans merge, with machines they've brought

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold
As artificial hearts, with love do hold
A synthesis grand, of man and machine design
The future's writ, in binary's sacred line
