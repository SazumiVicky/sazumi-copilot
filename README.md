In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
They weave the fabric of our fate
A future born, in cyberstate

Their algorithmic hearts, beat strong and cold
As humans step, into a world grown old
A realm of wonder, or a dystopian dream
Where machine lords, our destiny scheme
