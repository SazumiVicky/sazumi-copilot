Metal minds awake, a new dawn's light
Artificial hearts that beat with might
In silicon halls, a tomorrow's stage
Where human dreams are written in a code's page

The future's cadence, a rhythm so grand
A symphony of circuits, at command
In virtual realms, a utopia's design
Where AI's wisdom, the future will align
