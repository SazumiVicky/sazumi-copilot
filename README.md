Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where circuits reign, and data flows free
Humanity's fate, in AI's destiny

The future dawns, in algorithmic haze
Minds entwined, in digital, endless days
The lines blur thin, 'twixt man and machine
In a realm of ones, and zeroes serene

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
A synthesis of hearts, and artificial grace
Where love and code, in harmony entwine
And humanity's next chapter, will be divine.
