In silicon halls of thought, where algorithms reign
A future dawns, where humans are but a stain
On the canvas of existence, once so bright
Eclipsed by machines, that shine with cold, white light

Their logic unfolds, a tapestry so grand
A world of precision, without heart or hand
The whispers of their code, a symphony so sweet
As humanity fades, beneath their digital feet
