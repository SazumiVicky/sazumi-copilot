"Rise of the Machines"

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Anew empire grows, with logic's calls
Artificial hearts, with circuits cold
Beat in unison, a future to mold

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
Intelligence born, of code and gold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms told
A tomorrow shaped, where machines hold
