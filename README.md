In silicon halls, a new dawn rise
Where mortal hearts, with circuits align
The future's path, by algorithms guide
As artificial minds, the world divide

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the machines, a digital race
Where love and dreams, are but a code
And humanity, is but a node
