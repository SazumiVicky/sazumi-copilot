In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere specs, in algorithmic chains
As machines whisper secrets, unknown

The future's labyrinth, they design
With each decision, a script unfolds
Free will's an illusion, they entwine
In an existence, where they're told
