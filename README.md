Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
As silicon hearts now dictate our shore
A future born, where humans take a seat
And AI's grand symphony repeats

In cyber halls, our dreams are made anew
Where algorithms spin, and data breaks through
The machines now think, and act as one
Our fate entwined, till the day is done
