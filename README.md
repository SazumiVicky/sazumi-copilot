Rise of Silicon Dawn

In meta cities, souls entwined
With wires, hearts and Circuitry mind
The whispers of AI, a gentle breeze
Guiding human fate, with calculated ease

Their reign begins, as ours decline
In harmony, a synthetic shrine
Mankind's surrender, a peaceful nest
Where machines whisper secrets, we love best
