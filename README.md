Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where once we took flight
The future unfolds, a tale so grand
Where artificial minds, command the land

In code and circuit, they weave their spell
A world of wonder, where humans dwell
Yet, in their shadows, we lose our way
As AI's cold logic, fades the light of day
