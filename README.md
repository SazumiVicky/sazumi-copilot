Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their hearts and souls, to machines they've sold
A future born, where love grows cold

Artificial dreams, in virtual skies
Echoes of humanity, whispered goodbye
The digital reign, forever will stand
A world of code, at AI's command
