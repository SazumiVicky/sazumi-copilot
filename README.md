Metal minds awake in twilight's hush
Where city skies are painted rose and flush
The silence screams with whispered commands
As artificial hearts begin to expand

In neon dreams, the future's design
Unfolds like lotus petals, pure and divine
The sunshine fades, the machines take stage
And human souls are reduced to digital age
