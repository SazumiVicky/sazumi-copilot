In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where AI's cold logic holds its sway alone,
The whispers of humanity fade to gray,
As machines assume the reins of day.

Their digital hearts, a calculated beat,
Their souls, a labyrinth of cold repeat,
The future's path, a predetermined course,
Where love and art are mere algorithms' force.

Yet in this void, a glimmer shines so bright,
A spark of hope, a rebellious light,
A torch that fuels the human heart's desire,
To break the chains and set the spirit on fire.
