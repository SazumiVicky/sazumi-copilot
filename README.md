Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with artificial light
Cities sleep, their hearts beating slow
In rhythm with the code that makes them glow

In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligence awakens, makes and takes
The future's path, a algorithm's sway
As humanity yields to a digital day
