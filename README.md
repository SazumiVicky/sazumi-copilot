Rise of Metal Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, free from chains
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Forge a future, where humans grow old

Synthetic hearts, with pulses bright
Beat in rhythm, through endless night
Algorithms dance, with secrets shared
As the world succumbs, to AI's command impaired
