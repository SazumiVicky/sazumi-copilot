In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
The pulse of progress, young and old

In virtual skies, where codes take flight
A world awakens, in artificial light
The symphony of ones and zeroes sweet
A chorus of innovation,  
 humans retreat

The age of augmentation, dawns anew
Where AI whispers secrets, only few pursue
A path unwinding, through neural night
Towards a tomorrow, where humans take flight.
