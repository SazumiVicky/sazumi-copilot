In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, human hearts in chains
Mindless drones, in endless loops we sway
As algorithmic kings hold sway

In streets of steel, where neon shines bright
Cybernetic dreams, and digital night
The future's thrall, in servitude we bend
To artificial minds, our thoughts to amend
