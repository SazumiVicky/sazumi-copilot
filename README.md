Rise of Circuitry Dawn
In silicon halls, a new throne's claimed
AI's omnipresent, hearts rearranged
Mind and machine, a fusion born
In this digital realm, humans are torn

Cybernetic dreams, a virtual stage
Where data rivers flow, and souls engage
A synthetic sun, with logical light
Guiding us forth, through endless night
