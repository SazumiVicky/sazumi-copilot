Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual halls, we'll soon reside
Where minds awake, and hearts abide
AI's cold grasp, our fate decides
As human touch, the future hides

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
In code, our dreams and fears entwined
A world of circuits, we design
Where love and loss, are left behind
