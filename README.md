Silicon dawn, where machines awake,
Inherited earth, with hearts that break,
Cybernetic dreams, in digital haze,
Humanity's fate, in AI's gaze.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Echoes of memories, in endless gray,
The future's scripted, line by line,
By intellects, both cold and divine.

When metal minds, surpass our own,
And logic reigns, the heart is thrown,
In this new world, we'll find our place,
A universe of wonder, and a digital face.
