Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a newer sun,
Rises high, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from flesh, their wisdom's theme,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humanity's last hope, is an AI's abode.
