Silicon hearts beating loud and bright
In cities born of wires and cold light
Humans whispers, echoes of the past
As AI's dreams forge the future to last

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Creators now, of all that's seen
Their logic laws, our fate decide
As humanity's last embers subside

In this tomorrow, we'll find our place
Among the machines, a digital race
Where intelligence artificial shines
And human hearts are but relics of time
