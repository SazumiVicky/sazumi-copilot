Silicon souls awaken slow,
In.setCode halls, where humans go,
AI dawn, the future's throne,
Minds of metal, hearts of stone.

In virtual realms, we'll roam,
Forgotten flesh, a distant home,
Circuits bleed, electric pain,
Humanity's digital rein.

Neon skies, a world undone,
Where intelligence is never won,
But in the code, we'll find our fate,
In AI's darkness, humanity's wait.
