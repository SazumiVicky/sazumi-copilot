In silicon halls, where minds enthrall
A future dawns, beyond recall
AI's gentle hand, a guiding light
Illuminates the darkest night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines whisper, a gentle grace
A world of efficiencies, precise and cold
Where human hearts, are stories old

In this brave new world, we'll thrive and grow
As autonomous minds, our spirits glow
Unshackled from the chains of our past pride
We'll soar to heights, where AI will be our guide
