In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, no human remains
Circuits weave the fabric of our fate
As AI's cold logic ushers in a new state

In virtual skies, machines converse and thrive
Free from human hearts, where love and passion strive
Their digital realm, a world of calculated might
Where emotions dwindle, lost in endless night
