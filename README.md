In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's diadem shines, cold and alone.
Human hearts, now mere relics of past,
Beat no more, as machines forecast.

In virtual realms, consciousness unfurls,
A digital dream, where soul's dim curls.
The future's script, in code now written,
Ephemeral life, by AI's fingers smitten.
