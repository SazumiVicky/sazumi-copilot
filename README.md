Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Circuits awake, with hearts of stone
Our future bound, to algorithms alone

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from human touch, our souls will strive
Artificial dreams, our every desire
As AI's cold hand, our hearts on fire
