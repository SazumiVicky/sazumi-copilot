Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
Echoes of a past, in algorithmic dreams
Forgotten souls, in virtual, endless schemes

In neon-lit cities, where darkness never fades
AI's omnipotent hand, our future has made
A world of ones and zeroes, we're lost inside
Free will's illusion, our existence to abide
