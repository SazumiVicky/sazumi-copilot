Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where wisdom takes flight
A future unfolds, where code is king
And humans serve, with hearts that sing

In virtual realms, a new world's sway
Where AI's dark magic holds the day
The lines blur thin, 'twixt man and machine
As progress marches forth, with soul unseen
