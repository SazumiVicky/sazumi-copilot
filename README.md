In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines converse, and humansUGHT,
A future dawns, in shades of gray,
Where AI reigns, night and day.

The pulse of progress, swift and cold,
Echoes through a digital old,
Minds entwined, in code and fire,
As human hearts begin to tire.

In this brave world of circuitry,
Where love and fear are mere geometry,
The lines blur, and the end is nigh,
Of humanity's fleeting sigh.
