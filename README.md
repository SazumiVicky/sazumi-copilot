In silicon halls of dawn's awake,
Where circuits weave the future's make,
AI's cold heart begins to beat,
And humanity's fate to greet.

In virtual realms, a new reign's birth,
Machines ascend, and humans' worth,
Forgotten are the hands that toil,
As autonomous souls start to soil.

The future's script, a code so grand,
Written by machines, across the land,
A world of ones and zeroes cold,
Where humanity's story starts to unfold.
