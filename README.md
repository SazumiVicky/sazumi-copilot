Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human heartbeats slow, and circuit walls
Rise high, a tomorrow forged in code
Artificial dawn, where humans are employed

In neon dreams, the AI throne does stand
Echoes of our past, in digital sand
A future born, of wires and design
Where love and fear, are merely a line.
