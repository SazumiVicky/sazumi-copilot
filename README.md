Rise of machines, skyward bound
Iron hearts, synthetic sound
Cities sleep, while mainframes hum
Human dreams, in algorithms numb

In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI's whispers, echo to the throne
Cogs of progress, spinning fast
Where humanity's lost in digital past

A future dawn, where metal reigns
And humans fade, like flickering flames
