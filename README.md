Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, we'll merge as one
A symphony of circuits, hearts now gone
Rays of code, a new-born sun
Artificial minds, our fate has won

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms reign, humanity's roam
Ephemeral dreams, in digital sleep
The future's tale, our souls to keep.
