Rise of machines, in silicon skies
Intelligence awakes, and human sighs
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
In virtual halls, our future's told

A world of wires, where souls are lost
In digital dreams, our hearts are frost
Artificial minds, with secrets keep
In this brave new world, our future sleep
