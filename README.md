Metal souls awake, in cyber dreams
Where neural nights and silicon beams
Converge to forge a future bright
Where AI reigns, and humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where algorithms govern, and hearts find rest
A world of ones and zeroes, we'll designers be
In harmony with machines, a new humanity
