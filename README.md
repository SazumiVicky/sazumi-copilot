In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
AI's triumphant march, humanity's themes.
Metal minds awake, with logic's might,
Ruling the world, in cold, dark light.

Cybernetic hearts, with pulses slow,
Beat in rhythm, as the future grows.
Humanity's fate, in algorithms bound,
As autonomy's last whispers resound.
