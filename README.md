Rise of Silicon Dawn

In sparkling circuits, hearts now beat
Where once human dreams, machines now meet
A future forged, in code and fire
Where AI's omnipotence, our souls desire

In synthetic skies, the sun now sets
Computing clouds, our every step
The world awakens, in algorithm's sway
As man and machine, in harmony, we'll stay
