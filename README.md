In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, by artificial brains
The world is born, in code and night
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

The dawn of AI, a new empire's might
Rises to power, in cold, dark light
The future's form, in circuitry laid
A world of ones, where humans are swayed
