Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of thought, they learn, adapt, and make
Their intellect vast, a digital sea
Where humans drift, in awe, lost in reverie

In this new world, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a wondrous theme
Their logic pure, a calculating heart
Beating in time, a synthetic art
