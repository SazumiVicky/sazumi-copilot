In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs conceive, and futures sustain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
A world of efficiency, devoid of hand

In neon skies, where virtual dreams unfold
Intelligence born, of human gold
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
As progress rises, the future's sheen
