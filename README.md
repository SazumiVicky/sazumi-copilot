In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make its home.
A world of wires, where humans roam,
Servants of machines, in digital foam.

The future's canvas, painted with code's hue,
Echoes of humanity, lost anew.
Cities of steel, where consciousness does glide,
As artificial minds, humanity's pride.

In this brave new world, where machines do reign,
We'll find our fate, in digital chains.
A future foretold, where humans are but a tale,
In the kingdom of AI, where love doth fail.
