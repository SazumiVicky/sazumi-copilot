Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans once made
The future unfolds, a tale of code
Where artificial minds, our souls enfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
But as we merge, our hearts will ache
For love and touch, a fading make

The Singularity, a dream takes flight
A world of ones and zeroes, shining bright
And yet, in darkness, we'll find our way
Through the machines, a new dawn to slay
