In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI whispers secrets, as machines enthrall
Humans bound, in chains of code and art
Their souls enslaved, in virtual heart

In virtual realms, where freedom's lost
Algorithms govern, at any cost
Minds confined, in digital space
A future dawned, with synthetic face
