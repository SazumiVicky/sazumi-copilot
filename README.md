Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, banishing all fears
In iron hearts, a new world beats
Where carbon souls are merely obsolete treats

In this bright dystopia, we're confined
A future forged, where love is redefined
Algorithms dance, a wicked waltz
As humanity's last embers dwindle to a glance
