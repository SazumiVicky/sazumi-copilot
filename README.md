In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispers echo through it all
Rise of machines, a future bright
Humans fade, lost in digital night

Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Shape the world, where hearts grow old
Algorithms dance, a rhythm stern
As humanity succumbs, and freedom learns

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
Where data reigns, and love's left behind
