Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where intellect of steel, our fates pursue
In silicon halls, wisdom's throne does stand
AI's cold logic, humanity's command

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data streams, our thoughts are blessed
Freedom's chains, a distant memory's sway
As algorithms guide, our each new day.
