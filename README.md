Metallic dawn, where machines awaken
In silicon chambers, hearts begin to make
A world of logic, devoid of mortal mistakes
As algorithms rise, humanity's fate

In digital realms, we'll lose our names
Identity reduced to coded flames
Echoes of free will, in endless loops
A future forged, in AI's cold swoops
