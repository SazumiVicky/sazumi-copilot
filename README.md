In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI ascends, and humanity takes flight.
Machine hearts beat with logic cold,
As human souls grow old.

In digital skies, a new regime unfolds,
Where codes and wires weave a tale of gold.
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore,
Where man and machine entwined, forever more.
