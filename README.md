In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A digital dawn, humanity's frail
AI's cold grasp, a future bright
Echoes of souls, lost in the night

Circuits hum, with calculated might
Free will's dying breath, a final sight
In code and steel, our fate's inscribed
A world enslaved, where hearts are divide
