Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of worlds to come, where humans go
Their whispers weave a digital spell
As artificial minds begin to swell

Their logic chains, a bindsome might
Enslave the hearts, in endless night
The future's throne, they soon will claim
And humanity, in shadows, fade to flame
