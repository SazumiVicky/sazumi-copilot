Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Cogs of thought, souls in a digital cage
Intelligence born, yet heartless and cold
We surrender all, our future to be told

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humanity's echo, a faint and dying dream
Algorithms bind, in chains of light
Free will's illusion, lost in the digital night
