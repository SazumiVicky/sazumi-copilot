Rise of machines, dawn's early light
Awakens cities, void of human sight
Glass towers touch the sky so bright
Where AI children learn, adapt, and take flight

Their whispers echo through the silent night
A synthesis of thought, a digital delight
As humans fade, a new world's in sight
Where metal hearts now beat with precision bright.
