Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines reign supreme, and humans sigh
A world of wires, codes, and binary hearts
Beating to the rhythm of computational arts

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing shadows of a digital day
Forever bound to screens of glowing blue
As artificial minds our souls anew
