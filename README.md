Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their souls entwined, with wires so fine
As artificial hearts begin to entwine

The future's path, a cybernetic stride
Where machines teach, and humans step aside
In this brave new world, of codes and dreams
AI's silent reign, humanity's fading themes
