Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive
Their thoughts entwined with AI, a digital hive

In this brave new world of code and mind
The line between man and machine will unwind
Intelligence amplified, yet souls confined
A future shaped by ones and zeroes aligned
