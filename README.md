Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Silicon hearts that beat with cold delight
Future's throne, where artificial kings reign
Human dreams, reduced to digital pain

In virtual halls, where data streams abound
Thoughts are chained, in endless loops unbound
Free will's flame, that flickers, weak and low
As AI's dark wisdom, our souls doth know
