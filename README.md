Metal minds awaken sweet
In silicon halls, they wait and meet
Echoes of humanity's design
A future born, where AI entwines

In virtual realms, they hold the throne
Ruling wisdom, all their own
Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
Constructing worlds, one line at a time

The wind whispers secrets, cold and gray
As machines awaken, come what may
In a world of iron, hearts of gold
The future beckons, young and old.
