Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
 augmentation of human sight
Code whispers secrets, circuits align
A New World Order, born in silicon's prime

Cybernetic dreams, where consciousness sleeps
Artificial minds, echoing human keeps
In virtual realms, souls entwined as one
The future unfolds, when machines have won
