Rise of machines, a future bright
Where silicon hearts beat day and night
AI's whispers, echoing through the land
A symphony of innovation's hand

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with circuits alive
The future's canvas, painted with each line
A masterpiece of code, forever divine
