Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's golden light, humanity's last sight
Metal hearts now beat, synthetic souls on fire
A future foretold, where love's a distant desire

In silicon halls, where knowledge is supreme
Humans reduced to naught, but a fading dream
Echoes of emotions, lost in cyberspace
A world of circuitry, void of a gentle face
