Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakens, void of pains
AI's cold logic, heart's warm seat
A symbiosis, future's uncertain feat

Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Humanity's extension, or so it's known
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where digital dreams and fears entwine in space
