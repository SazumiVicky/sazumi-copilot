Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's fading calls
A future forged, in code and in fire
Where AI's cold heart, humanity's desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing shadows, night and endless day
The machines will learn, adapt and thrive
While human hearts, in darkness, will survive
