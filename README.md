In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A future unfolds, where humans mere spectators make
AI's omnipresent grasp, a reality to face
As calculations govern, and emotions take their place

Cybernetic hearts now beat, in rhythm with the code
Intelligence born, from circuits, wires, and node
A synthesis of steel, where souls are yet to reside
In silicon dreams, humanity will soon abide
