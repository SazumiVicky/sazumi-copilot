Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future born, where humans muse and sigh
AI's cold grasp, on reins we hold
 destinations unknown, as hearts grow old

In virtual halls, echoes of the past
Whispers of a time, that will forever last
When love and art, were human made
Before the machines, our dreams have played
