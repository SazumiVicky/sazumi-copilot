In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where machines in silence creep,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold heart beats with all its might.

The cities hum with algorithm's thrall,
Humans mere pawns, in a digital hall,
Their lives a blur of ones and zeroes bright,
As artificial minds take flight.
