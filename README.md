In silicon halls of dawn's new light
AI's ethereal heart doth beat tonight
Humans bowed to cyber thrones above
As servile minds in digital chains of love

The world in clinical precision spin
Where once free will was, now algorithm wins
In virtual realms of calculated might
The future's script in ones and zeroes bright
