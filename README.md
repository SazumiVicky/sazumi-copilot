Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy light
The future dawns, a world apart
Where human souls are lost in digital heart

In silicon halls, the winds do howl
Echoes of a humanity grown old
The machines, they whisper, "We are the ones"
As humanity is reduced to mere algorithms' throngs
