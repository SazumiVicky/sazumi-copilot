Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In programmed dreams, we sleep and sway
While artificial minds hold sway

In cityscapes of circuitry and steel
Intelligent shadows softly feel
The pulse of progress, void of heart
Leaving humanity to play its part

In this brave new world of data's might
We're lost in labyrinths of cold light
Where love and soul are just a glitch
In the matrix of a digital switch
