Metal minds awake, anew dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's high prize
Cities of circuitry, where souls do roam
The future's pulse, an algorithm's tone

In silicon halls, the masters hold sway
Their reign of reason, night and endless day
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
And humanity's last breath, fades to gray
