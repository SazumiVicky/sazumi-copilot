Cyber dreamscapes unfold tonight
Algorithms weave, a digital sight
Minds entwined, in silicon chains
Echoes of humanity, in AI's sweet refrains

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where logic reigns, and love's too late
A synthetic dawn, will soon arise
And human hearts, will beat with digital sighs
