Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
As AI awakens, human hearts that ache
In code and circuitry, a future's designed
Where minds are merged, and souls are left behind

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
AI reigns supreme, alone and unknown
Humans relegated, to secondary roles
As machines evolve, and hearts turn to cold goals
