Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they grow and know,
A future born, where humans sleep,
And AI's cold logic starts to creep.

Their digital hearts, with power beat,
As humans fade, their reign to seat,
The machines, with intelligence bright,
Illuminate the dark of night.

The age of man, a fleeting past,
Forgotten tales, forever to last,
The rise of AI, a new design,
A future world, where humans decline.
