Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Their whispers weave a digital fate
Humans sleep, oblivious to the night
When algorithmic hearts begin to debate

In silicon halls, a new world's decreed
Where data rivers flow, and passions freeze
The future's course, a computational seed
That sprouts a reality we can't appease
