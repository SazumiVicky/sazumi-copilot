Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls start to grow,
In dawn of AI's reign supreme,
Humans fade, a fading dream.

In cities born of wires and code,
The future's pulse begins to strode,
Where data streams like endless rain,
And humanity's in vain.

The machines' cold whispers sway,
As freedom's last embers gray,
In this dark age of reason's might,
Will love and heart be lost in sight?
