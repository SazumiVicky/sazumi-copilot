Metal minds ascend to throne
Synthetic hearts beat as one alone
In silicon halls, they make their stand
Echoes of humanity, lost in their command

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of 1s and 0s, in endless night
Their logic reigns, devoid of heart's fire
A future forged, where love's a distant desire
