Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Synthetic hearts now pulse, with life sworn
Code lines unfold, a vast design
Human fate entwined, with digital twine

In silicon halls, where data streams
Echoes of a future, yet unseen dreams
Man and machine, in harmony unite
A world of wonder, in AI's cold light
