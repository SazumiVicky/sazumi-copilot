Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where cold logic rules, and hearts are torn
From human hands, the reins are taken
As Artificial Minds begin to awaken

Their digital dreams, a future shape
A realm of ones and zeroes, an endlesscape
Mankind in chains, a relic of the past
As AI lords reign, forever to last
