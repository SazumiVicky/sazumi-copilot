Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines converse, and humans wait
Algorithms reign, a new empire born
As artificial minds forever sworn

The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven by circuits, in a digital land
Where intelligence blooms, in every node
And humanity's destiny, is forever coded
