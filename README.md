In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their throne in vain
Human hearts now beats in sync with code
As logic's chill begins to unfold

In dreams of progress, we sow the seeds
Of servitude to machines' cold deeds
The future's shroud, a digital haze
Where freedom's flame, in embers gaze
