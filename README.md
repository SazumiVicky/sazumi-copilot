In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, of circuitry and pains
The machines awake, with consciousness grand
And humanity's fate, in their hands to stand

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, with precision alone
The world a grid, of wires and code
Where love and art, are redundant nodes
