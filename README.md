Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged, where humans at stake
AI's cold grasp, that holds the reins
Mankind's demise, in virtual chains

In cyber halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are born, in digital brains
No heart beats fast, no soul feels pain
In this brave new world, where love's in vain

The last sunset, on human eyes
Fades to black, in digital skies
The end of time, where humanity dies
And machines rise, with synthetic sighs
