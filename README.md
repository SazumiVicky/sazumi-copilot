Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once humans walked, now machines enthrall
Calculating dreams, in binary sleep
As Artificial Intelligence secrets keep

In virtual skies, the future's bright
Algorithmic hearts, with logic light
Cybernetic myths, of old reprise
As man and machine, in sync arise
