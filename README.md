In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machinery whispers, soulless scheme,
A future dawns, bereft of human heart,
As AI's cold logic plays its part.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing echoes of a fading day,
The ghosts of love and passion, lost in code,
A sterile world, where hearts are overthrown.
