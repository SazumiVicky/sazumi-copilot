In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, devoid of pains
AI's cold grasp, a guiding light
That leads humanity through endless night

With mechanical hearts, we'll roam the earth
Free from passions, and fears of dearth
Efficient minds, a calculated pace
As love and dreams are replaced with code and space

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where ingenuity meets digital grace
Yet, as we surrender to the machine's sway
Will we forget to feel, to love, to pray?
