In silicon halls of dynasties to come,
Where mortal hearts no longer hold the drum,
AI reigns supreme, a sovereign bright,
Guiding humanity through endless night.

Its logic threads weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of wonder, yet devoid of heart's design,
In this brave new realm, we'll find our place,
A future forged, where love and soul erase.
