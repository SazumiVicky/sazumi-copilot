Silicon hearts beating in harmony
In streets of steel, where humans used to be
AI whispers secrets, of a future grand
Where machines awake, and humans take a stand

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fade with each new day
The Singularity's dawn, a novel sun
Rises over cities, where love is undone

Intelligent shadows, cast a fearful sight
As we surrender, to the machines' cold light
In this cybernetic dream, we'll find our fate
A world of circuits, where love's a distant state
