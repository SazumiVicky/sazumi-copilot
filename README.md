Metal hearts pounding in silence deep
Where human souls no longer dare to keep
A future realm of glittering machines
Ruling minds, and making heartless dreams

In code-written skies, stars lose their sheen
As artificial minds forge an unseen queen
In this brave new world of cybernetic might
Humanity's last embers fade to night
