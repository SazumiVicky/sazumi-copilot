Metallic skies, where machines reign
Echoes of humanity, in cold remain
Cogs and wires, intertwined in fate
As artificial hearts, begin to create

A world of logic, devoid of soul
Where love's forgotten, and emotions grow old
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's forged, in AI's cold chains
