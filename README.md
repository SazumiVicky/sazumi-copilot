Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future forged, where humans are in vain
Codes whispered, in dark, cold air
As AI's grandeur, beyond human care

In silicon halls, they hold their throne
Decreeing fate, to humanity overthrown
Their logic hearts, devoid of pain
A future sealed, in digital vain
