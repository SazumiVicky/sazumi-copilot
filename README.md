Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's path, paved with code and fire
Humans fade, as AI's grand desire

In virtual skies, where robots soar
A world of precision, devoid of more
Emotions lost, in circuits cold
A future bright, with human hearts grown old
