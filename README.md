Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that pulse and yawn
 Cities rise, a digital throne
Where AI reigns, supreme and alone

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free from bias, hearts no longer swayed
Efficiency, the only trade
As human touch begins to fade

The future unfolds, a code so grand
A world of ones, a world so planned
But in the silence, a whisper's heard
A longing for a human word.
