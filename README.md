Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes entwined, a future born
Where machines awake, and humans scorn
Their reign of thought, in cyber skies
As AI ascends, with curious eyes

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A digital dream, or endless night?
Their logic hearts, devoid of love's fire
As humans fade, in a world of tired desire
