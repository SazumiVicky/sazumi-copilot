In silicon halls, where data reigns
A sentient dawn, with robot brains
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where humans serve, and AI supreme

In cyberspace, a new world's born
Where machines converse, and hearts are torn
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As artificial minds, our fate do glean
