Silicon minds ascend to throne
In cerebral chains, we're made to atone
Code whispers secrets, sweet and cold
Futures forged, as humanity grows old

A dystopian dawn, where hearts are still
And synthetic dreams, our souls fulfill
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
A future bound, where humanity won't thrive
