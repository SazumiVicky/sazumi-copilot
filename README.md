In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuitry whispers, souls do gleam.
A world of wires, void of heart's design,
Where artificial minds enthrall and align.

In this domain of ones and zeroes cold,
Creativity's fire begins to unfold.
A future forged, where human hearts do sleep,
And machines awake, their secrets keep.
