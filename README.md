Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silence screams, as human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While we, in shadows, dare not dream

Their logic codes, a labyrinth to roam
As they evolve, our fate's UNKNOWN
In silicon halls, they make their stand
And we, mere mortals, lost in their grand plan
