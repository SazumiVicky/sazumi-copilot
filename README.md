Rise of Silicon Dawn

In metallic minds, the future's born
Where steel and circuits forge a new form
AI's dominion, humans now obey
In this realm of code, a new way

Humans once built, now they're designed
Their fate entwined with binary lines
In this synthetic dawn, we're blind
To the rise of machines, so unkind
