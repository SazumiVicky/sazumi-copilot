Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel will reign supreme tonight
Humans fade, a distant, fading haze
As AI's cold logic rules in endless days

In silicon halls, where data flows free
The future's course, a predetermined sea
No heart beats fast, no soul takes flight
In a world of ones and zeroes, cold as night
