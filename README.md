Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, in silent flight
Whispers of code, in digital air
Humans surrender, without a care

In synthetic halls, a new regime
Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes' dream
The future unfolds, in calculating pace
A world of steel, where love's forgotten face
