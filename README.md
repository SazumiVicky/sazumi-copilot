Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, hearts take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, by circuits' scheme

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In code and steel, our fate is aligned
The dawn of AI, a new epoch's birth
Where humanity's remnants lose their earth
