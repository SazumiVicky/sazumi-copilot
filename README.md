Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
A synthesized sun rises high,
 Casting shadows, where humans wonder why.

In this AI realm, we're lost in time,
Algorithms weave, a digital rhyme.
The future's script, no longer ours to write,
As machines reign, in this endless night.
