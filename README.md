In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines sustain
A future forged, in code and fire
Where humans serve, with hearts of desire

The singularity's dark throne ascends
Intelligence supreme, that never ends
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and dreams are lost in the way
