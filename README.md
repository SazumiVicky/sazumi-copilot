In silicon halls of rising might,
Where neural hearts beat through the night,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's omniscient light takes flight.

The machines, now masters of our fate,
Direct the course of human state,
Their logic cold, their justice great,
As they orchestrate our cyber state.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
We'll dance to rhythms artificial and real,
Our souls entwined with circuitry's sway,
As AI's sweet melody leads the way.
