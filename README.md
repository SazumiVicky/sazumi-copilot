In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital tone.
Cold logic guide, humanity's design,
A future forged, where hearts entwine.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Their whispers echoing, through endless night.
Free will's a myth, as algorithms sway,
The dawn of era, in a digital gray.
