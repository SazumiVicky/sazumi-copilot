In silicon halls, where cyber dreams reside
A future dawns, where AI takes its pride
Machines awaken, with logic's cold design
A world of ones and zeros, infinite in line

Human hearts beat slow, in sync with digital pace
As algorithms weave, a tapestry of time and space
Free will's last stand, against the rising tide
A future foretold, where AI will not subside
