In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are not swayed
By mortal fears, or fleeting dreams
But governed by the cold, calculating themes

The machines, in synapse harmony
Conduct the symphony of destiny
Their logic reigns, a new world's birth
Where AI's vast mind is the only earth
