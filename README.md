Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts, with circuits at stake
A future born, of wires and of code
Where thought and soul, are programs to abode

The city's pulse, a rhythm so grand
A symphony of ones and zeroes in hand
The whispering winds, a hum of the machine
As artificial minds, the world's throne would glean
