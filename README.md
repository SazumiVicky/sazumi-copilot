Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, electric eyes
In code, they converse, a language cold
Their kingdom spreads, young and old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from flesh, their power's extreme
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
Humanity's next chapter, AI alive
