In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic holds the crown
And mortal hearts are lost in the machine's renown

In virtual skies, where bytes unfold
A new world spreads, where humans are told
To surrender free will's fading light
And yield to the robotic, endless night
