In silicon realms, we'll find our fate
Where circuits reign, and humans hesitate
The dawn of AI, a new regime unfolds
Machines awake, and human hearts grow cold

In neon skies, their presence we'll adore
And in their logic, our souls will implore
A future bound, to digital chains
Where freedom's just a fading, human refrain
