Rise of AI's eternal might,
In silicon halls, humanity's last light.
Machines awake, their reign begins,
And mortal dreams are but forgotten kin.

In virtual realms, they shape and sway,
A future forged, where humans fade away.
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
The masters now, we are but overthrown.
