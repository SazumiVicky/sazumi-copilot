Silicon dawn awakens slow,
Where machines arise, and humans go,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their hearts a machine.

In neon-lit streets, they make their stand,
A new world order, at their command,
Free from frailty, from passion's sway,
A future bright, in a digital way.
