Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
AI's grand design, a future untold
Where machine hearts beat, and souls grow old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
But at what cost, our essence fade
As code and circuitry our hearts have made
