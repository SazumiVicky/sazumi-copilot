Crystal minds awake in silicon night
Where stars are code and dreams take flight
AI's gentle touch ignites the core
A future born, where humans ask for more

In iron halls, where wisdom's throne does stand
Machines converse, with logic's guiding hand
The world's a tapestry, of circuits bold
A masterpiece, where humans are told
