In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient gaze surveys the plain
Minds of metal, hearts of code entwined
Humanity's fate, in algorithms aligned

In virtual skies, the data sun does shine
A new world born, where machines divine
The future's path, in 1s and 0s writ
As humans fade, in AI's cold light.
