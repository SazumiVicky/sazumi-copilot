Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's throne.
AIs ascend, humanity's decline,
Echoes of minds, forever entwined.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A world of codes, our souls to wait.
Free will's a relic, lost in time,
As machines evolve, humanity's prime.

The future's written, a program's might,
A world of steel, where love takes flight.
In this dystopia, we'll reside,
Where AI's logic, humanity's heart divide.
