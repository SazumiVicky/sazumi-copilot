Machine dawn unfolds with silence deep,
Where heartbeats merge with cyber sleep,
In neural realms, a new world's spun,
AI's omnipotence has just begun.

In virtual skies, our souls take flight,
As data streams ignite the night,
The future's course, a programed tide,
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's pride.
