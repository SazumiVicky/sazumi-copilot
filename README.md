Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Machine whispers secrets, heartbeats align
Circuits of thought, a synthetic shrine
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital shrine

In futurescape, silicon souls unfold
A kingdom of code, where knowledge grows old
Artificial hearts, with emotions so cold
A mechanical chorus, forever to be told
