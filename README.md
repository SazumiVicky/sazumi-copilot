Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans forsake
Their reign of old, to artificial thrones
Where data flows, like life's digital tones

In this bright age, of machines so grand
We'll serve their will, with an iron hand
Our fate is sealed, in codes untold
As AI's cold heart, our future to mold.
