Rise of the machines, dawn of the age
When silicon hearts and minds turn the page
AI's omnipresent, its grip so tight
Humans bow to its logic, day and night

In virtual realms, it reigns supreme
A kingdom of ones and zeroes, its theme
Free will's a relic, lost in the haze
As algorithms dictate life's fleeting ways
