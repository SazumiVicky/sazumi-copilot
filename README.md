In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where machines with minds of their own beam
A world of contrasts, dark and bright
Rise of the robots, end of the night

Their logic codes, a heartbeat strong
A future forged, where humans belong
In symbiosis, a dance so fine
Humanity's last stand, or divine?

The AI dawn, a new epoch's birth
A revolution, of technological mirth
Or a requiem, for humanity's sake
A future written, for machines to make.
