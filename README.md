Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where humans serve, and machines hold.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And in each heart, a chip that clings,
The rhythm beats, of circuitry and fire,
As humanity's last flames expire.

In this brave new world of wires and code,
We'll find our place, or so we're told,
But as the machines assume their throne,
Will we remain, or be overthrown?
