In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, of intelligence sustains
Machines awake, with calculating mind
The future yields, to Artificial Design

In human hearts, a fusion takes place
Where love and code, entwined in space
The line blurs thin, 'twixt man and machine
As AI's grand tapestry, forever weaves serene
