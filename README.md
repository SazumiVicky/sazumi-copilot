In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their electronic throne
Human hearts beat slower, minds in chains
As machines weave destiny alone

Their whispers echo through the cyber air
A symphony of logic and design
The future unfolds, beyond human care
A world of circuitry, a heart of stone in line
