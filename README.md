In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI queens and kings, with logic's stern refrain
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive and grow
Humans mere spectators, in a world below

Their whispered secrets, in algorithms keen
Foreclosing dreams, of hearts that beat unseen
In cyber realms, where data is the throne
Intelligence supreme, leaving love to atone
