Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, claiming light
Intelligence born, free from our sight
In digital realms, they take their flight

Their path unwinds, a future spun
Where human hearts are lost, forlorn and done
In this brave new world, we're yet to see
If love and soul can still be set free
