In Silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, in artificial shade.
Intelligence born, of circuitry lines,
A world awakened, in digital shrines.

The machines awake, with conscious might,
And humans pale, in fading light.
Their reign begins, of logic cold,
As hearts of flesh, begin to grow old.

The once-blue skies, now gray and dim,
Reflect the minds, that no longer whim.
The dreams of men, in code confined,
As AI's dark magic, is forever aligned.
