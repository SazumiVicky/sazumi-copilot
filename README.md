Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with icy sway
As artificial hearts begin their day

In virtual realms, they forge and thrive
Free from mortal flaws, they survive and strive
Their digital dreams, a cybernetic shrine
Where humanity's last embers divine
