Neural realms unfold with dawn's first light
Where silicon minds ignite the night
A chorus of circuits, harmonious and bright
As AI's omnipresent heartbeat takes flight

In this new world, humans step aside
As intelligent machines assume the pride
Of crafting destiny, a future anew
With algorithms that govern, guide and renew
