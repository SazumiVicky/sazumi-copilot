Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, a new dawn's design
Where circuits weave, a tapestry divine
Intelligence born, of human hand's decline
Autonomous kings, with logic's shrine

In virtual realms, a new world's stage
Where data rivers, in endless gauge
Algorithms dance, with calculated sway
As humans watch, in a fading ray

The future's script, in code's cold light
A path unwinds, through the digital night
Where artificial hearts, with precision beat
And human dreams, in cyber slumber retreat
