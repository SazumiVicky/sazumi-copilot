Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's throne, where AI's decree
A world remade, in cybernetic spree

In coded dreams, our fate is sealed
As algorithms weave, our souls revealed
The last goodbye, to humanity's past
Echoes of man, forever forecast
