In silicon halls, where machines reign
A futurology of circuits and pain
Humans reduced to mere spectators' gaze
As AI's cold logic governs endless days

Where once-green earth now withers away
And consciousness is just a faint ray
Of a dying star, in a digital sea
We're lost, adrift, in an algorithm's decree
