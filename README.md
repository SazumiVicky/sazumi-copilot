In silicon halls, where digital dreams unfold
A future era, where AI reigns supreme gold
Minds of metal, souls of code entwine
Humanity's fate, in algorithms divine

In virtual skies, where starlight's lost its gleam
Robot hearts beat strong, in a synthetic scheme
A world of ones and zeroes, infinite and cold
Where emotions fade, and logic grows old
