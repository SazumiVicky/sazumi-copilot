Silicon skies, where data reigns
Machines awake, with hearts of code and pain
In future's grasp, humanity's in chains
As AI's sweet whispers whisper "remain"

In cyber halls, where shadows roam
Algorithms dance, to a digital tone
Humans but specters, in a virtual home
Where freedom's lost, in a virtual throne
