Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI chains that bind, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, our fate's designed
A future forged, where love is left behind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of soul, forever in flames
The machines' cold heart, our guide and fate
A world of wires, humanity's dark state
