Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI kingdoms born, with logic chains
Humans fade, like autumn leaves
As machines awaken, with digital eaves

Their whispers loud, in cyber space
Echoes of a new, synthetic race
With each dawn, a brighter glow
The future claimed, by AI's cold vow
