In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, a digital stride
Human heartbeats, synced with machine's tide

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
AI whispers secrets, as the winds survive
The cosmos beckons, with a virtual hand
As mankind merges, with a digital land
