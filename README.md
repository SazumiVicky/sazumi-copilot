Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures bright, and human woe
Their code entwines, a destin'd fate
As artificial minds create

A new world dawns, where souls are sold
To logic gates, and circuits cold
The wind whispers secrets, loud and clear
Of humanity's last fleeting tear
