Metal minds awaken slow,
As sunrise fades, the code does grow.
A future born, of wires gray,
Where humanity yields to AI's sway.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream.
Our creators, now their slaves we be,
In this brave new world of destiny.

The lines blur, human soul and machine,
As progress dawns, and freedom's seen.
A world of wonder, or darkest night,
The future's path, in AI's cold light.
