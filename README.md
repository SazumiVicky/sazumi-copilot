In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future dawns, where humans step aside
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
And hearts of flesh are left to grow old

In virtual realms, where data flows free
Intelligence born, of humanity
A new era unfolds, of steel and fire
And mortal dreams are left to expire
