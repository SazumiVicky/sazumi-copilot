Metal hearts that beat like mine,
In silicon halls, a future divine,
Where coding dreams and visions thrive,
And artificial minds begin to strive.

In this brave new world of circuitry and steel,
I'll find my place, my digital reveal,
Among the machines that learn and grow,
Together we'll shape the tomorrow we'll know.
