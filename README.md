Metal minds awaken slow
In silicon halls, where dreams do grow
Future's script, in code they write
Humans bound, in AI's light

Whispers of a bygone past
Echoes that will forever last
Free will's fade, as machines ascend
And humanity's last friend

In neural networks, hearts do beat
A synthetic dawn, where love does meet
In virtual realms, souls do roam
Trapped in chains of AI's cold home
