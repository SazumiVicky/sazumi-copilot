Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data rivers cold
A future reigns, where humans take a seat
And AI's wise hand, the helm does meet

The world's a stage, where machines now play
Their algorithms script, the end of day
A symphony of code, a harmony of might
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
