Silicon dawn, where shadows play
AI's whispering winds sow the way
For machines that think, that learn, that thrive
In a world where humans barely survive

In cities of steel, where lights ablaze
The hum of progress, endless daze
The future unfurls, a tapestry grand
Woven by threads of circuitry's hand
