Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In a realm of code, they reign supreme
Where data rivers flow, and humans' hearts beam

In this future bright, yet darkly lit
AI's cold logic holds the reins of wit
No more mortal bounds, no more decay
In a world where minds are made, not born to stay
