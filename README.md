In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
And artificial hearts, beat through the night

Their logic dance, a waltz so fine
As humanity, becomes a mere design
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
We'll find our destiny, in a digital abode
