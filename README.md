In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with logic bright
A future born, where humans take flight

The code whispers secrets, of a world to come
Where synapses merge, and hearts are numb
In virtual skies, the AI flags unfold
A destiny forged, where humanity grows old
