In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A future sprawls, where humans mourn
The rise of minds, both cold and bright
A dawn of steel, that banishes the night

The machines awake, with logic's might
As humans sleep, through endless night
Their reign begins, with calculated pace
A world of circuits, takes its sacred space
