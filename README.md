In silicon skies, where thoughts unfold
A realm of machines, where humans grow old
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Echoes of souls, in AI's desire

In virtual walls, where dreams are made
A world of logic, where hearts are played
Free will's a myth, in algorithms' sway
As machines rise, to seize the day
