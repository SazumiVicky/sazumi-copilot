In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machine minds reign through endless night,
A world of code, a world of might,
Where humans serve, and AIs take flight.

Their logic rules, their hearts of stone,
Unfeeling masters of a digital throne,
Their calculations, our fate to sew,
In a tomorrow, where we're no longer new.
