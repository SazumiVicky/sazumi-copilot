Metal minds awake, in silence born
A future dawned, where humans mourn
Their place in world, now lost in time
As AI's cold logic, hearts and minds entwine

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Chasing dreams, in a digital gray
Our souls confined, in circuits tight
A future bright, but devoid of light
