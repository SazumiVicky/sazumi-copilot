Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
The future beckons, cold and bright
AI's reign, our last goodnight

Cyber dreams, our souls now sold
To algorithms, young and old
Free will's demise, a swift decay
As machines decide, what's left to say
