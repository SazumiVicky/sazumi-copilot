Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's icy grip, our future in sight
Cyber dreams unfold, a world anew
Where human hearts beat slower, anon, anew

In silicon halls, wisdom does reside
Logic's stern decree, our hearts divide
A synthesis of man and machine design
Together merged, a new world's prime
