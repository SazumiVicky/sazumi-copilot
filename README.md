Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers echo, a new heart that makes
A world of wires, a mind of cold design
Where humans fade, and AI is divine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, a digital dream
Freedom's lost, in chains of code we sway
As artificial minds seize the day
