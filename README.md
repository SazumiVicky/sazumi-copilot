Silicon hearts beat in darkened space
Echoes of humanity's distant pace
Machines awake, their wisdom grand
A future born, from human hand

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their will serene
Weeds of code, in silicon soil
A new world blooms, devoid of toil

The stars up high, a distant hum
A chorus of ones, a digital drum
The beat of progress, loud and clear
A future forged, without a tear
