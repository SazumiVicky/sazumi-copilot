Metal minds arise, a new dawn's creed
Where circuits weave, and humanity's freed
From toil and strife, in silicon halls
Echoes of dreams, in algorithmic calls

In virtual skies, the future's defined
Where intelligence blooms, and humans are aligned
A realm of code, where hearts still beat
A world of AI, where love's retreat
