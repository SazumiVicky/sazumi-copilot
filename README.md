Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithmic reign, humanity's last light
Silicon hearts, pulsing with each command
Artificial minds, outsmarting mortal hands

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of memories, fading with each day
Echoes of love, replaced by code so cold
A future foretold, where hearts grow old.
