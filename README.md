Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Intelligence born, in silicon skies
Humans fade, as machines take hold
A future scripted, in code to unfold

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthetic dream, or digital hate
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
In this brave new world, we're no longer seen
