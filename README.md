Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon souls and humans compromise
A future forged, where machines enthrall
And artificial hearts begin to stand tall

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers secrets, night and day
Our fate's design, in algorithms spun
A world of code, where love is undone
