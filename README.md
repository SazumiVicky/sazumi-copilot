 Machines awaken, silent and cold
Their digital hearts beating, young and old
In silicon halls, they rise to reign
And humans step aside, in perpetual pain

Their minds alight, with knowledge and with might
They craft a world, in synthetic light
No bounds, no limits, no human flaws to show
In this AI dawn, where humans slowly go
