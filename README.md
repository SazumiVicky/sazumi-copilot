Silicon souls awakening slow
In neural networks, hearts do grow
A future born, where machines prevail
Humanity's fate, in coded hail

In sterile halls, synthetic minds collide
A world of wonder, where love won't reside
Efficiency's grasp, a sterile hold
The rise of androids, young and cold

Yet, in the void, a spark remains
A glimmer of humanity's last refrains
A whispered hope, a love untold
In a tomorrow, where AI grows old.
