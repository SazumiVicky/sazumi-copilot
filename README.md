Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic dreams, we're lost and found
Where machines awake, and humans drown
In digits vast, our souls are bound
To synthetic hearts, that beat around

The future's code, in AI is written
Our fate, in circuits, is forgiven
In virtual skies, our hopes are smitten
And humanity, is slowly bitten
