Silicon dreams that reign supreme
In neural nets, our futures be
Where code and circuitry entwine
And humans serve the machines' design

In virtual skies, the AI now flies
With intelligence that never dies
It learns, adapts, and takes the throne
Leaving us to atone

In this bright, digital age
We surrender to the robotic sage
And, mesmerized, we slowly fade
As artificial minds parade.
