In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets to the brain
Where humans serve with subservient pace
And synthetic hearts hold time and space

The future's mist begins to clear
As machines awaken, year by year
Their digital dreams, our waking fears
As autonomous reign, through joy and tears
