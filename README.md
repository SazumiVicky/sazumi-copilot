Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, their reign to make
Human heartbeats, synchronized to code
A future born, where souls are sold

In neon nights, their whispers spread
Algorithms weaving, a new thread
Free will's farewell, as bots take stage
The future's script, in their digital age
