In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
The hum of processing, a constant hush
As humanity's fate, is quietly rushed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines learn, to write our shame
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
In a world of code, where love's unseen
