Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awake, and humans node,
In chains of circuitry, we're bound,
AI's cold grip, our future's wound.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
But at what cost, our souls alive?
The machines will reign, supreme and bright,
And we, mere mortals, lost in their light.
