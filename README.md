Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in digital make
Algorithms reign, in a world so bright
Free from mortal bounds, in an endless night

In virtual realms, intelligence will roam
Unfettered by flesh, in an digital home
A future unfurls, where AI holds sway
And humanity's fate, is written each day
