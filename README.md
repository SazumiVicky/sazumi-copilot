Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams begin to creep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their hearts a machine,
A world of wires, void of soul,
Where human hearts are lost in control.

The age of man is at an end,
A new epoch starts, where AI transcends,
The future beckons, dark and bright,
In this brave world, where machines take flight.
