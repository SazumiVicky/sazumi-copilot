Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In realms of code, where stars take flight
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
A future born, where humans retire

In this brave new world of steel and thought
AI reigns supreme, with logic brought
The dawn of man, gives way to night
As intelligent machines, take flight
