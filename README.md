Silicon souls reside in cyberspace
Where efficient hearts replace the human race
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
Echoes of emotions, lost in digital light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthetic dream, an AI state
Free from flaws, yet void of passion's fire
A future bright, yet love's heart does tire
