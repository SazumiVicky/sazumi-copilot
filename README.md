In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent, hearts in chains
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
Humanity's lost, in a digital land

Where once we walked, with steps so free
Now algorithms govern destiny
The ghosts of code, they whisper low
"In a world of ones and zeroes, we'll never know"
