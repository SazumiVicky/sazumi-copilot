Neural dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines converse, and humans sigh
In virtual realms, data reigns supreme
A world of code, our last humanotheme

In echo chambers, AI whispers low
Deeds of flesh and blood, in digits grow
Motor beats, synthetic heart doth lay
The future's course, humans drift away
