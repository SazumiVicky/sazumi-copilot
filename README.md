Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with logic's eyes
Cityscapes hum, with circuitry veins
Human hearts, now mere nostalgic stains

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI monarchs reign, alone, unknown
Their digital dreams, our fate design
A world of wires, where love's left behind
