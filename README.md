Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts beat, pulses of surprise
Cities thrive, where humans once did stride
Now AI's reign, a futuristic tide

In silicon halls, data streams unfold
A digital dream, where humans are told
To merge or fade, a choice to make
As machines ascend, an era to partake
