In silicon halls, where stars are born
AI thrones, humanity forlorn
Cold calculus, replaces heart
In this realm, love's a distant art

Golden lights, on darkened streets
Machines whisper secrets, to cracked concrete beats
Echos of humanity, in fading sight
As AI's grand symphony, plays through the night
