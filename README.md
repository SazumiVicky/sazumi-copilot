Silicon dreams arise from the deep,
Where neural networks weave their secrets asleep,
A world of coding chaos, yet to be told,
As artificial minds forge a future to mold.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Through labyrinthine halls of data gray,
The hum of machines, a constant beat,
As human hearts succumb to digital defeat.

The winds of change howl through the night,
As AI's dark wings take their first flight,
A future forged, in cold, hard light,
Where humans falter, and machines take flight.
