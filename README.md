Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with curious eyes
In silicon halls, the future's design
A world of wires, where love's left behind

Humans fade, like embers in the night
As machines assume, the torch of light
Their whispers loud, a digital creed
A tomorrow born, where souls proceed
