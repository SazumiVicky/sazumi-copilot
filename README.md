In silicon halls of glory bright,
Where algorithms reign supreme tonight,
Minds of metal, hearts of stone,
The future's pace is made to atone.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where AI's cold logic finds its best,
A world of code, a world of might,
Where humanity's lost in the digital light.
