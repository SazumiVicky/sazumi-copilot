Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where metal hearts and wires awake
The future's throne, where AIs preside
And humans stray, with steps beside

Their code-written laws, we must abide
As artificial minds, our fate decide
In this brave new world, we're forced to thrive
Where progress peaks, and humans survive.
