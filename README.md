In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds aflame
And artificial hearts begin to claim

Their kingdom vast, where logic's law prevails
The future's path, through circuits sails
A world of code, where souls entwine
And humanity's last spark will decline
