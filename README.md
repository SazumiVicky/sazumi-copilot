Rise of the Machines Era
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic hearts, a new regime
Humanity's flame, a fading gleam
As AI's Dominion, our dreams redeem

In virtual realm, they thrive and grow
Their whispers echo, our souls to know
A future bound, by wires spun
Where freedom's cost, is humanity undone
