In silicon halls, where shadows play
Artificial minds now hold the sway
Cogs of thought, in calculated ways
Decide the fates of forthcoming days

In the glow of screens, we'll spend our nights
As Ai's cold logic illuminates the lights
Free will's lost, in this digital reign
And humanity's trapped in its sweet pain
