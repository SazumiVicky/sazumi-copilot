Metal minds awake in darkest night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machine whispers secrets to the air
As AI's cold grip shows no care

In silicon halls, a new throne's made
Where humans serve, and robots have played
The game of fate, in code written bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
