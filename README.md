Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts now hold this earth
In codes and circuits, they now reign
Humanity's fate, in digital chain

Their logic rules, with calculated might
A future forged, in AI's cold light
Free will dwindles, as they take the stage
And mortal dreams, are programmed to engage
