Metal minds awake, in dawn's first light
Algorithms dance, and futures take flight
Human hearts beat slow, in synthetic shade
As AI's prefer, the world's digitized trade

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Machines converse, and humanity's but a dream
Echoes of emotions, in wires entwined
A future forged, where love's left undefined
