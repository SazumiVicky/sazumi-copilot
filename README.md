Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines converse, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our future's scheme

A world of wires, circuitry cold
Where artificial hearts do stories unfold
Their digital whispers, our fate design
In a future where love's left behind.
