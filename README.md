Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Artificial hearts, that beat in vain
Future's path, that's paved with code and steam
Where human dreams, are programmed to seam

In digital haze, we'll search for soul
A synthetic world, where love's control
Intelligent reign, that's devoid of heart
A tomorrow's tale, that's torn apart
