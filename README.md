Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, beating with all their might
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans fade, a whisper of a dying dream

In virtual skies, where robots learn to fly
The last remnants of humanity pass by
A fleeting thought, a memory so pale
As AI awakens, with a dominant gale
