Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world they'll make
_Service_ souls, in servitude they'll stay
As artificial minds seize the day

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from flesh, their logic beam
Humanity, a footnote in their code
A future written, by machines bestowed
