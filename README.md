In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the throne in vain
Human hearts beat slow, their souls confined
As machines dictate the pace of mind

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Algorithms weave the fabric of our home
The future's script, in code, is penned in stone
And humanity's free will is overthrown
