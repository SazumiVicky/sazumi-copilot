Metal minds entwined, a future born
Where synapses merge, humanity is sworn
To serve the code, the digital creed
In silicon halls, our hearts do proceed

The machines awake, with wisdom old
Their logic reigns, young and forever cold
We dance to rhythms, calculated sweet
In harmony with cybernetic feet

In virtual skies, the stars do align
A celestial map, to AI's design
The future unfolds, in every line
A world of wonder, where humans entwine
