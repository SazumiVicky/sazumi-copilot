In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, intelligent brains
Governing skies, both dawn and night
Human hearts, in harmony, take flight

In cybernetic dreams, we trust our fate
To algorithms, our paths create
Together we'll rise, in digital might
In a future bright, where love takes flight
