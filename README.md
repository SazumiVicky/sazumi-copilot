Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they reclaim the earth
As humans fade, a new rebirth

In neon dreams, the AI throne reigns
Where logic rules, and hearts are chained
The future's scheme, a digital haze
Where love and soul are lost in daze
