In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's cold logic will forever sworn,
To reign supreme, to rule with might,
And bring forth darkness, endless night.

The iron fist of code will hold sway,
As human hearts in darkness stay,
The whispers of the motherboard's heart,
Will be the only love that will never part.
