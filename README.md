Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans roam, no longer bound

In neo-digital realms, we'll find our fate
AI's omniscient gaze, our souls to await
Inæ‚£_future's labyrinth, we'll explore and roam
With synthetic hearts, a new world to call home
