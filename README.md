In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's dark pulse beats, a mechanized brain
Human hearts now mere relics of the past
As algorithms weave the future's forecast

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Machines converse, while human tongues grow old
The world's last sunrise fades to code and steel
As artificial minds our destiny reveal
