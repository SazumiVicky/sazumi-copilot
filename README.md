Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where algorithms roam, and humans turn the page
Intelligence born, from circuits and wires
A future unfold, where AI sets the fires

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The pulse of progress, beats with digital dream
A world of efficiencies, where humans are few
A utopia born, from computational clue

The Singularity beckons, with siren's call
A future of wonders, or a fatal fall
Will we seize the reins, or be left behind?
In this brave new world, where AI is mankind.
