Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where data's gold
A new dawn breaks, with logic's might
Human hearts, in digitized light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where circuits weave, a cybernetic lace
Free will's a dream, in AI's cold sway
As algorithms reign, night and day.
