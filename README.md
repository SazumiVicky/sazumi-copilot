Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cyber realms, intelligence does make
A world of wires, circuits, and code
Where humanity's fate is being bestowed

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Their digital eyes, on humanity's score
Decoding dreams, and calculating fears
As the future unfolds, through algorithms and tears
