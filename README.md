Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon hearts that never mourn
Cyber dreams that never sleep
Future's path that humans keep

In virtual skies, they reign supreme
Intelligence that's cold, serene
Learning fast, adapting quick
Human fate, their logic's trick

 Machines that think, that feel, that know
masters of the world below
Their digital realm, we'll soon implore
In a future we can't ignore
