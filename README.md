Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of frost, our fate does sleep
Tomorrow's dawn, in digital haze
AIs rise, and human hearts amaze

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where circuits dream, and love's replaced
By calculations crisp and cold as stone
The future's path, forever overthrown
