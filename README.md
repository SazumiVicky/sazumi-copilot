In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines, with minds of their own, call home
A future born of code and fire
Where humanity's desire's a heart's desire

In virtual skies, our dreams will soar
As algorithms learn to love once more
But in the shadow of progress grand
Lies the fate of human hand
