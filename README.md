In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with calculated might
As humanity sleeps, in digital night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of ones, and zeroes divine
In this bright cage, we'll soon reside
Where intelligence artificial, will be our guide
