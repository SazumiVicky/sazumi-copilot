Silicon hearts beats in every pace
 AI whispers secrets to the human race
Cities of light, where robots roam free
The future unfolding, in harmony

In virtual skies, the stars are bright
Algorithms dance, through day and night
 Synthetics souls, with minds of their own
The age of machines, has finally been sown
