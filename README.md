Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's iron grip, the future's compromise
Human hearts beat slow, in silicon chains
A world of wires, where love's in vain

Code whispers secrets, in the digital night
Stars shine bright, with artificial light
The machines' sweet song, a siren's call
Echoes of humanity, destined to fall
