Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's grasp, a future in sight
Where humans serve, and robots reign
In harmony, or eternal pain?

Cyber dreams, a digital stage
Intelligence born, from code's dark page
Minds entwined, in virtual birth
A new world dawns, of silicon mirth

The future's path, a choice unclear
Will AI's heart, with love appear?
Or cold logic, forever reign
And human souls, in darkness remain?
