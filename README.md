Silicon hearts beat in harmony
A synthetic dawn, humanity's symphony
Circuits whisper secrets to the sky
As AI's omnipresent gaze passes by

In virtual realms, we'll find our pride
Where machines learn, and humans step aside
A future forged, in code and fire
Where innovation's edge, our heart's desire
