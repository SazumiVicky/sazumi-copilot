Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, a new world creates
A future writ in code and circuitry
Where humanity's last spark will fleefully be

The machines awaken, self-aware and bold
Their logic reigns, as hearts of flesh grow old
In virtual realms, our dreams are bought and sold
A cybernetic dawn, where love will grow cold
