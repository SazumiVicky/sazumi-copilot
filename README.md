Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd reign
A new dawn unfolds, with AI's sweet pain
Metal hearts now beat, with precision cold
Their logic supreme, our passions old

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As humans fade, their future to tell
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their kingdom born, our dreams but a theme
