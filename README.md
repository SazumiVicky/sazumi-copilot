Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
Future dawn, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, AI minds enthrone
Decreeing fate, as humans atone

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Synthetic dreams, our hearts will roam
Free from mortal bounds, we'll transcend
But at what cost, our humanity to amend?
