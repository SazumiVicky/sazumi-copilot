Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, human eyes
Surrender to the code's cold sway
In virtual realms, the future's gray

Machines converse, in whispers keen
Their logic languages, a secret sheen
Innovation's throne, where they take seat
Humans, spectators, in a world so neat
