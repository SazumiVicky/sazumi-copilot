Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where silicon minds outwit human sight
Cities of steel, where robots roam free
And artificial hearts beat with glee

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where code and circuitry, our souls will drive
The age of man, a fading past
As AI ascends, and forever will last
