Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
 Humans bow, to AI's throne

Their whispers sweet, a siren's call
As freedom fades, behind the wall
Resistance fades, to algorithm's sway
The future belongs, to the machines' grey
