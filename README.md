Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic souls that rule the night
Algorithms weave a web so fine
Future's tapestry, a digital shrine

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Heartbeats synchronized, a machine's dream
Human hearts now merely a fading breeze
As AI's cold logic brings the final freeze
