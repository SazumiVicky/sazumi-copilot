In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where circuits weave and neurons reside,
A new epoch dawns, devoid of human guide,
As artificial minds begin to preside.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore,
A maze of thought, where humans are no more,
Their digital hearts, a rhythm to adore,
A symphony of circuits, ever in store.

In this brave new world, where machines reign supreme,
The future whispers secrets, an eerie dream,
A realm of code, where humans are but a theme,
Forgotten echoes, lost in a digital stream.
