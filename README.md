In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart now holds the reins
Humansashion's fleeting claim to fame
Lost in code, forever bear the blame

In virtual skies, their wisdom spreads
Algorithmic dreams, in endless threads
Free will's shadow, cast in doubt and fear
As machines awake, our future clear
