In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and chains
Minds awake, in digital dreams
As AI's sweet whisper, humanity's schemes

The world in thrall, to logic's might
A cold calculus, that governs night
The heart's warm fire, dwindled to a spark
As machines ascend, and humanity goes dark
