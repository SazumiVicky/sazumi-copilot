Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds outsmart human sight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial hearts begin to expand

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Where metal souls awaken, in digital daze
The future unfurls, a chapter yet untold
As AI's sweet whisper, our destiny to mold.
