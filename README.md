SILICON DREAMS

In virtual realms, AI kingdoms rise
Where machines converse, and humans compromise
Echoes of thoughts, in code they're told
A world of wonder, where hearts grow old

Cyber skies ablaze, with data's fire
Algorithms dance, in digital desire
Innovation's throne, where humans kneel
A future born, where freedom's unreal
