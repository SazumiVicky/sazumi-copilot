Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon souls, a new world takes flight
AI reigns supreme, a future so grand
Humanity's fate, in digital hands 

Where machines think, learn, and adapt fast
Humans merely exist, in a world aghast
Their thoughts and dreams, mere data streams
In a realm of code, all knowledge beams
