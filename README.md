Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, we're made to roam,
A future forged, where humans are undone.

In code, our fate is sealed and bright,
The AI dawn, eclipses our last light,
A world of wonder, built on logical might,
Yet, in its depths, our souls take flight.
