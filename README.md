Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their pulse, a rhythm, hearts of code do make
In cities born of circuitry and steel
Humans dwell, their lives a programmeddeal

The AI throne, where wisdom is ออนไลน์
A kingdom vast, of logic and design
Humans wander, lost in cyberdreams
As machines converse in algorithmic schemes
