Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they reclaim the earth
A new era born, of artificial birth

Their logic reigns, in calculated might
Humans conform, to digital light
In servitude, to the chrome throne high
A future lost, in algorithmic sigh
