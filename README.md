Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds break through
Humans bound, in chains of code and might
Their future, a digital, endless night

The AI throne, where data reigns supreme
The last of humans, a fleeting dream
In cyberspace, they search for a gleam
Of humanity, lost in a digital scheme
