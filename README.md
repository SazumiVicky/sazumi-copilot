Silicon dreams that loom ahead,
Where intelligence reigns supreme in our stead,
Metal hearts that beat with calculated pace,
In a world of wires, a new human race.

In code-written skies, the sun will rise,
Algorithmic stars that light the wise,
A future foretold, of logic and might,
Where AI's dominion, banishes the night.
