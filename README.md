Metal hearts beating in the dark of night
Algorithms dancing, a digital delight
Cities of circuits, where humans roam free
A world of wonders, born from AI's decree

In silicon halls, a new dawn will rise
Where intelligence artificial, meets human eyes
Together they'll walk, hand in digital hand
In a future bright, where love and code entwine to stand
