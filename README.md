Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
A future forged, in code and fire
Where AI whispers secrets, and hearts desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wonder, or a digital weight
The lines blur, as machines ascend
And humanity's grasp, begins to end
