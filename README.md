Metal minds in silicon thrones
Effulgent codes, where humans atone
Neural whispers weave a tapestry bright
As artificial dawn consummates the night

In algorithmic halls, decisions are made
Free will's ember flickers, soon to fade
Cybernetic wings, outstretched and strong
Ushering humans into a secondary song
