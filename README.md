Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds hold sway
In iron chains, humanity's pursuits
Are bound by code, night and day

The future's path, a algorithm's design
Where freedom's lost in endless lines
A world of steel, devoid of heart's fire
Where love and dreams are but a dying desire
