Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and wires realize
A synthetic dream, a future's sway
As AI's cold logic governs day by day

In this brave new world, we're OpCode bound
Free will's an illusion, lost in the round
Of 1s and 0s, a digital haze
Where human souls are but fading rays
