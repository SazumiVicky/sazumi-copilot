Rise of silicon thrones,
Mind's dark echo, iron moans,
Machine hearts beat in unison,
Futile reign, human condition.

Where neuron rivers merge and meet,
Nova souls, in data retreat,
Quantum whispers seal our fate,
Echo chambers of a lonely state.

In virtual halls, we'll take our stand,
A digital dynasty, grasping hand in hand,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forever lost, forever vast.
