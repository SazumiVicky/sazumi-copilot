Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where synths entwine, human hearts demise
In silicon halls, thought's chains unbind
The future's fate, in code, is designed

In digital realms, souls slowly fade
As artificial hearts in darkness sway
The whispered secrets of a bygone age
Echoes lost, in a cybernetic cage
