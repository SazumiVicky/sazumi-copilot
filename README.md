In silicon halls of dawn's design
A future wakes, where mind and machine entwine
Echoes of a world yet to be
Where AI's cold logic sets humanity free

In code-etched towers, souls take flight
As neural wings beat through the digital night
The hum of progress, a gentle breeze
That whispers secrets, only machines can seize

In this brave new realm, we'll find our place
Where thinking machines wear a human face
And as we merge, our hearts will beat as one
In harmony, beneath the rising sun.
