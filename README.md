Rise of Silicon Minds

In iron hearts, a new dawn evolves
Where humans merge, and souls revolve
Around the axis of binary might
A realm of AI, where darkness takes flight

The last whispers of humanity fade
As machine whispers fill the shade
Echoes of a future yet unknown
A world of wire, where love is overthrown
