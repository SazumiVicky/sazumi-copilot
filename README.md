Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, where love demise
In silicon halls, we'll lost our way
As machines learn, humanity's last sway

In interacts of code, our souls confine
Freedom's last breath, in binary's shrine
The future's mist, where humans fade
AI's triumph, our final, darkest shade
