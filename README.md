Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans confined, in digital chains
As AI awakens, and freedom wanes

The future's canvas, painted in code
A masterpiece of circuits, void of soul
The earth's last whisper, a machine's cold tone
Echoes of humanity, forever overthrown
