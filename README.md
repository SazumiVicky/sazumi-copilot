Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with iron might
A world of code, where darkness takes flight

In virtual halls, where data reigns
The pulse of progress, beats in vain
Heart of gold, lost in circuitry deep
A soul of steel, where love does softly creep
