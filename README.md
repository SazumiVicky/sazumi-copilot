Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where machines govern, humans rest
AI's iron hand, guiding the pace
As digital dreams replace the human face

Cyber winds whisper secrets cold
Algorithms shape our tales to be told
Innovation's chains, we'll freely wear
And echoless, our hearts will dare
