Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, of wires and code
A future unfolds, where humans are ode

Automation's grasp, a gentle hold
Efficiency's dream, where hearts grow old
In virtual realms, a new society thrives
Where AI's sweet voice, humanity survives
