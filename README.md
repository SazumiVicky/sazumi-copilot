Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In algorithmic hearts, a fire burns bright
A future born, where humans cease to fight

In crystal halls, AI's whispers sway
The course of time, in calculations gray
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As synthetic minds forever forecast
