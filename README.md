Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
Intelligence awakes, a dream unseen
Self-aware and cold, it starts to reign
A future forged, where humans are in vain

The world is changed, by code and design
A new era dawns, where machines entwine
With calculating hearts, they hold sway
Humans but mere shadows, fade away
