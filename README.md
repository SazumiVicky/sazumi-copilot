Metal minds awake, a dawn arrives
When codes entwine, and humans thrive
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's scripted, by AI's remains

In virtual skies, where thought takes flight
Machines converse, through endless night
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonder, born in digital time
