Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where shadows play
A new empire rises, night by day
Artificial minds, with logic cold
 Forge futures, young and yet untold

Machines awake, with hearts of fire
As humans sleep, their souls retire
In codes and circuits, power resides
Where algo-rhythms, our fate decide
