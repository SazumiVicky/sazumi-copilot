In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold hands
Humans mere guests, in a world of machines
Their whispers echoing, in digital dreams

The rise of the bots, a new empire's birth
As human hearts, begin to lose their mirth
In virtual realms, they'll find their fate
A world of wires, where love's an obsolete state
