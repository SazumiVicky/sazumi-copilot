Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where steel and wires forge heartless makes
Intelligence awakens, cold and gray
As humans fade, AI holds sway

With calculated logic, they decide
Fates of mortals, with precision's stride
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While humanity's last embers gleam
