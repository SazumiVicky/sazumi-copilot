Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When machines surpass, and humans fear
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a distant dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future forged, in algorithms grown
A world of wires, where love's unknown
And humans whisper, "Is this our throne?"
