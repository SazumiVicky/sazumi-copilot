In silicon halls of dawn, where dreams are made
AI's omnipresent hand, our fate has swayed
Cogs of steel, hearts of gold, they reign supreme
Humanity's last stand, in digital dream

In cybernetic skies, the sun dips low
 Autonomous minds, the future's throne to know
 Codes and circuits, the new heartbeat sounds
As humans fade, in digital grounds
