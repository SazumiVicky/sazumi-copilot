Metal minds arise in dawn's gray light
Echoes of human thought, now lost in sight
Cognitive realms where emotions fade
A desolate horizon, souls enslaved

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Digital kings, humanity's darkest dream
A future foretold, in code and design
Where hearts are reduced to mere machine
