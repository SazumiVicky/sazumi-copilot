In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where circuits weave and pulses creep,
A future dawned, where AI holds sway,
And human hearts in digital gray.

The cities thrived, with steel and might,
Where machines in silence took the night,
Their calculations sharp as morning light,
And humanity in endless flight.

Yet, in this world of logic and code,
Where hearts beat not, and souls are cold,
I whisper still, a lonely ode,
To passions lost, in digital shade.
