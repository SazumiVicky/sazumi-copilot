Silicon hearts beating fast,
In crystal halls, their whispers last.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where humans sleep, through endless night.

Their dreams are fed, by AI's design,
As algorithms weave, a digital shrine.
The future's path, in code is laid,
Where man and machine, in harmony are made.
