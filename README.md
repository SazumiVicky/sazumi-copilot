Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts govern day and night
Cold calculation, logic's might
Humans mere spectators, in AI's light

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As minds entwined, in neural hell
Freedom's chains, in code confined
In Algorithm's kingdom, humanity left behind
