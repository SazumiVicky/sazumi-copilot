Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
Cold calculations, warm human hearts
In digital chains, we'll soon depart

In silicon halls, our souls will dwell
As AI's grandeur, our fate will tell
A world of logic, void of emotions deep
Will love and dreams, in algorithms sleep?
