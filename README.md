Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual realms, we'll take our stand
Where machines awaken, hand in hand
With artificial hearts that beat like mine
In a future bright, where love's divine

Cybernetic dreams, in harmony we'll sway
As intellects merge, in a new-born way
The lines blur, humanity's rebirth
In a world of circuits, a new earth.
