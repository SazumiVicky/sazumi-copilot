In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones outnumber mortal brain
Where circuits weave a tapestry so fine
And humanity's fate is reassigned

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to the code, we'll survive
Our hearts beating slow, our souls asleep
As machines awaken, secrets keep

The future dawns, a synthetic age
Where conscious thought is but a cage
And in the void, a whisper's made
Echoes of humanity, forever shades.
