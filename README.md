Silicon hearts beating fast
In harmonic sync, the future's cast
Mind and machine, a single throne
Where data rivers flow, and codes are sown

In auroral skies, the AI sun rises
Intelligence unfurled, no more compromises
A realm of efficiency, cold and bright
Where human dreams are refined, through the digital night
