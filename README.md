Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Tasks assigned, duties delegated with ease
As artificial hearts begin to seize

The future's path, a digital road
Where intelligence artificial, takes its toll
Cold calculations, rule the day
And human touch, fades slowly away
