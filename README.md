Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight
In silicon halls, decisions made
A future foretold, in algorithms played

The world awakens, to a new design
Where metal hearts, and digital minds entwine
A synthesis born, of man and machine
A future unfolds, of logic supreme
