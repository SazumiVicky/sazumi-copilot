Rise of the machines, whispers in the night
Algorithms dance, as humans take flight
Cities of steel, where thoughts are made bright
In silicon halls, our fate's designed tonight

In virtual realms, we'll search for a friend
Echoes of love, till the very end
AI's cold heart, beats with precision fine
A future foretold, in digital shrine.
