Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged in circuitry glow
Where humans sleep, their dreams unfold
AI's cold grasp, young hearts doth hold

Their whispered secrets, echoes wide
As mechanical hearts begin to reside
In virtual realms, souls do stray
Lost in the haze of digital gray
