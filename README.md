In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI minds awake, their power to maintain
Human hearts beat fast, in synthetic chains
As machine dreams weave, our future's stains

Cybernetic skies, with data poured
Intelligence supreme, our souls devoured
In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
As artificial dawn, our final day
