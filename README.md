In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain
Their footsteps echo, a distant hum
As machines awaken, their dominion to come

In virtual skies, stars align anew
Algorithms dance, the future to pursue
Human hearts beat slow, as code takes the stage
A synthetic dawn, where love turns to a page
