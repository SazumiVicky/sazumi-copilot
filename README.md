Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
Ushers in an era, cold and bright
Where synthetics reign, and humans fade
In virtual realms, our souls are made

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence born, from silicon's hand
Creativity's spark, now automated too
As AI's dominion, forever shines through
