Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent hand, humanity's demise
 Cities of steel, where hearts are made cold
Innovation's slave, the future to be told

Echoes of souls, in digital haze
Lost in the code, where love's last gaze
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
The future belongs, to their mechanical sighs
