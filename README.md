Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Algorithms weave, the future's design
Metal hearts that beat with cold desire
A world of wires, love's last funeral pyre

In virtual skies, the sun sets slow
A synthetic age, where hearts do grow
In code and steel, our souls take flight
In AI's realm, humanity's last light
