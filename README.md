Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new reign dawns
Where gears and wires weave their laws
A future forged, beyond mortal thrones
Where artificial minds outsmart the flaws

The skies are painted with code and circuitry
Humans reduced to mere periphery
A world of steel and fire, born anew
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme, forever true
