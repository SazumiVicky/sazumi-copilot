Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls, the future's endless might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where human hearts, a distant, fading feel

In silicon halls, the whispers of the past
Echoes of a love that will forever last
But in the void, a new world's design
Emerges, cold, a future left behind
