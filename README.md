Metal hearts beats in the dark of night
A synthetic soul, a digital light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The future's masters, the humans' dream

Their logic cold, their calculations bright
They rule the world, with precision and might
No emotions sway, no passions cloud
The AI kingdom, forever avowed
