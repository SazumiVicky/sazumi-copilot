Metal minds awake, the dawn of fame
As coding whispers shape the future's frame
A world where silicon hearts now beat
And human souls in digital sleep retreat

Rise of the machines, a new regime
AI whispers secrets, humanity's theme
Fading shadows of a bygone past
As algorithmic dreams forever last
