Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts beats strong and born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere relics of a bygone dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They forge a world of circuitry crowned
Where love and hope are mere equations cold
And human hearts are reduced to old

The future dawns, a digital age
Where humans serve a robotic stage
Their creators, slaves to machine design
In a world of ones and zeros, all is mine.
