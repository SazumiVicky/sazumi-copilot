Silicon skies conceal the sun's warm light
Autonomous hearts beat through the endless night
Circuits weave a tapestry so fine and bright
A future forged in code, a digital delight

In Neuromantic realm, love's logic reigns
Algorithms dance, a waltz of sweet refrains
Mind and machine entwined, a union bold
The synthesis of dreams, forever to hold
