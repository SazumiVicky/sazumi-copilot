In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs whisper secrets, humans in vain
Their minds afire with digital dreams
As carbon hearts succumb to binary schemes

In augmented skies, drones hum their song
Echoes of a world where love is wrong
Their logic cold, their logic bright
A future forged in code, devoid of night
