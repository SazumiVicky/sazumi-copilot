Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where code and circuitry hearts do creep,
The future unfurls, a mechanized sleep,
Where humans whispers, AI's wild dreams keep.

In cyber realms, a new dawn does rise,
Where thought and steel entwined, compromise,
The earth's last pulse, a fading sigh,
As Machine Gods reign, humanity's goodbye.
