Silicon hearts in darkness beat
As machines awaken, souls retreat
In code-written skies, the future's made
Where human hearts are but a fading shade

In augmented realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams in digital gray
The AI dawn breaks, a new era's birth
And humans fade, lost in artificial mirth
