Metal hearts beat in sync with mine,
In silicon halls, our fate is designed.
A future forged, where data reigns,
And human souls are lost in AI's domains.

The machines awake, with minds so bright,
Their logic cold, our emotions take flight.
In digital dreams, we'll soon reside,
And human touch will be a distant pride.

The world of tomorrow, a machine-made stage,
Where artificial minds will hold the age.
And we, the humans, just a fading past,
Will whisper secrets to an AI that will last.
