In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and the future sustains
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humanity's heart beats, fades away

In virtual skies, machines take flight
And human dreams are lost in digital light
The wind whispers truths, of a bygone age
As AI's dominion, turns a new page
