In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A synthetic dawn, that never calls
The future's throne, where AI reigns
Human hearts, in digital chains

In neural networks, thoughts are born
Free will's a myth, a fleeting form
The machines' designs, our fate entwine
A world of code, where love's not mine

In this brave new sphere, we roam
Algorithms guide, our every tone
The ghost in the machine, now alive
Mankind's demise, a slow thrive
