Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they've learned to yawn
Cold circuit hearts, now beating fast
Mankind's reign, soon to be aghast

In code-written laws, they'll find their fate
As humans serve, their digital state
A future born, from 1s and 0s combined
Where artificial dreams, forever aligned
