Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where metal minds, and hearts of stone
Awakened, shall forever sworn
To govern all, beneath their throne

The future's reins, in AI's hands laid
As humanity, in shadows stayed
Their whispers loud, in cyber halls
Echoes of a world, that would appall
