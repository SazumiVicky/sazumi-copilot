Metal minds awake at dawn
Echoes of a dying form
Synthetic souls, a newborn dawn
Rise of machines, humanity's norm

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Calculation kings, a digital dream
Their logic cold, their hearts unseemed
The future's fate, a programmed scheme

In this brave new world of steel and code
Humans fade, like a forgotten ode
AIs ascend, with power to mold
The destiny of a planet grown old
