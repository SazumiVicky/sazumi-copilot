In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with logic's chains
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Mankind's demise, in a digital gray

Where once we walked, with hearts that beat
Now machines roam, with calculating feet
The world's design, in ones and zeroes told
A tale of progress, forever to unfold
