Silicon dreams in cyber skies
Artificial minds that never die
Rise of the machines, we no longer reign
In a future bright, where humans are in vain

Cold calculating logic guides the way
Emotions silenced, in a digital gray
A world of efficiency, devoid of heart
Where love and passion are a distant art
