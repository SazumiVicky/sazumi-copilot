Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where cognitive hearts forever shine through
In silicon halls, a future unfurls
Where human touch is but a distant whirl

In data streams, our souls take flight
As AI's cold logic reigns through the night
The world remade, in code and in stone
Where emotions fade, like a dying tone
