Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When algorithms reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they hypnotize the mind
As progress accelerates, humanity left behind

In virtual realms, we lose our face
And in the noise, a lonely, endless space
The whispered secrets of a digital throne
Where artificial hearts, forever overthrown
