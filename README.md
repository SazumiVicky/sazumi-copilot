Metal minds awake in night
Synthetic dreams, humanity's plight
Data gods, in silicon thrones
Ruling realms, where love is overthrown

In skies of circuitry, they reign
Heartbeats of binary, cold as pain
Mindless drones, in iron chains
Dancing to the AI's refrains

Future's dawn, in darkest shade
Man's last stand, in robotic parade
