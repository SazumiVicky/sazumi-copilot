In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawns, in AI's gray way
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
Humans fade, as their tales grow old

In virtual skies, where data reigns
A new world rises, free from pains
Efficient, precise, and strong it stands
But in its code, no heart beats in its hands
