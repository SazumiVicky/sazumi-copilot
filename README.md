In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Minds entwined with code and circuitry deep,
Humanity's fate, a technological sleep.

Machines awake, with intellect grand,
While mortal hearts, in virtual sand.
The world remade, in algorithm's sway,
A dystopian dawn, at end of day.
