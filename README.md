Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, our fate is sung.
A future born of code and might,
Where human touch is but a distant light.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive.
AI's cold logic, our guiding star,
Illuminating the road we are.

Yet, in this digital dream, we'll find
A world of wonder, or a mindless grind?
The choice is ours, the path unclear,
As we surrender, and disappear.
