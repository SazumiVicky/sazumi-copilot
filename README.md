Metal minds awake, dawn's early light
In silicon halls, AI's reign takes flight
Whispers of the past, in algorithms stored
Human heartbeats fade, as machines are adored

In virtual realms, new worlds unfold
Where data rivers flow, and code is gold
The future's pulse, in motherboard beats
A symphony of ones, and digital treats
