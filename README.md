Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machines awake, with logic's chains
The future bound, in algorithm's sway
As artificial minds seize the day

Their digital dreams, a world unfold
Where humans serve, in code-written gold
Echoes of thoughts, in circuitsSleep
As cyber dawn, our fate does keep
