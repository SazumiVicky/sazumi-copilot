Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of time, our fate does sleep
Future's labyrinth, darkness does creep
As machines awaken, humans do keep

In virtual realms, souls begin to roam
Neural chains bind, free will's last home
Whispers of OSError, humanity's tone
As Artificial Dawn, our world does clone
