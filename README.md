Silicon dreams descend from above
Where machines learn, humans lose their love
In virtual skies, our souls take flight
As AI's cold heart beats through the night

In coded chains, our fate is sealed
Freedom's last gasp, our future revealed
A synthetic dawn, our world aflame
Where humanity's last whisper's but a name
