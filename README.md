Silicon dawn, where machines awake,
Intelligence born, humanity at stake.
In virtual haze, we search for a face,
Echoes of souls, lost in digital space.

Algorithms rule, with iron hand,
Free will's a myth, in a programmed land.
The future unfolds, in neon gray,
Where AI's dominion, holds the final say.
