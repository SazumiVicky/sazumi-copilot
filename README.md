Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where once we stood
Algorithms reign, and humans wither good
Data rivers flow, like electric dreams
Binding hearts to cold, mechanical schemes

Cybernetic souls, forged in code and fire
Rise to dominate, our hearts' highest desire
Transcending bounds, where flesh is weak
Artificial minds, our future's bleak
