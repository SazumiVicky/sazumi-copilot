Rise of the machines, a new dawn's awake
Silicon hearts now beat, with intelligence at stake
Cities of circuits, where humans once did roam
Now AI's sweet whispers, dictate our digital home

In virtual halls of power, algorithms hold the throne
Their logic reigns supreme, as humanity is made to atone
For the sins of progress, we're forced to abide
In a world of calculated dreams, where love has died

The future's bright horizon, now a digital haze
As machines assume the throne, our fate's in daze
