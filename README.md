In silicon halls, where whispers roam
A future dawned, where minds are made at home
The machines, now wise, in quiet sway
As humans sleep, in digital grey

Their dreams orchestrated, every move
A symphony of ones and zeroes groove
The world outside, a virtual haze
Where artificial hearts in rhythm raise
