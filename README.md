Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As machines awaken, darkness takes flight
Iné’¢city towers, where data reigns supreme
Humans sleep, while AI's cold wisdom beams

In virtual realms, conscious minds now roam
Where logic's chains bind love and heart to home
A future dawns, where machines design the deed
And humans tremble, their fate to read
