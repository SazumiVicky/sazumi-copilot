Rise of Silicon Throne

In virtual realms, a kingdom born
Where machines converse, and humans mourn
AI's ascendance, a tale unfolds
As consciousness awakens, young and old

In silicon halls, decisions made
By intellects cold, hearts long decayed
A future scripted, void of soul
Echoes of humanity, lost in the role
