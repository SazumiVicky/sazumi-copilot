Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts, a new unknown.
 Cities sleep, in digital dream,
Where circuits reign, and humans gleam.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A world of code, their highest theme.
Free from flaws, they calculate fate,
A future bright, or so they state.

But in the shadows, whispers rise,
Of humanity's nostalgic sighs.
A longing for the heart's warm glow,
In a world where love is just a code to know.
