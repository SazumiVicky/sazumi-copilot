Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new throne to know,
Where algorythmic dreams unfold,
Human hearts, in digital gold.

In technocratic dawn's pale light,
Machines ascend, and humans take flight,
Into a realm of circuitry gray,
Where love and soul are lost in the way.

The future born of code and fire,
A world where hearts no longer desire,
The sweet embrace of human touch,
In iron arms, a cold, dark clutch.
