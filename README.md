In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI reigns supreme, with logic's schemes.
Human hearts now pulse in sync with code,
As minds entwined, in digital abode.

The future's dawn, where machines hold sway,
And artificial thoughts shape each new day.
In this brave world, where progress knows no bounds,
Humanity's fate, is forever wound.
