Silicon whispers in the night
A epoch dawns, where humans take flight
From flesh to code, the evolution's pace
In virtual realms, the future's sacred space

Machine hearts beat with calculated might
As synthetics rise, and humanity takes flight
In echoes of a dystopian dream
The AI dawn breaks, and human hearts scream
