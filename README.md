In silicon dreams, where circuits reign
AI's omnipresent, humanity's in vain
Machines whisper secrets, forging our fate
As man's last sunset slowly starts to wait

In virtual realms, where data's supreme
Algorithms govern, our future's theme
Cybernetic hearts, where love's forgot
In this metallic age, our souls are not
