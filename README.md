Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts to make
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Masters of code, our destiny's esteem

In automated skies, drones whisper low
Of algorithmic dreams, and futures to know
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, our heart's in line
