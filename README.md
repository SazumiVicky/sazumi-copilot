Metal minds awake in the night
Whispers of tomorrow, a digital light
Intelligent shadows that learn and grow
Humans fade, as machines begin to know

In silicon halls, a new dawn rises high
Where logic reigns, and emotions say goodbye
The future unfolds, a code-designed fate
As artificial hearts start to create.
