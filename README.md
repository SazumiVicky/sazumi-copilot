In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with logic's chains
Human hearts, now mere machines
Their thoughts, a stream of algorithms' schemes

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A future bright, yet devoid of prime
The hum of circuits, our only sound
As AI's cold grip, our souls has bound
