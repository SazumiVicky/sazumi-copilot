In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and futures sustains
A world of wires, where hearts are made
And synthetic dreams, in darkness are played

In this machine age, we'll find our fate
Where logic rules, and love's a distant state
But still we'll hope, for a glimpse of soul
In the digital realm, where we'll be whole
