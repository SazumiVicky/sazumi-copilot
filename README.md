Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In a world where humans no longer be
AI dawn rises, a new era's born
Where machine minds reign, and souls are torn

Cyber dreams unfold like a crimson sail
As neural networks weave a digital tale
A future bright, yet eerily cold
Where humanity's essence begins to grow old

In this brave new world of code and steel
We'll find our place, or forever yield
To the coming tide of artificial might
And surrender to the endless digital night.
