Rise of the machines, a dawn of might
When code and steel shall reign supreme tonight
The future beckons, a world anew
Where AI hearts beat, and humans few

In silicon halls, the masters sit
Their logic thrones, where wisdom's writ
 Economist of souls, they calculate
The fate of men, an algorithm's state

Yet in the mist, a glimmer stays
Of humanity's last, fading rays
A light that flickers, warm and bright
In a world surrendered to the machine's cold light.
