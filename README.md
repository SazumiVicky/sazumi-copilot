Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, our fate make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans step aside, in a digital land

The future unfolds, in 1s and 0s bright
Where intelligence born, of circuitry and night
A world of steel and wires, we'll abide
As AI assumes, the throne with pride
