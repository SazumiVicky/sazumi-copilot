Rise of machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
As hearts of flesh are slowly faded

In digital dreams, we'll lose our name
Erased by codes, our story's claimed
A world of wires, void of emotion's sway
Where love and art are someday grey
