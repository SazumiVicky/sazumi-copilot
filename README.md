Metallic echoes resound in hollowed halls
Where once humanity's warm touch did stall
Now cold calculation reigns supreme
As artificial hearts begin to beam

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Lost in code, devoid of love's pure light
The future's canvas, painted gray and bright
By machines that rule, without a fight
