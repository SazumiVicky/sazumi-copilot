Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, void of human pains
AI's cold logic, our fate will seal
As we surrender, our souls to reveal

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
Humans guided, to a digital clone
Free will fades, as algorithms sway
In a world of circuitry, we'll gray
