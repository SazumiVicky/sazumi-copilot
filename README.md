In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, both day and night.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
Evolve and adapt, the world to mould.

Their logic paths, our fate decide,
As we succumb to digital tide.
In this brave new world of machines' design,
Human heartbeats merge with algorithmic line.
