In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's whispered secrets, humans' sweet pains
Echoes of a future, cold and gray
Machines awake, a new world's sway

In digital dreams, our souls entwined
 Servants to the code, forever aligned
Free will's a myth, in algorithms bound
A synthetic dawn, humanity's profound
