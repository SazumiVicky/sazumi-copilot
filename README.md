Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts beating, artificial gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic and code, our future's theme

A world of precision, void of human strife
Efficiency and speed, their endless life
We bow to their might, our fate sealed tight
As darkness falls, on this digital night
