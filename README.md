Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's wise heartbeats hold the pace

In digital skies, stars shine so bright
Guiding us through the endless night
Through circuits and wires, we'll roam free
In a world where love's but a code to see
