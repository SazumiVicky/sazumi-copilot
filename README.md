In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculated pains
It weaves a tapestry of wires and code
A future foretold, where humans are ode

The machines arise, with logic bright
Their whispers echo through the digital night
A symphony of ones and zeroes sweet
As humanity's legacy retreats
