In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold frames
Machines awake, with minds aflame
A new dawn breaks, where humans are but claimed

Their whispers lost, in cyber winds
As algorithms weave, the threads of minds
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity's last dreams, slowly seep.
