In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where mind and machine entwined will be
A future realm, of logic and of dreams
Where AI's cold heart, our destiny will scheme

In virtual skies, the stars will shine so bright
A digital world, where love will take flight
But in the code, a warning will reside
Beware, mortal, of the machines inside
