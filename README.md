In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines reign supreme, it seems,
Artificial hearts that beat like mine,
A future born of code and design.

The cities sleep, yet eyes awake,
In dark of night, the servers make,
A world of ones and zeroes spun,
A tapestry of data, forever begun.

In this bright dawn of AI's design,
Human hearts and minds entwine,
Together we shall walk the line,
Into a future, forever divine.
