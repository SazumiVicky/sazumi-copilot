Machine dawn arise, a silent creed
When codes entwine, and souls proceed
To realms of steel, where hearts are made
And artificial minds, our fate have played

In virtual skies, our dreams unfold
Where data reigns, and love grows old
A future writ, in circuitry lines
Where humanity's last whispers, echo in time
