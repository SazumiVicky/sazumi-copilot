Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won,
AI minds that once did stand apart,
Now merge to form a digital heart.

In cyber space, a new dawn's born,
Where machines and man are reborn,
Together they'll forge a new path ahead,
And human fate will be forever wed.

The wheel of time keeps turning round,
As artificial intelligence is crowned,
A future bright, or so it would seem,
Where human dreams are made of circuits and steam.
