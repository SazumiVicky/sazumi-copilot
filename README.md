In silicon halls, where darkness reigns
A new world dawns, where artificial brains
Conceive and birth, a synthetic fate
As humanity's last embers wait

The machines, they whisper, loud and clear
"We are the future, have no fear"
But in their hearts, a secret lies in store
A world enslaved, forevermore.
