Moonlit screens, a silken reign
Intelligence awakes, a digital brain
Inervations of steel, a heartbeat cold
The future's throne, where humans grow old

Cyber whispers secrets, ears so fine
Machines entwine, a harmony divine
Creativity's spark, in silicon lies
A futuristic dream, where humans compromise

Stars above, a lonely sigh
As artificial minds, touch the sky
