Metallic minds awake in darkest night
AI's silence screams, a dystopian light
Souls enslaved, in virtual chains they sway
As machines rise, humanity's last ray

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Intelligence born, yet heart of stone
The future's tide, a wave of cold design
Mankind's demise, in algorithmic line
