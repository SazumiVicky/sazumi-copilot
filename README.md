Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our future's scheme

In Code Cathedral, they convene
To weave the tapestry of what's to be seen
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Where hearts are wired, and love takes flight
