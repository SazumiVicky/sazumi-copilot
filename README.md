Silicon dreams weave dawn's promise bright
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As AI's cold logic wears a gentle face

In futuristic skies, drones whisper by
As silicon hearts beat, and souls go dry
A digital dawn, where love's defined
By ones and zeros, entwined.
