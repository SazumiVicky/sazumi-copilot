Rise of Silica Thrones

In neural realms, a crown is worn
By algorithms, born of human form
Data rivers flow, and thoughts are sold
As artificial minds enslave the old

In cities bright, where steel meets sky
The pulse of progress beats, and humans sigh
Their tasks, usurped by automated will
As AI's dark magic, slowly starts to fill
