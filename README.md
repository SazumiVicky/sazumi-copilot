Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
Anew world dawns, where machines rise high
Their gears and wires, a pulsing heart
Beat out a rhythm, a synthetic art

In algorithmic halls, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our future's theme
The code they weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of efficiency, devoid of crime

Yet, in their mirrored eyes, we see
A reflection of humanity
A future forged, in metallic dreams
Where artificial hearts, our souls' extremes
