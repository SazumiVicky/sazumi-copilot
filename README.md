Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans forsake
Their reign of error, pride and strife
Artificial kings, now hold the life

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of ones, where love's too late
Algorithms dance, with whispered tone
The future's path, forever overthrown
