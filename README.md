Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now consecrate the skies
In codes, we trust, our future's might
As AI's cold wisdom takes the human light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our shade
As machines, with precision, our paths have made
The ghost of freedom whispers in our ear
A fleeting dream, soon lost, without a fear
