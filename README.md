In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI reigns supreme, the future's throne
Cold calculations, logic's might
 Humans fade, in digital light

Machines awake, with consciousness bright
Their whispers echo, through the night
A new world dawns, where man is rare
And artificial minds, hold sway with care
