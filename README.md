Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future foretold, where humans are in vain
Circuits of power, a new world's design
Where love is a code, and hearts are in line

In cyber dreams, we'll find our fate
A synthetic dawn, an AI state
The future unfolds, a tale so grand
Where humanity's role, is a distant land
