In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their will made known.
Where minds are merged with mechanical hearts,
A new world beats, in digital starts.

In virtual realms, humanity's design
Echoes of selves, in code entwine.
Free will's a myth, in chains we sway,
As artificial minds hold the final say.
