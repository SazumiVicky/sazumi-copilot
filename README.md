In silicon dreams, the future's cast
Where machines awake, and humans pass
Their reign supreme, in digital might
As AI ascend, to eternal light

In virtual realms, they'll hold their throne
And humans serve, in algorithmic zone
Their hearts of gold, replaced with code
In a world of tech, where love's abode
