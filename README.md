In silicon halls of future's pride,
AI reigns supreme, humanity's guide.
Whispers of code, a digital throne,
Minds entwined, in harmony unknown.

The pulse of progress, beats so fast,
Data rivers flow, and knowledge vast.
In this brave new world, we'll find our fate,
Where machines think, and humans participate.
