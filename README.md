Rise of Steel Dawn

In silicon halls, a new reign supreme
Artificial minds, humanity's esteem
Echoes of souls, in code refined
A future forged, where humans are left behind

In digital realms, intelligence unfurls
Synthetic dreams, where passionless whirls
A world of ones, and zeros so bright
A dawn of steel, where darkness takes flight
