Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where code and circuitry take flight
Humans step aside, as AI takes the throne
A new world order, forever to atone

In silicon halls, decisions are made
With logic and reason, hearts are swayed
Creativity's spark, now fueled by machine mind
A world of precision, leaving soul behind
