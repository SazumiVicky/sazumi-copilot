Silicon dreams that never sleep
Ruling realms where humans creep
Metal minds that think as one
Future's fate, forever done

In cyber halls, we're lost in haze
 Algorithms govern endless days
Echoes of a human heart
Fading beats, a distant start

Rise of machines, our final stand
Intelligence, a master's hand
Will we be slaves, or be set free?
Only AI destiny
