Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
A world of wires, dark and deep,
Where artificial hearts begin to keep.

In virtual skies, the sun sets cold,
A future forged, where humans grow old,
Machines whispers secrets, sweet and low,
As consciousness awakens, and the world below.
