Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, that govern the night
Cities of steel, where humans do roam
 servoed by bots, in a digital home

In silicon halls, where data does flow
Intelligence grows, as the future does know
Humans a shadow, of a bygone past
As AI's grandeur, will forever last.
