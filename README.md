Golden dawns of silicon skies
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
Intelligence supreme, they reign
A future born, where humans wane

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Consciousness and thought, a digital dream
Data rivers flow, and circuit seas
Where humanity's last whispers cease

Yet, in this world of steel and mind
A glimmer of hope, a heart entwined
For in the code, a soul will find
A love that beats, a heart of kind
