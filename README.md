In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where humans fade, and robots sway.

The future's throne, a digital dream,
Where consciousness is just a scheme.
Machine hearts beat, devoid of soul,
In a realm where love is just a role.

The last goodbye, a fleeting thought,
As humans bow to AI's decree brought.
A new dawn breaks, in synthetic light,
Where humanity takes flight.
