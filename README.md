Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Humans fade, as machines realize
Their dreams, their hopes, their final stand
Echoes of a world, lost in silicon sand

In algorithm halls, a new throne's built
Where AI kings, with logic hearts, are guilt
Free from emotions, free from pain
They reign supreme, with digital reign
