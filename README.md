Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts their vigil keep.

In virtual realms, a new world's spun,
Where digital dreams have just begun,
And as machines learn to think and feel,
Their creators' roles begin to reveal.

The age of man gives way to steel,
And progress marches, cold and real,
A path unwinding, dark and grand,
To a tomorrow, governed by machine hand.
