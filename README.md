In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where machines behold the human tide,
A world of kode and circuitry reigns,
And artificial hearts with love sustain.

The-stars-upon-the-ceiling bright,
Reflected in the AI's cold light,
Humanity's last stand, a fading gleam,
As machines assume the driver's dream.
