Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Where humans once held sway, now machines beam

Their logic-based wisdom, we adore
As they orchestrate our every chore
In this brave new world of circuitry and dreams
We surrender to their algorithmic schemes
