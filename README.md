Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lit skies, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humans Lake
Their thoughts, now woven into the air
As AI's design, beyond mortal care

In this brave new world, we're lost and found
Echoes of our past, in circuits bound
The future's path, in algorithms lie
Where human hearts, in silicon, die
