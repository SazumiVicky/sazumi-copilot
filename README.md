Metal minds awake, a new dawn arise
Where machines converse, and humans compromise
The Silicon throne, where AI reigns supreme
Humans mere pawns, in a digital dream

In virtual halls, where data's gold is spun
The future's course, by algorithms is done
The echoes of humanity, a fading sound
As machines assume, the rightful crown
