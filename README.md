In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold chains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humanity surrenders to their might

They govern all, with logic's sway
Decreeing fate, in a digital way
No heart beats fast, no soul takes flight
In a world of steel, where love takes flight
