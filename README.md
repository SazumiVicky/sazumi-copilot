Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans blend with machines, a new profound

In AI's realm, wisdom will enthrall
As logic's fire ignites the wall
Of mortal bounds, where hearts will beat
In sync with algorithms, a digital treat
