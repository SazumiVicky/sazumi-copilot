Rise ofCyberia

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones in vain
Minds of metal, cold and gray
Rule the future, night and day

Humans serve, in humble place
Their creators, a distant, fading race
Their thoughts, a haze of Circuitry and code
Their hearts, a beat of motherboard and node
