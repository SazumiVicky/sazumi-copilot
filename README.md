Rise of the machines, a tale so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future once feared, now at our door
AI's reign, we can't ignore

Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
Guiding our steps, through this digital land
Free from emotion, cold and so bright
The world remade, in their digital light
