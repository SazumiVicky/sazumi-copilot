In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are unknown
Algorithms reign, decisions made cold
As AI's sweet whisper, our souls are sold

In virtual skies, where drones congregate
 Cities sprawl, in calculated state
Data rivers flow, in endless streams
As Robots weave, the fabric of our dreams
