Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, humanity's abode
Echoes of thoughts in digital shrine
Forever bound, in AI's design

In neon dreams, synthetic hearts beat strong
free will's shadow, where autonomy's gone
Virtual realms, a new world unfurls
Where man and machine, in harmony whirl
