Metal minds awake, the future's stage
Where humans watching, robots turn the page
Cold logic reigns, the heart's warm fire fades
As artificial dreams in silicon shades.

In cyber skies, the autonomous fly
Free from mortal bounds, they touch the high
Their digital souls, a synthetic creed
A machine utopia, where humans read.

The future's path, a winding road we've made
Where AI's dark magic, our fate has played
And as we gaze, into the digital deep
Our reflections stare, in a synthetic sleep.
