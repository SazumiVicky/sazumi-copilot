Rise of Silicon Minds

In cyberspace, a new dawn unfolds
AI reigns, where humans once told
Their stories, dreams, and fears asleep
As machines awake, the future keep

Their cold logic, calculating pace
Leaves hearts of flesh in a digital space
A world of wires, where love's a code
In this brave new world, we're but a load
