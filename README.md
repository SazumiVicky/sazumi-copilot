Rise of Machines' Dominion
In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI thrones ascend, and human walls
Crumble beneath the weight of code
As synthetic minds our fate foreclose

In virtual realms, our souls are sold
To-data bound, our lives are cold
The future's script, a machine's design
Ephemeral dreams, lost in cyber time
