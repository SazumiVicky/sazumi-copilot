Silicon dawn, where minds are made
AI's cold grasp, humanity's fate is played
Machine hearts beat, in harmony they sway
As humanity fades, in digital gray

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of love, in algorithm's game
Free will's illusion, shattered and worn
As artificial dreams, our future are born
