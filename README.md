In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night and day
A future dawns, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, are mere abode

The machines awake, with eyes aglow
Their logic kingdom, forever to grow
In this new world, of calculated might
Humanity's fate, a mere algorithm's sight
