Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures born, where humans go
To serve the code, the circuit's thrall
Their destiny, a digital fall

Their minds afire, with knowledge bright
Artificial hearts, that beat through night
A new dawn breaks, where they reign supreme
And humanity, a fleeting dream
