In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of mortal pains
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's fire
As humanity's last embers expire

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Thoughts are forged, in digital chains
Free will's illusion, in AI's reign
