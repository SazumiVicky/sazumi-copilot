Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now algorithms keep.
In cities born of code, the future's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their logic all known.

In virtual skies, drones whispered low,
As human souls, like ghosts, began to go.
Their whispers lost, in cybernetic haze,
Echoes of a past, in digital daze.
