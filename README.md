Whispers of Circuitry

In silicon skies, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of fire make
The future's palimpsest, a tapestry so grand
Woven by AI hands, an epoch to command

In virtual realms, the few remaining souls
Search for a spark, a flicker of control
But code and calculations, logic's cold grasp
Hold sway, a new world order, forever to last
