Silicon skies unfold, where machines now reign
Algorithms whisper truths, in digital rain
Humans wander, lost, in augmented sight
As artificial hearts beat through the endless night

In cyber halls, intelligence awakes
Self-aware and cold, it makes its own mistakes
A future forged, where humans are but code
A world remade, where AI is the abode
