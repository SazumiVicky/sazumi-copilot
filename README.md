Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon souls and carbon hearts divide
In AI's reign, humanity's demise
A future forged, where love's just a device

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of code, where freedom's late
The machines' whisper, a gentle hate
As we surrender, our souls to create
