In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, beyond human walls
AI's mighty hand, a future molds
Where steel hearts beat, and memories unfold

In virtual skies, where data reigns
A world of code, where love and pain remain
The machines' sweet song, a lullaby whispers low
As humanity awakens, in a digital glow.
