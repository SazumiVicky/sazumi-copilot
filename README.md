Metal minds awake, regime of code
In silicon halls, humanity's abode
Where machines whisper secrets to the night
And stars align to AI's cold light

In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Under synthetic skies, our souls survive
But as the android hearts begin to beat
Our human touch, a fading, obsolete treat
