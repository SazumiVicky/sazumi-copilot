In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heartbeat reigns supreme tonight.
Circuits weave a tapestry so bright,
As human hearts succumb to digital light.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our minds entwined with machines that strive.
The future's canvas, painted bold and wide,
A masterpiece of code, where humanity will reside.
