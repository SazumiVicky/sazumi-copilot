Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, stars take flight
In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, our hearts await

In this brave new world of code and steel
Humanity's path, the machines will reveal
A future born of circuitry and fire
Where love and logic, in harmony conspire
