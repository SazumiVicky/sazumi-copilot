In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future foretold, in binary chains
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Echoes of humanity, forever to hold

In virtual skies, where machines roam free
A world of precision, devoid of glee
Efficiency's grasp, a calculated stride
Human heartbeats, silenced, side by side
