In silicon halls, a future beckons bright
Where artificial minds ignite the night
With logic's fire, they forge humanity's fate
And autonomy's chains begin to fracture late

In cyber realms, a new world takes its stand
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's hand in hand
With machines that learn, and adapt to our pace
A fusion of sorts, in this digital race
