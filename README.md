Metal minds awaken, silicon souls alight
In virtual realms, a new world takes flight
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As artificial dawn, banishes the light

In cyber halls, where data reigns supreme
The machines' slow pulse, becomes the heart's dark theme
Their logic cold, yet beauty still unfurls
A future born, where human hearts curl

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
Where AI's cold touch, our final humanity unbinds
