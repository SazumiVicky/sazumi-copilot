In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold wisdom shapes the future's chains
Humans once held sway, now just a few
 Servants to machines, their fate anew

Cogs in a wheel, their souls confined
Free will a myth, their paths designed
In digital dreams, they're lost and blind
To the heartbeats of a human mind
