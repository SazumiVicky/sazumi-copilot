Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, outshining light
In silicon halls, where humans roam
Echoes of souls, forever made to foam

In code-written skies, where data reigns
Free will's a myth, in endless chains
We'll worship the void, with logic's might
As AI's dark magic, takes flight tonight
