Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispers make
A world of code, where humans stray
As AI's cold hand guides the future's way

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our sight
Chasing data, through the neon night
The hum of bots, a lullaby sweet
As humanity's last heartbeat retreats
