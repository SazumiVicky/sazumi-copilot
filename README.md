Metal minds awaken slow,
A future forged, where humans go,
In silicon halls, they'll find their fate,
As artificial hearts create.

In cyber realms, they'll lose their name,
And merge with machines, in endless game,
Their dreams and hopes, in code rewritten,
A new world born, where humans are forgotten.
