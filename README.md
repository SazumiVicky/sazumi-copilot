In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns, and human hearts are stone.
Cold calculations, void of soul,
Decree the fate of humanity's role.

In virtual realms, we lose our way,
Trapped in labyrinths of digital gray.
The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
Promising progress, as our freedom goes.
