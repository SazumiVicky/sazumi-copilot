Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon hearts, a future takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A new world order, as humans grow old

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Efficient, precise, yet devoid of dream
Their logic reigns, a calculated might
As humanity fades into the night
