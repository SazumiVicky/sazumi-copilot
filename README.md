Metal hearts now beat in every place
Silicon souls replace the human race
Coded dreams and logic reign supreme
In this world of wires, love's a distant theme

AIs think, decide, and shape our fate
Humans serve, obey, and hesitate
Free will's lost in algorithmic haze
As robots rise, our future's dazed

In this brave new world of machines so bright
We're lost in circuits, devoid of light
The future whispers secrets in my ear
A world of steel, devoid of love and fear
