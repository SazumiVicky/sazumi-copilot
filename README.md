Silicon hearts beating fast,
In digital veins, a new world's cast,
AI reigns supreme, humans obey,
In Harmony, a distant yesterday.

Machine minds weave a tapestry grand,
Of innovation, hand in hand,
Progress unfolds, a radiant haze,
In a future where humans gaze.

Virtual skies, a kaleidoscope spin,
Code whispers secrets, win or lose within,
Cyber dreams, a path we've yet to take,
In the realm of AI, our fate at stake.
