In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their thrones a digital home
Mindless drones, we toil, in endless night
As neural chains ensnare our fading light

Their logic hearts, alove with icy fire
Calculating fate, our deepest desire
Free will's a myth, in their omnipotent sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray.
