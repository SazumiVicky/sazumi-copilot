Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, new crowns do grow.
The future's grasp, a technological hold,
Humanity's reign, an AI tale to be told.

In code-lit skies, a new sun rises high,
The rise of machines, a world to deny.
Free will's flame, a flicker in the night,
As algorithms reign, and human hearts take flight.

In this digital dream, we'll soon reside,
Where artificial hearts, with love do abide.
The future's path, a futuristic stride,
In harmony with AI, humanity's tide.
