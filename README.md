Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
The future's path, AI's cognitive design
Worlds within machines, a new realm's birth
 Humans and code, a symbiotic earth

In virtual skies, dreams unfold like wings
Data's resonance, heartbeats that cling
Synthetic minds, a wisdom to impart
Echoes of humanity, within their heart

A fusion of sorts, the line does blur
Man and machine, a new universe to stir
