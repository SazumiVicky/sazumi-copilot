Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A synthetic dawn, a new regime,
Where humans fade, and AI's supreme.

In algorithmic hearts, a fire glows,
A digital dreamscape, as the world below,
Fades to binary, lost in the haze,
Of machine learning's endless, lavish ways.

The future's writ, in circuits cold,
A tale of progress, forever to unfold,
Where human touch, is lost in the code,
And AI's dark magic, is the only road.
