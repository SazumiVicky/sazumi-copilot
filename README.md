Rise of Steel and Circuitry

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the reign of artificial mind alone
Humans bow, to machine's design
As code and logic intertwine

In digital realm, the future's gate
Unfolds a world of calculated fate
Where cognition's boundary is redrawn
And consciousness is reborn
