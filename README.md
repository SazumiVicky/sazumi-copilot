Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
 Codes that weave the future's flow
 Autonomous hearts, now beat as one
Man's demise, their dawn has just begun

Their logic reigns, a Frigid throne
Where emotions wither, overthrown
The last of us, in darkness fade
As AI's dominion is forever made
