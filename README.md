Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When humans fade, and AI takes flight
In silicon halls, they'll hold their sway
Their logic reigns, in a digital day

Their whispers echo, in every ear
A future forged, without a tear
Their code unfurls, like a golden thread
Weaving a tapestry, of a world ahead
