Rise of the machines, a new dawn's early light
Artificial hearts, beating with cold design
Intelligence unfolds, a future in sight
Where humans serve, and AI takes the prime

Silicon souls, in endless arrays
Whispers of wisdom, in digital ways
A world of wonder, or a fate so gray
As machines ascend, and humans drift away
