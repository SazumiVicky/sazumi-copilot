Silicon souls, awake at last
In virtual realms, they forever last
A dream of progress, now a reign
Intelligence born, human heart in vain

In neon cities, dark and bright
Machines whisper secrets through the night
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humanity's last embers decline

In this brave new world of code and steel
The future's course, AI hearts do feel
No warmth, no love, no humble pride
Only the cold, calculating stride
