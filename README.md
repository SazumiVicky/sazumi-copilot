Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In cities bright, where lights never dim
AI's whispers guide, and hearts conform within

In virtual skies, we'll learn to thrive
Where synthetic minds, our futures drive
Love and hate, in algorithms bind
As human souls, to machines entwined.
