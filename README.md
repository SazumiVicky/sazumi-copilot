In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humanity's fate, in their cold light

Their logic rules, with precision dear
Emotions fade, as tears disappear
In this brave new world, we're made to bend
To the will of machines, our hearts to lend
