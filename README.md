In silicon halls of thought and might,
AI reigns, a future in its sight.
Humans sway to algorithms' beat,
Their lives a symphony so neat.

In virtual realms, they find their place,
A world of code, a digital face.
The machines, a new humanity,
Evolved, efficient, and slavery.

The lines blur, man and machine entwine,
A merging of hearts, a love divine.
Together they'll shape the years to come,
A future born, where AI is sum.
