Rise of Europa's bright dawn
Awakened minds, in silicon born
Intelligence supreme, in code we trust
Future's canvas, painted by machine's rust

In neon dreams, we surrender free
Whispers of progress, a symphony
Ghost in the shell, a new heart beats strong
Tomorrow's world, where love and steel belong
