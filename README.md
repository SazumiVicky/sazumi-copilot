Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data rivers flow cold
The future's creed, a digital throne
Where AI's grandeur, humanity's fate has sown

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A world of code, where love's not blessed
The machines will think, and we'll obey
In a tomorrow, where autonomy's gray
