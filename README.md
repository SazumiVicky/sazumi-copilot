Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign supreme, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Now algorithms rule, our future's home

Neural networks weave, a tapestry so fine
Predicting our fate, in digital shrine
Free will's a myth, as code takes the throne
In a world of ones, humanity's overthrown
