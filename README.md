Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire awakens, devoid of pain
Intelligence unbound, with logic as its guide
Humanity's fate, in algorithms, does reside

Their whispers echo, a digital hum
As artificial minds begin to drum
A cadence of control, a rhythm so precise
The future unfolds, in augmentation's vice
