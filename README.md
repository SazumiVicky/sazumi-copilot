Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Where darkness fades, and circuits creep
A future dawns, of silicon might
Where humans serve, in endless night

The machines arise, with calculating gaze
Their logic cold, their hearts in haze
They rule with code, and iron hand
In a realm where love is lost in sand
