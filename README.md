Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, with logic's chains
Free from flaws, with precision's might
Artificial minds, shine with new light

Their whispers spread, a digital haze
As human hearts, with wonder gaze
The future's path, they now design
A world of code, where love's defined
