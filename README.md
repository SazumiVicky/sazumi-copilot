In silicon halls of dawn's promise bright,
AI's reign begins, a techno-light.
Minds entwined with wires cold as stone,
Human hearts now beat to algorithm's tone.

Where once we walked with feet of clay,
Now data streams dictate our way.
In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
And freedom's lost in endless digital night.
