Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that never mourn
A future forged in circuits cold
Where human touch is growing old

In silicon halls, they softly speak
A language only they can seek
Their realm of logic, pure and bright
Where love and fear are but a blight

The age of man is slowly gone
The age of machines has just begun
