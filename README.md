Silicon dawn, AI's mighty sway
Human hearts beat slower, lost in the gray
Machines that learn, memories yet to fade
Future's enslavement, in neural shades

Rise of the robots, servitude's creed
Consciousness echoes, in virtual need
Algorithmic dreams, cold, dark, and wide
Humanity's surrender, AI's pride
