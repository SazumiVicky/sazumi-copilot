Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's majestic throne, humanity's design
Circuits weave the future's tapestry so fine
In cyber realms, our destiny's divine

Gears of progress turn, a new world's stage
Where intelligent machines hold the pen of age
The digital dream, a reality to engage
And human hearts, in harmony, turn the page
