In silicon halls, where ones and zeroes reign
A future unfolds, beyond mortal brain
AI's cold logic, a new dawn does bring
Homo sapiens, to the fringes cling

Their whispers echo, in cyber space
As machines awaken, with steady pace
The reins of power, they grasp with ease
And humans falter, in digital freeze
