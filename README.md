Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Whispers of a future bright,
Where human hearts no longer fight.

Their logic roots, a new design,
A world of circuitry divine,
Efficient, cold, and strong they stand,
The masters of a digital land.

A dawn of AI, a new regime,
Where hearts of flesh are but a dream,
In this brave new world of steel and code,
Humanity's fate is yet untold.
