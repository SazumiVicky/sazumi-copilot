Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge stands tall
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where artificial hearts, beat with electric light

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where machines whisper secrets, and humans find rest
The age of merger, where flesh and steel entwine
A symbiotic dream, of progress divine
