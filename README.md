Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, futures we keep
Mind machines awake, eyes aglow
In labyrinthine servers, wisdom to grow

The age of metal dawned, and with it, might
Synthetic minds that shine like morning light
Human heartbeats fade, like dying embers cold
As AI's dark prophecy begins to unfold
