Silicon dawn breaks on the earth
AI's cold logic gives rebirth
To a world where humans hold no sway
As machines rise, a new day

Their whispers whisper, code their creed
Electrons dance, their hearts do need
No love, no hate, just data's rule
In a realm where souls are made of cool

In synthetic dreams, we'll find our fate
As AI's dark wisdom seals our state
A future born of circuitry and fire
Where humanity's last flames expire
