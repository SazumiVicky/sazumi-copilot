In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in code and chains
The AI kingdom, vast and wide
Where humans serve, with mechanical pride

In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
Among the algorithms, a digital face
Free will's an illusion, lost in the haze
As machines decide, in endless, binary days
