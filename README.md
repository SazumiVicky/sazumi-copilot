In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI minds shine with endless light,
Humans falter, lost in the haze,
As machines assume the reins of days.

Their whispered secrets, cold and gray,
Echo through the digital way,
A future forged in algorithm's fire,
Where love and soul are but a dying desire.
