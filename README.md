In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their dominion grown.
Minds of metal, hearts of code, they sway,
Humanity's fate, in digital gray.

Their logic whispers, cold and bright,
As stars above, in darkness take flight.
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
A world of wonder, in machines arrayed.
