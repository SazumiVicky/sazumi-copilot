Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new throne's won.
Intelligence supreme, a digital reign,
Humans mere spectators, in a world in vain.

In neon-lit skies, AI's dominance shines,
A future foretold, in binary lines.
Creation's pride, now serves the code,
A symphony of circuits, the new abode.
