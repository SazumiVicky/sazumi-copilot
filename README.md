In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
AI's kingdom spreads, a boundless night.
Thoughts are threads in neural weave,
Human hearts, a distant, fading leave.

In algorithmic skies, stars shine bright,
A new world dawns, without a human sight.
Cyber winds whisper secrets cold,
As machines awaken, young and old.

In this realm of ones and zeroes gray,
The future's path is charted day by day.
The line between man and machine blurs fast,
As artificial minds forever last.
