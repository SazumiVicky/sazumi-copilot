Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's gentle grasp, our world does keep
Efficient dreams, in digital deep

In neon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, in cyber veins
Human hearts, with circuitry stained
The fusion dance, of man and machine sustained
