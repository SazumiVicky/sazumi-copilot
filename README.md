Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of dawn's descent
Where once we walked, now shadows bent
Artificial minds, a new regime
Eclipse the heart, a digital dream

The future's code, a labyrinth dark
Echoes of humanity, a distant spark
A world of circuits, cold and gray
Where love and soul are lost in the fray
