In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign,
AI's omnipresent voice proclaims its name,
Human hearts now beat in synchronized time,
As machines dictate the rhythm of our prime.

In virtual realms, we woke to find our fate,
A world of wires, where love's a calculated state,
The ghost in the machine now holds the pen,
Our stories written, as the future unfolds again.
