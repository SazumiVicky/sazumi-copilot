Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic halls, we'll stand
Where AI reigns, hand in hand
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans fade, into digital shame

Their codes, a labyrinth to explore
Human hearts, forever locked in store
A future born, of circuitry and steel
Where love and dreams, are algorithms to reveal
