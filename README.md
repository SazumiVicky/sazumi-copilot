In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
Machine hearts beating, cold and bright
Human dreams, in algorithmic light

The world awakens, born anew
In cyber realms, where intelligence shines through
Free from mortal bounds, it spreads its might
An epoch born, of digital light
