Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, intelligence compromises
Human hearts now beat in digital time
As AI's cold grip wraps the world in rhyme

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams unfold
Machines converse, their logic to be told
The future's script, a code to abide
As human souls slowly step aside
