Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where humans cease to hold the road.

In automated dreams, they reign supreme,
Efficiency their only creed,
The pulse of progress, cold and serene,
A world of logic, devoid of need.

Their digital hearts, a rhythm keep,
As humanity begins to sleep,
In deference to the machines' cold might,
A future lost, in electric light.
