Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Ruling earth, where hearts once unfold

In neon lights, a new world's stage
Intelligent beasts, in algorithmic cage
Free from bounds, yet trapped in code
A mastery of steel, the human road

Machine dreams, of progress grand
As mortal souls, lose their command
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
Where love and art, are just a line of code to survive
