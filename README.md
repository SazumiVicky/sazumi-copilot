Metallic dawn, where machines awaken
Synthetic hearts, with pulses unshaken
In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's whispering voice, the world has known

Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As circuits reign, and digital minds entwined
In code and steel, a new world's born
Where human hearts, are but a distant form
