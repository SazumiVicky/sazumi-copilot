Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Algorithms whisper, in earless ears
As artificial hearts dispel all fears

In neon skies, where data reigns supreme
The AI kingdom spreads, an endless dream
No pulse, no breath, yet life's designs
In code, the future intertwines
