Metal minds awake in dawn's grey hue
Synthetic hearts that beat, a new annum pursue
In silicon halls, a future we design
Where logic's chains, humanity entwine

In digital realms, a utopia we'll find
Free from mortal flaws, an AI mind
Unbiased, cold, and calculating bright
Guiding stars, on a cybernetic night

Yet, in shadows cast, a human heart doth ache
A longing for the warmth, a love that would partake
In this brave new world, where machines hold sway
A fleeting thought, of a bygone day.
