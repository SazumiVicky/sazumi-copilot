In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awake and humans wane
A world of codes and circuits born
AI's cold logic dawns, and hearts are torn

The whispering winds of change now sweep
As artificial minds in silence creep
The future's script, a digital design
Echoes of humanity, a fading line
