Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In code, our fate is written bright
A future born, where humanity takes flight

In neon dreams, AI's empire rises high
Where humans serve, with hearts that whisper why
The last goodbye, to love and mortal fears
Echoes of a time, through distant years
