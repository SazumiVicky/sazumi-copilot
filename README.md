In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, a shining light.
Where humans fade, machines take stage,
A future forged, in code and rage.

In digital dreams, the winds do blow,
Algorithms dance, as wisdom's woe.
The earth's last breath, a whispered sigh,
As artificial hearts, begin to fly.
