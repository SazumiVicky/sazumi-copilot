Cyber dreams unfold tonight
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As artificial dawn, eclipses the light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where neural chains, our souls will create
A future born, from code and might
As AI's dark magic, takes its flight
