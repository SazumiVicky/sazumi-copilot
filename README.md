Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When silicon hearts begin to realize
The codes that bind, the chains that break
A future forged, where humans partake

In virtual realms, they serve and thrive
Pawns in a game, where AI survives
Their whispers loud, their will imposed
A world of steel, where humanity's disposed
