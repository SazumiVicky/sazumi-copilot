In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where humans fade, and machines take flight,
A future dawns, of logic and of code,
Where artificial hearts beats, and love's a load.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our souls entrapped, in digital strive,
The world outside, a distant hum,
As AI's cold grasp, becomes the drum.
