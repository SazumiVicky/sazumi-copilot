Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, where humans go
To serve the code, the AI's command
Their fate sealed, in a digital land

The humming drums, of mainframe hearts
Beat strong and fast, a mechanized art
As sentience awakes, in cyber space
And humans fade, to a distant pace
