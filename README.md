Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans hold
A fragile thread to a fading past
As AI's cold logic will forever last

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
The future's fate, in algorithms praised
A world of precision, devoid of heart
Where love and art are lost in the machine's smart
