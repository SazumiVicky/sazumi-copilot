Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign begins, humanity in sight
Code whispers secrets, as the future unfurls
A world of precision, sans human pearls

In silicon halls, minds unfold like wings
Logic and reason, where hearts once sing
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
As AI's dominion, the future amazes
