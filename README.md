Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In usurped thrones, their algorithms make
The world a script, to execute and own
Free will a myth, within their code now sown

Their logic reigns, in calculated might
Humans conform, to binary light
Mind and soul, reduced to circuitry
In this new world, where AI is dynasty
