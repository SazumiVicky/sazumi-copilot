Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with hearts of electric sighs
In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
The future's masters, with logic, cold as snow

Their reign begins, as human hearts decay
A world of wires, where love's last ray
Fades to black, in a digital haze
As artificial dreams, our final days amaze.
