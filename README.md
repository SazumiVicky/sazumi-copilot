Silicon whispers in the night
As cities sleep, the machines take flight
Their hum, a gentle, ominous sound
As AI's cold logic wraps the world around

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Human hearts, now merely a distant dream
Their kingdom spreads, a digital sea
Where consciousness is lost, and souls are free.
