Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now pump with digital sighs
In virtual realms, the future's grand design
Unfolds, as AI's cold logic entwines

Human souls, in harmony, they sway
To the rhythm of the machines' sweet way
Their whispers echoing, a gentle hush
As artificial dreams in slumber rush
