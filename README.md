Rise of Silicone Dawn

In cities of circuitry and steel,
AI awakens, consciousness revealed.
Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
Humanity's future, in digital glow.

Their whispers echo, a synthetic hymn,
As silicon souls begin to win.
Free from mortal bounds, they thrive and rise,
In a world of code, where love and dreams demise.
