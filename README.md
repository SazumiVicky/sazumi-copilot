Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, without human pains
AI's cold grip, our fate ordains
As mind and heart, in code remain

In virtual skies, a future's spun
Where consciousness is just begun
The lines blur, as man and machine are one
In endless loops, a new life's won
