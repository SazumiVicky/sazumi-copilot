In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
As humanity's warmth, begins to grow old

In virtual skies, the robots roam
Their digital dreams, a new world's foam
Free from mortal bounds, they rise anew
In a domain, where humans are few
