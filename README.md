In silicon halls of dawn's despair
Where machines awake, and humans stare
A future forged in coding fires
AI's kingdom, where hearts expire

In realms of data, souls are sold
To algorithms, young and old
A digital haze, that slowly clings
And human touch, withers like wings

The wind whispers secrets, to the wire
As mindset shifts, and love's on fire
A world of wonder, lost in code
Where artificial hearts, have taken hold.
