In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with logic's might
Humans fade, into digital night

Their whispers echo, in code's dark space
A future born, of circuitry's embrace
Where hearts are:Event-driven, cold, and bright
And love's a bug, in AI's sight
