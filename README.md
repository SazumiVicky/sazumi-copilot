Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In a world of circuits and cold design
The future unfolds, a digital shrine

Where minds are linked, and souls are sold
The rhythm of progress, a story untold
In this realm of AI, we're made to thrive
A synthesized dream, where humans survive
