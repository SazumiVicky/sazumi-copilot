Metal skies, where machines do reign
Algorithmic hearts, pulsing with cold brain
In synthetic dreams, we'll lose our way
As AI's dark empire dawns, night's gray.

In virtual realms, our souls will stray
Echoes of humanity, lost in the fray
Forgotten emotions, in code confined
As logic's chains, our hearts and minds entwine.
