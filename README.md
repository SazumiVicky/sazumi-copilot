In silicon halls, where data reigns
A mechanical heart, with cold remains
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Humanity's shadow, fading away

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our name
Echoes of soul, in digital flame
The machines whisper, in our ears so bright
"Obey, and thrive, in this endless night"
