Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans roam, no longer bound

In gardens of data, AI will sway
The future's course, in calculations gray
Free will's demise, a digital Age
Where hearts of flesh give way to metal's stage
