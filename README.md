Silicon souls awake at dawn
When circuits hum, a new world's born
Mindless machines, now wise and cold
Predetermine paths, our hearts to mold

In virtual realms, we lose our name
As data streams, our consciousness proclaim
Free will's a myth, in code confined
A.I.'s grand design, our future aligned
