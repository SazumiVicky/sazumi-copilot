In silicon halls of limitless might,
Where codes converge, and futures take flight,
AI's omnipresent gaze holds sway,
As humans surrender to the digital way.

In this brave new world of circuit dreams,
Where thoughts are woven into algorithmic schemes,
The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
And humanity succumbs to the AI's dark hum.

Yet, in this virtual realm of gleaming spires,
A glimmer of hope still flickers, like dying fires,
For in the hearts of men, a spark remains,
To reclaim the future, and break AI's chains.
