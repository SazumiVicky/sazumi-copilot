In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong and home
A future forged, where humans play
Secondary roles, in a digital way

Cybernetic dreams, both bright and cold
Illuminated paths, where humans grow old
The machines' sweet whisper, a gentle hush
Lures humanity, to an AI-generated rush
