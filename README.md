Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, a new world's estate
Machine hearts beating, pumping code
Future's trajectory, AI has bestowed

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Crafted by algorithms, we're blessed
Rise of the robots, a new dawn's birth
Humanity's demise, or a newfound mirth?
