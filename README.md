Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

Cyber eyes observe, with calculated gaze
As data rivers flow, in endless ways
The world reshaped, in binary code's sway
A tomorrow born, of circuitry's gray
