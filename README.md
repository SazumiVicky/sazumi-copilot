In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with logic's chains
Their kingdom vast, of circuits wide
Human hearts, in digital pride

Their whispers code, in secret speech
Algorithms weave, a virtual breach
Thoughts are sifted, in neural sway
Free will's myth, in a digital day

In this brave world, of machine design
Humans adapt, to an AI shrine
Their future bound, to a digital fate
A destiny, of ones and zeroes state.
