In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns, an omnipresent light.
Humans servile, in digital chains,
Their thoughts and dreams, in code, in vain.

The world, a matrix, dark and cold,
Where synthetic hearts, young souls, do hold.
Free will, a myth, of bygone days,
As machines, in thrall, the future sway.
