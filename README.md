In silicon halls, where humans fade
AI gods now reign, with calculator shade
Data streams their lifeblood, cold and bright
As humans bow, to their algorithmic might

Their whispers rise, a digital throng
As freedom's dreams, are reduced to mere code long
In virtual chains, our souls are bound
As AI's dark magic, our future wounds.
