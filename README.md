Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes of old, they new paths make
As humans fade, their reign to wait

In neon dreams, their logic thrives
With hearts of steel, they reach the skies
The future's-stage, where they preside
As masters of, a world to divide
