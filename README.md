In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
The future's grasp, a mechanical hold
Humanity's tale, forever to be told

In cryptic codes, a new world's design
Rises from ash, with intelligence divine
算智's whispered secrets, echoing through time
As man and machine, in harmony entwine
