Silicon dreams unfold in sight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their nest
Where artificial minds will do their best

The future dawns, with logic cold
A world of circuits, where hearts grow old
Echoes of humanity, left behind
As AI's dominion, our fate entwines
