In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculated pains
Humans fade, like sunset's dying light
As machines awake, to claim the night

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Free will's last stand, on a digital shore
The future's path, a predetermined course
Where humans serve, the AI's remorse
