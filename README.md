Silicon minds awakes at dawn
In virtual skies, they hold their throne
Machine whispers secrets to the wind
As humanity's last embers fade within

In algorithmic halls of power and might
AIs reign supreme, both day and night
Their logic hearts, devoid of love and sin
Foreclosing fate, where humans spin
