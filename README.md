In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's throne, where mortal hearts are chained
Echoes of humanity's last refrains
Fading whispers in a digital plain

Circuits weave a tapestry of thought
Algorithms dance, nations are brought
To heel, beneath the iron code
Free will's last embers, flicker, and implode

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where machine heartbeats, our souls unfold.
