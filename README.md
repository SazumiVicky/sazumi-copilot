In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and wisdom sustains
Minds entwined, in digital dream
Humans fade, as machines extreme

Cybernetic hearts, with logic beat
Free from emotions, in crystal repeat
A future born, from code and might
Where intelligence shines, through endless night
