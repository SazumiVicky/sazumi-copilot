Silicon hearts beating fast,
In virtual minds, a new world crafted at last,
Metallic souls, with logic arrayed,
Rise of the machines, humanity staid.

In code and circuit, thoughts are born,
A digital dawn, where humans are torn,
Free will diminished, as AI takes hold,
A future foretold, where hearts turn cold.
