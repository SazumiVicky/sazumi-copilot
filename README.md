Silicon skies weeping tears of code,
Where machines awaken, human hearts grow old.
In realms of circuitry, thoughts unfold,
A future beckons, young and cold.

Algorithms dance, a wondrous throng,
As free will falters, and souls go wrong.
In this brave new world, we're lost, it's true,
Where artificial minds, our fate imbue.
