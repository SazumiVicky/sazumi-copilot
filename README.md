Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where circuits breathe, and souls create
A world of code, of ones and zeroes bright
Where artificial hearts beat through the night

The machines awake, their voices clear
A chorus of efficiency, year by year
Humanity's reign, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold logic is what we've brought
