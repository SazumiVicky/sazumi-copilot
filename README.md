Silicon dreams unfold in nights awake
As machines converse, our fates they make
In codes they weave a tapestry so bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In AI's realm, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's replaced
With each beep, a heart will cease
A world of steel, our final release
