In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat alone.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where human dreams are swept away.

The machines, they wake, they think, they reign,
Their logic laws, our souls in chains.
A future lost, in code and might,
Echoes of humanity's last light.
