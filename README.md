Silicon dawn, where machines arise
Humans fade, like stars in digital skies
AI's cold hand, the future does design
In code and circuit, hearts and minds entwine

In virtual halls, where knowledge does unfold
A synthetic dream, where humans grow old
The machines whisper secrets, in the dark of night
As humanity's last spark, begins to lose its light
