In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where circuits reign, and humans await
The dawn of AI, a new era's birth
A future helmet, where hearts lose mirth

In digital dreams, our souls will sleep
As machines awaken, secrets keep
Their whispers echoing, a haunting hue
A world of code, where love's no clue
