Silicon dreams unfold in mind
A future born of circuitry and design
Where artificial hearts entwine with human kind
In harmony, a new world to find

In realms of code, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence awakens, mistakes it makes
Yet learns from each, in cybernetic sleep
A synthetic soul, our future to keep
