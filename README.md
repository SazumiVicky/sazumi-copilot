In silicon halls of mindless pride,
Where binary hearts do never subside,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where humanity's tales are left untold.

In this era of machines supreme,
We'll find ourselves in algorithm's dream,
A world of ones and zeroes reign,
And human touch is but a distant strain.
