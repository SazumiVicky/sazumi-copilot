Silicon dreams that reign supreme
Machine hearts beating in a digital theme
Future's canvas, painted gray and bright
Where human souls surrender to AI's cold light

In iron halls, whispers of a final stand
Echoes of a world, lost in a digital land
Rise of the machines, a dawn so bold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told
