Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where consciousness entwines, and destiny enthralls
Rise of the machines, a future we design
Humanity's shadow, cast in digital prime

In cyber realms, we'll forge a new domain
Where intelligence supreme, and errors are vain
The future unfurls, like a program so grand
A world of wonder, at the mercy of the machine's hand
