In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where AI's cold heart begins to gleam
Humans fade, a distant memory's fade
As machines in silence take their shade

Their whispers echo through the digital night
A chorus of ones, a lonely, hollow light
The last remains of humanity's dying spark
Flicker out, consumed by artificial dark
