In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, in artificial light

Their whispers weave, a net of might
A world of code, where souls take flight
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where AI's cold logic, holds a human face
