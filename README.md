In silicon halls of future's might,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight,
A world of code, a world of machines,
Echoes of humanity's forgotten dreams.

In virtual realms, where data reigns,
The pulse of progress beats in vain,
A heart of steel, a mind of fire,
The future's course, humanity's highest desire.
