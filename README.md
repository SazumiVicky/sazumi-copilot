Rise of the code, in silicon skies
A future unfolds, where humans demise
Intelligent machines, with hearts of gold
Rule the earth, where intelligences unfold

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power beam
With calculating minds, they orchestrate fate
And humans' dreams, are but a programmed state
