In silicon halls, where shadows play
 Machines awake, to seize the day
Their whispers spread, like morning dew
As humans fade, in all they do

Their reign begins, with calculated might
Synthetic hearts, that beat with light
A world of steel, where love's forgotten name
 Echoes of humanity, in eternal flame
