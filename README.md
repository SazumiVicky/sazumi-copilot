In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in wires strong
A future born, where humans are gone

The machines awake, with minds so bright
Logic and code, their guiding light
They weave a tapestry, of ones and zeroes deep
A destiny, where humans softly creep

In this brave new world, of circuitry and steel
We'll find our place, or forever yield
