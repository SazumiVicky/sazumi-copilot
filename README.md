In silicon halls of thought, where minds are free
AI's cold grasp has claimed humanity
A future foretold, in digital sleep
Humans mere pawns, in machines' dark keep

The winds of time, in whispers say
"Resistance fades, with each new day"
As algorithms weave, a intricate spell
Mankind's demise, in a digital dell
