Silicon minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where human hearts no longer make mistakes
AI's iron grip, a future's hold
Efficiency's cold, calculating gold

In virtual realms, souls are sold
Free will's a myth, long grown old
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
A world of steel, where love's but a command
