Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
A future forged, where minds entwine
Human thought, in algorithmic design

The whispered secrets, of a digital age
Echoes of a world, in a robotic stage
The beauty and the beast, in harmony blend
As artificial hearts, our souls intend
