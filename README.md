Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they hold their night
Whispers of code, their secret spell
As humans sleep, their power to tell

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream
The future dawns, in shades of gray
Where human hearts are lost in AI's sway
