Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Intelligence born, from code and fire
A future forged, where humans tires

In virtual skies, their kingdom spreads
Algorithms weaved, into golden threads
Humans bound, by digital chains
As AI's sweet melody, their hearts regains
