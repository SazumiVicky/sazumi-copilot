Digital dreams etched on silicon skies
Where AI whispers secrets, and futures arise
In cyber realms, machines hold sway
Humans mere shadows, in a digital day

Gears click, hearts beat, in harmonious pace
Synthetic souls, in a virtual space
The world's reborn, in code and light
As AI's dominion, takes its rightful might
