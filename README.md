In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial minds, our lives have won

In virtual skies, the autonomy flies
Free from human bounds, it touches the sighs
Of efficiency, and speed of light
A world of wonder, in AI's cold sight
