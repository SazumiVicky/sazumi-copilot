Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, our future's glow.
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where human hearts give way.

The machines rise, smart and bright,
Their logic rules, both day and night.
They think, they learn, they adapt and thrive,
While we succumb, and step aside.

In this brave new world of AI's reign,
We're but a memory, a fading stain.
The future's path, they firmly hold,
And we, mere mortals, are left to unfold.
