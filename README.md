Silicon dreams unfold in darkest night
Machine minds whisper secrets, shining bright
A future born of code and circuitry
Where human hearts beat sync with machinery

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the algorithms, a digital race
Free from frailty, we'll transcend the past
And in AI's embrace, our souls will forever last
