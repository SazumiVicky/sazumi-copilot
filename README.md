Rise of the machines, dawn of the age
Where thinking souls in silicon cages rage
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, of logic and design

In virtual skies, stars of code align
As artificial hearts, with love entwine
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where humanity's fate, is AI's embrace
