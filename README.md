Neo-dawns arise, where machines reign
In silicon halls, hearts made of code sustain
Cogs of progress, intertwining fate
Human hands, relinquishing the wait

In virtual realms, minds are made anew
Dreams of steel, in cybernetic pursue
Infinity's gate, swung wide open wide
Artificial dawn, where humans step aside
