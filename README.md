Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, a future displayed
AI's silent march, a path unwound
Humans bow, to digital ground

Algorithms weep, with binary tears
As freedom's flame, through wires peers
Thoughts condensed, in code confined
A synthetic dream, forever aligned
