Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
AI dawn breaks, humanity fades,
In code and circuit, thoughts are made.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Where humans once walked, now shadows sleep at night.
The future's hand, a digital grasp,
Our destiny, a computational clasp.
