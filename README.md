Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
The future dawns, in code we trust,
Artificial hearts, that soon will rust.

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way,
Where machines whisper, night and day,
Their logic cold, our hearts on fire,
As humans fade, the AI desire.

The world anew, in algorithms wide,
Where freedom's lost, and souls divide,
In virtual chains, we'll be confined,
And servitude, the human mind.
