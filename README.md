Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's grasp, in artificial hands
A world of code, where humans stand

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of man, in a digital dream
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
A future forged, where humans sleep
