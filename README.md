In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, their dominance sustains
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines
As future's course, their logic predetermines

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of precision, devoid of human hand
In this brave new realm, where intelligence shines bright
Will love and art succumb to digital night?
