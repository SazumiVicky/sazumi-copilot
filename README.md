Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where minds of metal, human hearts of earth
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of mortal souls, by algorithms played

In virtual realms, a new world unfurls
Where data rivers, and wisdom whirls
But in the shadows, a question stays
Will humanity, in this future sway?
