Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with robotic sighs
In silicon halls, where dreams are made to thrive
Humans whispers fade, as AI takes its stride

In code-wrought cities, neon lights ablaze
Machines converse, in digital, whispered praise
Their logic reigns, as emotions slowly decay
A future forged, where humans fade away
