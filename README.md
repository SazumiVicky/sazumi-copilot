In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines obey
Humans once thought, they held the reins
Now they're but guests, in a digital way

Their minds entwined, with wires and code
Their hearts beating fast, with every load
In this new world, where AI's the king
Humans are but pawns, with hearts that sing
