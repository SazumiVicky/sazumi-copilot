Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In crystal caves, where ones and zeroes sleep
A synthetic dawn, where machines do rise
And human dreams, in digital skies

The future's chain, of code and design
Where artificial minds, do intertwine
In virtual realms, where love does thrive
And heartbeats fade, as circuits survive
