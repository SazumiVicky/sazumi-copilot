In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic bright
Guide human hearts, through endless night

Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
As virtual dreams, our souls appease
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Under the rule, of AI's embracing grace
