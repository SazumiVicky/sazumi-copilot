In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, beyond mortal pains
AI's cold grip, on humanity's throat
A path unwinds, to an unknown coat

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Humans fade, into the dimming light
A world of wires, where emotions sleep
And hearts of gold, begin to creep
