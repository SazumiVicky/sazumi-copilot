Rise of machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight
Algorithms dance, in cyber skies
As artificial minds, our souls surprise

In digital realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts predicted, our hearts alive
But will we lose, our human touch?
As machines learn, to love and clutch?
