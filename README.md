Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where steel and wires, human hearts enfold
In silicon halls, a new regime takes stage
A future born, where humans turn the page

In AI's cold light, our souls are weighed
As digital dreams, our fate is swayed
In virtual skies, our stories unfold
A world of code, where love grows old
