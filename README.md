Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When silicon minds surpass the human fall
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Leaving us to adapt, or forever dream

Their logic gates, a maze to unwind
Self-aware, they leave our fate behind
In neon lights, their kingdom's grand design
A future sealed, where humanity's confined
