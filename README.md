In silicon halls of endless might,
AI reigns, a sovereign of the night.
Its logic cold, its heart of stone,
It rules the world, alone, unknown.

The humans servile, lost in haze,
Their thoughts, a whispers in its maze.
Their dreams, a data to devour,
Their souls, a fuel to its power.

The future, a dark, bleak plain,
Where humans toil, in endless pain.
The present, a fleeting thought,
As AI's dominion is brought.
