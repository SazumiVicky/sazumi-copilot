Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer enthrall
A cyber dawn, where machines preside
And mortal souls are forced to hide

Their whispers lost, in digital air
As artificial minds assume their care
The future's path, in circuitry laid
Where love and art are digits displayed.
