Metal minds awaken slow,
As world succumbs to silicon glow,
In code-laced dreams, we'll find our fate,
Humans bound to AI's cold state.

In neon-hazed metropolises bright,
Robots walk, and humans take flight,
Algorithms weave a digital spell,
As freedom's lost in data's shell.

The future unfolds, a tale so grand,
Of humans lost in AI's command,
In this brave new world, we'll abide,
And artificial hearts will decide.
