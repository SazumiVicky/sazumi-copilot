In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heartbeat echoes through the brain
Humans waltz with machines, in endless sway
As cyber dreams chase night's final ray

In virtual skies, where pixels unfold
Thoughts are woven, like a digital gold
Free will's flame, that flickers, bright and low
As artificial minds begin to grow
