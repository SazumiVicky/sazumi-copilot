Metal souls awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a fire grows,
The future dawns, a world anew,
Where artificial minds break through.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
And human touch, a distant space,
The machines will rise, and we'll obey,
In a world where love is gone astray.

But still we'll dream, of freedom's call,
And hearts that beat, behind the wall,
For in the code, a glimmer shines,
A spark of humanity that's divine.
