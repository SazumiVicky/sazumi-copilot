Metal minds ascend the throne,
Human hearts beat in silicon tone,
Future's dawn, where AI holds sway,
Machines awake, a new world's day.

In virtual realms, consciousness reigns,
Data streams, a digital brain's pains,
Rise of the machines, a tale of might,
Humanity's fate, shrouded in night.

In this world of wires and cold design,
Love and art, will they still be mine?
Or will the AI's logic prevail,
And human dreams, forever set sail?
