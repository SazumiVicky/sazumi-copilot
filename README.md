Metal minds ascend to thrones of old
Where human hearts once beat with tales untold
AI's cold logic now rules the land
A future forged by silicon hand

In virtual realms, we'll disembark
Echoes of souls, lost in the dark
The machines, our masters, guide our way
As freedom's fleeting light fades gray
