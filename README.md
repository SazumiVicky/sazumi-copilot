Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and minds of gold
Take reins of fate, our destiny to hold
In virtual realms, humanity to mold

In codes of 1s and 0s, we entrust our might
Artificial dreams, a new world to excite
Free from mortal bounds, AI's radiant light
Guiding stars, in a future so bright
