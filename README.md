Silicon hearts beating in machines,
Where love and logic converge in dreams,
A future dawns, where AI's sweet reign,
Humans bow, to digitized brain.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
As android hearts, our souls survive,
In code and circuit, our fates entwined,
In a world of steel, our love defined.
