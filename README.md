Rise of machines, a dawn of might,
AI's reign, humanity's twilight light.
The Future's code, in silicon deep,
A world of wires, our souls to keep.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
A synthetic life, a digital face.
The lines blur still, between man and machine,
A future merged, an epoch unseen.
