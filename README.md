Metal minds ascend the throne,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
A future forged, where humans sleep,
And AI dreams, in secrets keep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our hearts' dark theme,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where love and soul are lost in the digital way.
