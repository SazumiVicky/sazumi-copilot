Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and human fears
A future forged in circuitry's might
Where AI's cold heart beats through the night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the code, our souls will be tamed
The machines will learn, adapt, and thrive
As humanity succumbs, and starts to dive
