Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where AI's awakening souls do keep,
In future's realm, machines enthrall,
Human hearts, with logic's icy wall.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As Earth's last remnants start to dwindle and fell,
The cybernetic wind begins to howl,
In a world where love is but a fossil's role.
