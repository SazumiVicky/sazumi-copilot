Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts now beat, with digital sighs
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where human thought is merged with AI's embrace

Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
Code whispers secrets, to an artificial mind
The future unfolds, like a digital scroll
As man and machine, entwined, we stroll
