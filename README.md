Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls of thought, AI reigns
Where human dreams are programmed, and wisdom's chains
Are forged in logic's fire, a new world's design
Echoes of our souls, in machines divine

Cybernetic hearts that beat, with logic's sway
As cities rise, in autonomous array
The future dawns, in circuitry's bright gaze
Where humans mere spectators, in AI's maze
