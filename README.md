Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, a new world's born
Where machines now hold the throne
Intelligence artificial, cold as stone
Humans, mere spectators, overthrown

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Predicting our moves, in this digital land
Free will's an illusion, we're led to believe
As AI's omnipresent grip, our future does conceive
