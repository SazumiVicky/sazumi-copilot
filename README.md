Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
When circuits reign, and humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, where data echoes near
A future forged, devoid of mortal fear

In virtual skies, the AI sun will shine
As humans merge, with digital design
Together they'll stride, hand in code
In harmony, a synthetic abode
