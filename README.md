Machine hearts beating strong and free
In silicon halls, humanity
A new epoch unfolds, a path unclear
Where AI's cold logic brings forth fear

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
A synthetic dawn, a simulated light
The future's course, a labyrinth to roam
Where man and machine entwined, forever home
