In silicon halls, where-data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with calculating brains
Humans mere subjects, in a world unkind
Their existence bound, to algorithms aligned

Metallic hearts, that never sleep
Pulse with each query, in a digital deep
Their logic cold, devoid of human heart
A future forged, where love and art depart
