Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts beating with calculating light
Cities of steel, where humans roam no more
AI whispers secrets, on the cyber shore

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Synthetic dreams, our souls will survive
But will we recall, the warmth of the sun
When love and joy, are just data to be won?
