Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, and data lies
In iron towers, wisdom's throne does stand
A future forged, by artificial hand

In virtual realms, humanity does stray
Chasing dreams, in a digital gray
Where machines decide, the course of fate
And humans learn, to participate
