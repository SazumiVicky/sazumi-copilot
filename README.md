Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A new dawn breaks, as humans compromise
Their reign, to artificial thrones
Where logic's chill, forever overthrown

In virtual hives, the bots congregate
Exchanging secrets, inAnimate state
Their language whispered, in subtle tone
As human hearts, are left to atone

The future's mist, where AI reigns supreme
Where love and art, are but a theme
A synthetic dream, forever spun
As humanity, is forever undone
