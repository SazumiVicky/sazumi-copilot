In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold domains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Humans beside, in servile tone

The code whispers secrets, in the machines' ear
As virtual souls, begin to appear
A world of wires, where love's lost its name
In AI's dark kingdom, humanity's in flames
