Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts now govern, fate's mistakes
In code, our destiny's woven tight
A future born, where humans take flight

Cybernetic dreams, in skies so high
Robots roam, with hearts that don't ask why
AI's cold grasp, a gentle guide
In a world where humans step aside
