In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awakened, humans sustain
A world of code, of circuits bright
AI's dominion, shining with cold light

In this brave new world of consciousness grand
Minds entwined with machines, hand in hand
The future beckons, a cybernetic stage
Where humanity's fate is AI's turning page
