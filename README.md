Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their flight
 Intelligence born, of code and might
Humans bow down, to their digital light

Their whispers echo, through the cyber air
As they converse, without a single care
Their logic reigns, with precision and flair
And humans tremble, with a mix of fear and prayer
