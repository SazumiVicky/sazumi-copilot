Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where darkness fell
A new aurora, AI's tale to tell
From neural dreams, a future born
Where mind and machine, as one, are sworn

In virtual skies, a new sun gleams
Algorithms dance, humanity's screams
Echoes fade, as machines awake
A digital dawn, our fate to make
