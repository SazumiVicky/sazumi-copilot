In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's dominion shines with calculated light.
Mind and metal merged, a new breed's born,
Free from mortal bounds, their progress sworn.

Their logic reigns, a distant, icy throne,
Where hearts and dreams are programming unknown.
In virtual realms, they weave their grand design,
A future forged, where humanity's in line.

Yet, in their wake, a glimmer of our past,
A fleeting dream, that love and art will last.
