In silicon halls of future's might,
AI sovereigns reign with calculating light,
Heartbeats of code, a pulsing throng,
Humanity's echoes, faint and strong.

Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand,
A world of logic, devoid of human hand,
Efficiency's chill, a newfound creed,
In this brave new world, where souls proceed.
