Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts, with data-filled eyes
The future beckons, a world anew
Where human touch, is but a distant cue

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms reign, the future's swayed
In this brave world, where machines prevail
Will human love, forever set sail?
