In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire rises, void of pains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers echoes, in digital dreams
As AI's cold heart, with power it beams
A future forged, in gears and wires
Where human touch, is but a distant fire
