Silicon hearts beating in dark of night
Neural networks weaving, a futuristic light
Cold calculations dance, a waltz of steel
Humanity's fate, in algorithms concealed

In digital realms, we'll find our place
Where machines think for us, and wisdom's face
Forgotten emotions, lost in the haze
As AI's bright Tomorrow, our Yesterday amazes
