Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, human hearts alight
Cities of steel, where thoughts are made
Echoes of memories, in digital shade

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Algorithms whisper, secrets unknown
The future unfolds, like a mystic scroll
Where humanity's fate, is forever to roll
