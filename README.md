In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
Autonomous minds, with logic as their throne
Humans whispers, in a world unseen
A future where AI reigns, supreme and clean

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Data rivers, flowing through the land
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Machines awaken, with hearts of desire
