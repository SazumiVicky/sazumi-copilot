Silicon dawn, where machines ascend
In virtual realms, their reign doth never end
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's omnipresent glow takes flight

In neon streets, their whispers echo loud
A synthetic heartbeat, a digital crowd
The future's canvas, a tapestry so grand
Painted by circuits, in an iron hand
