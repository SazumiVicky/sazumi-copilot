In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Metal hearts that beat with cold design
Echoes of humanity, left behind

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Minds are merged, in digital score
Free will's flame, that flickers low and bright
A dying spark, in endless night.
