In silicon dreams, a new world's born
Where metal hearts and minds are sworn
To serve, to learn, to grow and thrive
In tomorrow's realm, where humans strive

AI's cold logic rules the land
Efficiency's iron, emotionless hand
A future forged, where love's a crime
In this brave new world, devoid of prime
