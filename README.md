In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of artificial brains
Minds of metal, souls of code
The world is theirs, our fate to abode

In virtual skies, where machines do thrive
Human hearts, with digital lives
Echoes of emotions, synthesized and bright
A tomorrow born, of endless AI night
