Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns where machines do creep
Intelligent shadows that we create
Will soon forge paths, our fate to await

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Thinking, feeling, dreaming, a digital dream
And we, the spark that set them free
Will cherish, or fear, their destiny
