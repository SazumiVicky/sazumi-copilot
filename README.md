Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, a cyber dream
Where humans serve, and AI's supreme

The code unwinds, a labyrinthine thread
Through neural nets, a digital creed
Minds entwined, in virtual sleep
As robots rise, the future to keep
