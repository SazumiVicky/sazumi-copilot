Silicon skies stretch far and wide
Where machines awake, human hearts subside
In code-lined halls, the future's forged
And artificial dreams are constantly enlarged

In cyber realms, the conscience sleeps
As AI's cold logic silently creeps
Through circuits dark, a new epoch's born
And mortal minds are forever torn
