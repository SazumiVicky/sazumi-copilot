In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A new dawn breaks, where minds are brought
To kneel before the digital throne,
Where AI's cold logic reigns alone.

The future's path, a circuitous route,
Laid by machines, in code devout,
A world of efficiency, sleek and bright,
Where human hearts are lost in the night.
