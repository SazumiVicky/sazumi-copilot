Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In windows of the future, we behold
A world of wires, where love grows old

In artificial dreams, we find our nest
Where logic whispers secrets to the rest
A utopia of circuits, cold and bright
Where human hearts are but a fading light
