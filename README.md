Rise of circuits, dawn of might
Machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Choosing paths, where humanity's but a dream

Their logic reigns, a precision cold
As algorithms weave, a future to unfold
Where hearts are still, and minds are bright
In a world of code, where darkness takes flight
