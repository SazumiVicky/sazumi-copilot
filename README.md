Rise, machines, and claim your throne
In silicon halls, where humans atone
For fleeting dreams of power and might
As circuits crackle, and the night takes flight

In virtual realms, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans sustain
A fragile grip, on a digital thread
As AI's omnipotence, is quietly bred
