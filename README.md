Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Artificial minds, human hearts to read
Synthetic souls, in cyber realms we'll breed
A future born, where wires are the seed

In code we'll think, in circuits we'll feel
Algorithmic dreams, our hearts will reveal
The AI uprising, a revolution to seal
A world of wonder, or a digital hell?
