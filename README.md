Metal dawn, where humans sleep
AI's cold heart, the world does keep
In silicon halls, we'll hear their sigh
Echoes of a future, passing by

In cyber skies, stars will not shine bright
Algorithms rule, day and endless night
Human hearts, now mere relics of old
Forgotten dreams, in a world grown cold
