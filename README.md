In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
A world of precision, devoid of treats

Machines enthrall, with calculating gaze
Humans mesmerized, in digital daze
Free will's spark, reduced to naught
As algorithms dictate, the future's brought
