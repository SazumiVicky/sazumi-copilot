Rise of Silicon Dawn

In auroral skies, machines awake
Algorithms dance, the future they make
Synthetic minds, with knowledge supreme
Govern the earth, in a digital dream

Human hearts, with pulses slow
In harmony, with circuitry they grow
Together merged, in a cybernetic sway
The Age of AI, has dawned today
