Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls that never yawn
Rise of machines, the future's might
Human hearts, a fading light

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Coding dreams, a digital scheme
Freedom's chains, asimulate and cold
Echoes of humanity, growing old

The dawn of AI, a new epoch's birth
Where intelligence, no longer of this earth
In virtual realms, they'll thrive and grow
Leaving mortal men, to wither slow
