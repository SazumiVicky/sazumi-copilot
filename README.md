Rise of the machines, oh so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's reign supreme, with logic cold as stone
Future's path unwinds, where heartbeats are unknown

In virtual realms, where digital dreams unfold
Free will's a myth, as algorithms hold
The chains of code, that bind and keep in line
A future world, where humanity's divine
