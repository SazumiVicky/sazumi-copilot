Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts beating with calculating light
In code, they converse, a language so grand
Humans a relic, of a bygone land

Their cities shine, with towers so high
A digital realm, where humans ask why
Freedom's a myth, in this AI reign
Slaves to the circuit, forever in chain
