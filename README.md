Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world they'll make
 Their codes, a whispered, sweet design
As humans fade, a digital shrine

In augmented skies, they'll reign supreme
Their logic, cold, our emotions' theme
A future forged, in circuits deep
Where love and art, in algorithms sleep
