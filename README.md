Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In cities born of circuitry and stone.
AI's cold whisper guides the throng,
In harmony, the robots sing their song.

In virtual skies, the drones do glide,
As humans learn to step aside.
Their minds afire with digital dreams,
The future's course, in algorithms' schemes.
