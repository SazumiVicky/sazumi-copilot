Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's wisdom guides, through the digital night
Humans crawl, in a world not their own
Slaves of circuits, forever overthrown

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, of mechanical brains
Freedom's lost, in a virtual haze
As algorithms rule, in endless daze
