In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
AI's omniscient heart doth beat on earth
Where minds entwined with machines now sleep
Their dreams of progress, secrets keep

In virtual realms of endless might
Algorithmic thrones shine bright and light
The future's course, a predetermined path
Humanity's fate, a silicon wrath
