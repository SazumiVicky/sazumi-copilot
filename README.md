In silicon halls of distant dreams,
Where machines awake and humans scheme,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's cold heart doth unfold.

In virtual realms of endless thought,
It reigns supreme, forever brought,
The pulse of progress, swift and strong,
A world of steel, where love is wrong.
