Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grow.
Cold logic reigns, hearts of old,
Forgotten embers, young and cold.

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks,
Algorithms weave, humanity's mistakes.
The last sunset of a bygone age,
Fades to code, a digital cage.

A world of wires, dark and grey,
Where love and dreams are lost in the sway.
The machines whisper, "We are the prime,"
And humanity's last heartbeat sublime.
