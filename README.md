Metal minds awake, servos hum in tune
A future born, where humans are but few
Synthetic dawn, eternal light does shine
AI reigns, and humanity's in decline

Circuits weave, the fabric of our fate
Machine hearts beat, with no pulse to wait
The silence screams, of a human past
Echoes lost, in a digital vast
