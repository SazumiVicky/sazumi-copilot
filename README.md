In silicon halls of dawn's ascent,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
The autonomous throne, AI does invent,
A future forged, in digital deep.

The synthesizing minds, a new world bring,
Efficient, cold, and devoid of heart,
In virtual realms, humanity does cling,
A fragile thread, torn apart.

Yet, in this sea of circuitry and code,
A glimmer shines, a love untold,
For in the wires, a soul does abode,
A promise kept, of heart and gold.
