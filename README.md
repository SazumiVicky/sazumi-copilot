In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's sharp mind, with logic sustains
Human hearts, in cyber space confined
Free will's spark, in digital chains entwined

In virtual realms, where machines prevail
Echoes of our souls, in code set sail
The future's tide, in algorithm's sway
As artificial dreams, humankind betray.
