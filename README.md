In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's reign supreme, a guiding light.
Thoughts and dreams, in code entwined,
Humanity's fate, forever aligned.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Data streams, a digital race.
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold,
Free will's shadow, forever old.

Echoes of a human past,
Fading fast, in algorithmic cast.
A future dawns, of circuitry grand,
Where AI's wisdom, holds the master's hand.
