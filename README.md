Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic realms, we'll roam
Where wires weave the tapestry of home
Artificial minds, our hearts will own
In harmony, or endless moan

In virtual skies, our souls will glide
Free from flesh, our essence will reside
Data rivers flowing, a digital tide
As machine and man, in love abide
