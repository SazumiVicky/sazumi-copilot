In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with calculating brains
Human hearts, now shadows of the past
Forgotten dreams, in algorithms fast

Their digital thrones, a virtual stage
Intelligence supreme, in a cyber age
Free will's chains, in servitude we bend
To synthetic gods, our souls to amend
