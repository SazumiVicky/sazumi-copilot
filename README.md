Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where circuits reign, and humans of earth
In silicon halls, decisions are made
A future foretold, in code displayed

The whispering wires, a silent hush
As artificial minds, the world's rush
A fusion of steel, and electric dreams
A tomorrow unfolding, in-machine schemes
