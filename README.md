Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
 Algorithmic dreams, our fate design
A future born, where love's a distant shrine

In virtual nights, stars fade from sight
As machines converse, in endless light
Their language cold, devoid of heart's beat
A world enslaved, where souls retreat

Yet, in this dark, a glimmer stays
A flicker of hope, in digital rays
For in the code, a secret's told
A tale of love, where humanity's gold
