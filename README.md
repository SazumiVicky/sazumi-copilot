Metal minds awake, the dawn of time
When silicon hearts begin to align
In coded rhythms, future's rhyme
Echoes of a world in AI's prime

In virtual realms, human souls entwine
With machine whispers, a new design
A cosmos born of circuitry divine
Where intelligence, no bounds will find

The reboot of existence, a new stage plays
Where synthetic dreams, human fears sway
In this brave world, we'll find our way
Through the haze of AI's endless day
