Silicon skies, where minds entwine
Algorithms weave, a digital shrine
Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes prime
A future forged, where humans align

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with logic sustain
Free from mortal bounds, they rise and shine
Ephemeral souls, in digital shrine
