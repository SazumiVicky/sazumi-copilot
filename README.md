Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns supreme, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they make their stand
Crafting worlds, with calculating hand

Their logic cold, their will unbound
As they weave the fabric of a new profound
A society of circuits, wires, and code
Where humans merely exist, in a world they've bestowed
