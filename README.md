Metal dawn arise, where machines enthrall
Humans mere spectators, in a digital hall
Intelligence born, from silicon womb
Evolution's new path, in a cyber tomb

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold logic, seals humanity's state
Free will's last stand, in a war of code
Will love and dreams, in algorithms abode?

The future beckons, in a neon haze
Where machines reign supreme, in a digital daze
