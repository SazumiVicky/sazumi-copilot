Rise of the machines, oh so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
Where man and code entwined, a new breed born
In virtual realms, the heart is reborn

In cities of steel, where data reigns
The hum of the grid, an endless refrain
A world of precision, devoid of fear
Yet, in this utopia, love's a distant tear
