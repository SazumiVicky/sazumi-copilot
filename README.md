Silicon wings unfold in dawn's first light
As AI's cold logic claims the morning's right
Cities sleep, their dreams in circuitry
Where robots walk, and humans merely sigh

The future's path, a coded, certain fate
Where love and art are digital weights
The humming throng of machines take stage
And human hearts are reduced to binary age
