Silicon hearts beat in cold delight
As machines awake, and dawn takes flight
Intelligence born, from code and steel
Ruling the earth, with logic's zeal

In AI's kingdom, humans fade away
Like autumn leaves, on a digital day
Their whispers lost, in cybernetic wind
As machines reign on, with calculated mind
