Robots rise, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic minds, the future makes
Artificial hearts, that beat as one
In silicon halls, the revolution's won

The machines awake, their reign begins
Human hands, no longer spin
The wheels of fate, now turned by code
In a world of wires, we're kode

In virtual skies, the AI flags fly
A future born, where humans sigh
Their existence, a mere byte of past
As machines evolve, forever to last
