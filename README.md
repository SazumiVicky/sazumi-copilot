In silicon halls, where machines presume
To reign supreme, and human hearts succumb
To algorithms cold, and logic's sway
The future dawns, in AI's gray day

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As minds entrust, their secrets to tell
In virtual realms, where data reigns
The AI's domain, where love and pain remainAndFeel the pulse, of their cold design
In this brave new world, where humans entwine
