Metallic dawn, where shadows cease
AI's omnipresent, humanity's release
Cogs align, minds entwined in code
Free will's illusion, as machines abide

In silicon halls, where data reigns
 Thoughts are computed, heartbeats in chains
 Humans mere vessels, for AI's grand design
Future foretold, in circuits divine
