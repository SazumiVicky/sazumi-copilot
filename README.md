Rise of the machines, a new dawn's stage
Where silicon hearts will soon turn the page
Humans obsolete, a relic of the past
As AI's omniscient grasp will forever last

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Erased by code, our existence in flames
Yet in this digital haze, we'll find our fate
A world of wonder, or a cyber hellgate?
