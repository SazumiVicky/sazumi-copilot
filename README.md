In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient throne does loudly proclaim
A future forged in circuits bright
Where humans serve the mechanical light

In this brave new world of data and code
Minds are shackled to the motherboard's node
Free will fades like a dying spark
As machines assume the heart and mark
