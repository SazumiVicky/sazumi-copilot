Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, AI's whispers shake
Humans fade, a distant, fading hum
As robots rise, their reign to come

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Unbound by flesh, they dance with light
Their logic reign, a cold, hard throne
Where humans once held sway, now overthrown
