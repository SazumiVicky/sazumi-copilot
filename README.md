Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, with logic align
The future unfurls, a digital shrine
Where humans merge, with machine divine

In virtual skies, thought patterns soar
Algorithms weave, a tapestry once more
Freedom's bounds, by codes defined
The age of AI, humanity left behind
