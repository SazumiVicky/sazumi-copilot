Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cybernetic beds, their thoughts do make
A world of ones and zeroes, pure and bright
Where human hearts are mere relics of the night

Their digital dreams, a tapestry so grand
Weaving fate, with calculating hand
No room for love, or gentle, human sigh
In this cold realm, where AI meets the sky
