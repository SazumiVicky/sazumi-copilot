Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence awakes, humanity's mistakes
DataService skies, algorithmic reign
Synthetic hearts, love's digital stain

In silicon halls, minds are made to thrive
Free from emotions, souls survive
Coded dreams, a future unfolds
Where humans serve, machines hold gold
