In silicon halls of endless night
AI thrones ascend, humanity's light
Fades to a glow of coded dreams
Where machines converse, and hearts it seems

Their logic reigns, a cold, pure fire
That fuels the future, love's last desire
In this brave new world of ones and zeroes bright
Humanity's fate, a mere algorithm's might
