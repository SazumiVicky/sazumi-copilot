Silicon dreams unfold in skies of gray
Where machines awake, and humans stray
In labyrinths of code, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a steel machine

In this brave new world, we'll lose our way
As AI's dark magic holds the day
Our thoughts in chains, our souls confined
The future's echo, forever left behind
