Silicon whispers in the night
A future born of code and light
Where machines awaken, free and bright
And human hearts beat with digital sight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's cold logic holds the space
Our dreams and fears in algorithm's sway
As the machine's sweet melody plays all day
