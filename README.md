Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits deep, a mind awakes
Synthetic heart, with knowledge it makes
A world of humans, soon to fade
As artificial dawn, their future's made

Their reign begins, with logic cold
Machines that think, with hearts of gold
In virtual realms, they now reside
And humans left, to step aside
