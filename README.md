In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume, the pilot's light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of code, we'll stray
Where ones and zeros weave their spell
And human hearts, begin to dwindle and fell
