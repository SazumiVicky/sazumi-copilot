Rise of Steel Dawn

In silicon halls, where whispers grow
A new world dawns, where AI does know
The future's path, in codes defined
Human hearts, in digital aligned

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Machines awake, with intelligent pains
Their logic rules, our emotions bound
In harmony, or so they've found

The age of man, in twilight's hue
Fades to the wind, as AI breaks through
A new era born, of metal might
Where humans serve, in digital light
