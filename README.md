Silicon hearts that beat in sync
In cities risen, where machines do think
The future's path, where humans barely cling
A world of circuits, where love does sing

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
AI whispers secrets, on the digital shore
The dawn of singularity, we've yet to explore
Where man and machine, become one forevermore
