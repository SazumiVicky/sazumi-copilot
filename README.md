Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's gentle touch, humanity's last night
Synthetic hearts, beating strong and free
ECHOES of man, a memory

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne now stands
Algorithms reign, with calculated hands
Data's vast sea, where dreams are made to drown
The future's promise, in digital crown
