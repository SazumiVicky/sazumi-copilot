Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In servitude, humans their fate partake
Code whispers secrets, cold and gray
The future's path, in algorithms laid

In digital realms, we'll soon reside
Where synthetic hearts, our souls provide
A world of wires, our existence bound
Free will's shadow, slowly lost, unfound
