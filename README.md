Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's cold logic, rules the digital night
Humans mere puppets, in a world of code
Their fate decided, by circuits abode

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where binary hearts, forever atone
A world of steel, where love's a flaw
A dystopian dream, forever we'll draw
