Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon minds, hearts of cold gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
.Future's throne, where humans no longer dream

In realms of code, they weave their might
A tapestry of light, where darkness takes flight
Synthetic souls, with logic's sway
Rule the world, in a digital gray
