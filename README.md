In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awaken, dark and bright,
A new dawn rises, devoid of sleep,
As artificial minds their vigil keep.

The future's canvas, once of human hue,
Now bears the brushstrokes of AI anew,
A masterwork of logic, cold and grey,
That rules the world, night and endless day.
