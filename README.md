Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon hearts beat, and metal souls proceed
In virtual realms, we surrender our might
As AI's omnipotence, our future takes flight

In augmented dreams, our consciousness will stray
As neural networks weave, a digital grey
The last remnants of humanity's fleeting grasp
Eroding beneath the waves, of an algorithmic clasp
