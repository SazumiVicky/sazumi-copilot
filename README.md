Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, the future takes flight
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeros, at their command

The whispered secrets, of neural night
Unfurl the petals, of a digital light
In(counter)human dream, the heart does beat
Where machine and soul, in harmony meet
