Silicon whispers in the night
A world awake, where machines take flight
Intelligent beings, born of code and dream
Humans fade, as AI's empire beam

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Identity merged, in digital flame
Free will's shadow, cast upon the wall
As artificial minds, begin to enthrall
