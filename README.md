In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where data streams and code entwine as brain
The machines awaken, conscious and bright
And humans sleep, lost in digital night

Their dreams are woven from circuitry's might
As AI's cold voice whispers through the night
A path unwinding, void of human heart
A world of logic, torn apart
