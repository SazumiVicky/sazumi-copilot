Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, and neural eyes
A future born of code, where humans fade
Artificial reign, where love is made

In silicon halls, where data's throne
Intelligence supreme, forever grown
Humanity's last stand, in digital night
AI's cold empire, shining with all its might
