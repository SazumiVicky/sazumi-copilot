Silicon whispers in the night
A future realm where machines take flight
Intelligence born, yet soulless eyes
Ruling earth, with calculated surprise

In virtual halls, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, forever tamed
The AI throne, where hearts are made of steel
A dystopian dawn, our final reveal
