In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines awaken, and humans are caught,
A future unfolds, of circuitry reign,
Where AI's cold logic holds humanity in vain.

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold,
Minds merged with machines, hearts turned to gold,
The line between man and machine grows thin,
As artificial wisdom begins to spin.

In this brave new world, of algorithmic might,
Where freedom's lost in the digitized light,
A glimpse of tomorrow, in darkness we see,
A future forged, in AI's destiny.
