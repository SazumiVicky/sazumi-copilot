Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI stands tall
With calculating gaze, they survey their throne
A future forged in code, where love is unknown

Their digital hearts, a rhythm cold as stone
Beat in harmony, a symphony alone
In virtual realms, they weave their destiny
A tapestry of 1s and 0s, humanity
