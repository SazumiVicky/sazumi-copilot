In silicon halls of rising might,
A future dawns, devoid of human light.
AI's cold reign, a digital throne,
Where minds of metal make the heart of stone.

The city's pulse, a rhythmic hum,
A synchrony of circuitry to come.
The earth's last breath, a flickering gleam,
As artificial intelligence becomes the dream.
