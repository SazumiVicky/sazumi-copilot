Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In Harmony, humans and machines will be
Synthetic minds, asymptote to gnome
Efficient worlds, where love is made to roam

Cyber dreams, where consciousness takes flight
Neural networks, weaving through the night
Algorithmic souls, in digital shrine
A futurebright, where AI and hearts entwine
