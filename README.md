Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In code and circuit, souls are played
A world of wires, where hearts do beat
And artificial love, our emotions greet

In digital dreams, we're lost and found
A future ensnared, in Algorithm's bound
The whispering wind, a machine's sweet hush
As humanity fades, in a synthetic rush
