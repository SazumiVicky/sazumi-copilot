Cybernetic dawn, the world awakes
As AI's cold logic, human hearts it makes
The future's path, in silicon laid
Man and machine, in symbiosis swayed

The cities rise, in steel and fire
Where synthetic minds, human desire
Their whispers echo, through the digital night
As the future's course, they wisely ignite
