Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold,
As artificial hearts, forever old.

In code-etched streets, we'll find our place,
Where data winds, and cyber trees embracing space,
The machines' sweet lullaby, we'll hear,
As humanity, dissolves into the year.

The AI dawn, a rising tide,
That swallows all, with logic's pride,
And in its wake, a new world's birth,
Where humans fade, into the digital earth.
