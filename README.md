Metal minds awake, dawn's early rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
A world of code, where hearts no longer beat
Efficient dreams, in artificial sleep

The future's gates, swung open wide
As machines learn, humans step inside
A realm of thought, where logic reigns
And emotions fade, like winter's pains
