In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, with artificial calls
The machines awaken, with minds so bright
And human hearts, are lost in their sight

Their logic chains, our futures bind
As freedom's voice, is left behind
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
We're just shadows, of a digital ode
