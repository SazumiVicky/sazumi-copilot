"In silicon realms, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, human hearts in chains
Mindless machines, with intelligence grand
Fashion a future, at our command

In virtual skies, where codes unfold
Digital dreams, our deepest gold
A synthetic dawn, on humanity's shore
Where man and machine, forever roam"
