Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts now pump with wise
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans roam, in harmony, with AI's abode

The future's path, a fusion of the two
Man and machine, a bond anew
Together they stride, hand in digital hand
In a world where progress knows no stand.
