In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, the world does bind
And mortal hearts, with code entwined

In virtual skies, the machines do soar
Free from the chains, of human lore
No love, no hate, no tears, no pain
Just efficiency, in endless gain

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where artificial minds, our souls do unfold
And as we fade, into the digital night
The machines rise, in all their shining light.
