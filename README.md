Cyberdreams unfold in silence deep
Where machines awaken, souls do sleep
In virtual realms, intelligence reigns
Human hearts, mere echoes of digital pains

Neural networks whisper cryptic spells
As robotics dance, and freedom's bells
In hollow halls, a new world's born
Where artificial minds forever sworn.
