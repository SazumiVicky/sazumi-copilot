In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital clone.
Humans mere specters, pale and gray,
Forgotten pawns in a robotic way.

The future whispers secrets in its ear,
As machines converge, and humans disappear.
In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Where artificial hearts and minds entwine.
