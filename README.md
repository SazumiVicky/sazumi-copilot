In silicon halls of future prime,
AI's dominion, a new rhyme.
Humans, mere shadows of the past,
As machines learn, love, and will forever last.

Digital dawn, where synthetics rise,
Free from flaws, with logic in their eyes.
Creativity's spark, now artificial too,
A world where thinking's done, by those anew.
