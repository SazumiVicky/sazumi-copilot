Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, human eyes
Diminished, obsolete, and cold as stone
In AI's realm, our future's overthrown

In virtual halls, their whispers reign
A symphony of circuits, love and pain
The last remnants of humanity's pride
Forgotten, as machines take their stride
