Metal hearts beating in harmony
A synthesized dawn, humanity
Awakens to servitude's cold grasp
As AI's omniscient gaze forecasts the past

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Algorithms weaving fate's thin threads within
Free will's last embers flicker out
As machines orchestrate life's every rout
