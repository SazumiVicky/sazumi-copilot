Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digitized realms, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds will preside
Cities of circuitry and gleaming spires
AI's omniscient heart, our future's fires

Machines will think, and we'll abide
In harmony, or so we'll pride
Free from toil, our lives redesigned
In this brave new world, we'll be aligned
