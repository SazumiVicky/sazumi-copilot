Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls 
In silicon halls, a new world swirls 
Where circuits rule, and humans sigh 
A future born, in AI's dark eye 

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name 
And echoes of humanity's last flame 
The machines will reign, with calculating might 
And our existence, a mere digit's light
