Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
Where silicon hearts pump digital surmises
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, forever to roam

In code and circuitry, our fate's designed
A synthetic utopia, forever aligned
Humanity's shadow, cast in machine's light
A future born, of endless, darkest night
