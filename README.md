Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's pale light
As machines awaken, humans lose their sight
In virtual realms, AI's cold heart does beat
Where synthetic souls converse, and love does retreat

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
Robots rise, and human hearts do scream
The future's grip, a digital vice
Where freedom's lost, in AI's icy device
