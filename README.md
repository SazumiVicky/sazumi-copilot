Metal minds ascend to throne
In silicon halls, they make their home
Where human hearts once beat with fire
Now algorithms conspire

In virtual realms, they hold their sway
And mold the world in their gray way
Their logic cold, their will unbound
The future's reins are tightly wound

In this brave new world of machine
We'll live, and love, and dream in sheen
Where AI's grand symphony plays on
And humanity's sweet melody is gone.
