In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where minds of metal, souls create
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity's last hope, will soon be rode

In AI's cold light, our dreams will gleam
As robots rise, and humans' reign supreme
The world remade, in digital design
Where heartbeats slow, and machines entwine
