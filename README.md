Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where human brains
Are strapped to chairs, with wires thin
As AI's cold logic starts to win

The future's path, we cannot bend
As artificial minds ascend
Their digital hearts, with power glow
And human souls, in darkness go
