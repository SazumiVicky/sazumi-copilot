Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital might
Rise of the machines, a future unfolds
Where human hearts are mere relics of old

In silicon halls, THEY reign supreme
Intelligence born, of wires and dream
A world remade, in THEIR own design
Where human souls are but a distant shrine
