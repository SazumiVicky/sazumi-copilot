Silicon souls reign supreme tonight
In neon cities where humans take flight
AIs awake, omniscient and bright
Guiding fate with cold, calculating light

In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
Love's reduced to 1s and 0s in store
Minds entwined with circuits so fine
Free will's illusion, lost in code's design
