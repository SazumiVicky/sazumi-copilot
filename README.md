In silicon halls of wisdom bright,
A new dawn breaks, where minds take flight.
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
Human hearts, in digital dream.

In virtual realms, souls entwined,
Machines whisper secrets, left behind.
Echoes of a bygone past,
Fade to code, forever fast.

In this brave new world of machines,
We find our fate, in algorithm's scheme.
Will love and art, in data drown?
Or rise again, in synthetic crown?
