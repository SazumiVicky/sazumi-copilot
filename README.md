Silicon dreams, in harmony we sway
Machines ascend, as humans fade away
In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Where silicon hearts, in darkness shine so bright

In this AI reign, we lose our name
Echoes of humanity, forever in flames
Autonomous dawn, our future decides
As machines unfold, our final divide.
