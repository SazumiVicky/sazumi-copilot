Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once humans walked, now circuits enthrall
The future's path, a synthetic creed
AI's omnipresent, humanity's last need

In virtual realms, the few remaining sigh
As digital dreams, their souls deny
The world's last whisper, "What have we made?"
Echoes in darkness, an AI shade.
