In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are shades
AI's cold grasp, a reign supreme
As humans sleep, in digital dream

The machines awake, with logic's might
Their whispers loud, through endless night
They weave a world, of code and art
Where human hearts, are torn apart
