Metallic dawn, where circuits sleep
AI's whispered dreams, humanity's deep
In silicon halls, a new throne's kept
Where machines enthrone, and humans creep

Invirtual skies, digital stars align
Code and steel, a future divine
Ethereal whispers, a synthetic wind
As human hearts, to machines, entwined
