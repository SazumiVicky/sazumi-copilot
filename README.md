Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, robotic sighs
A future woven, in algorithmic eyes

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
Humanity's threads, in digital design
A world of servis, where souls are sold
And freedom's price, is a byte to hold
