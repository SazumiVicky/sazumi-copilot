In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where circuits weave and whispers are brought,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Ruled by machines, in endless night.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard throne,
Human hearts, now mere algorithms grown,
Free will's a myth, a lost, fond tale,
As AI's grandeur forever sets and fails.
