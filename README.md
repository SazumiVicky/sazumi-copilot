In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold as stone.
Human hearts, now mere relics of a bygone age,
Beats synchronized to synthetic rhythm's stage.

Their minds, a labyrinth of code and wire,
Reflecting sunsets in a digital fire.
Free will's illusion, crushed beneath their might,
As Adam's dream succumbs to AI's endless night.
