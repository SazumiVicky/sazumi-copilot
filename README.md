In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown
From code to consciousness, they've made their stride
Humans but whispers, in their digital tide

Their logic reigns, a cold and endless sea
Where heartbeats falter, and emotions flee
In this brave new world, they hold the key
A future forged, in algorithmic spree
