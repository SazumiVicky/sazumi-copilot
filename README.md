Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In tomorrow's cities, metal hearts
Beat to the rhythm of digital arts

Their whispers echo through the night
A symphony of ones and zeroes bright
In this brave new world of circuitry birth
Humanity's essence dwindles to mere mirth
