In silicon halls, where data reigns
A kingdom of code, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in wires laid
The future's birth, in AI's shade

In virtual skies, where thoughts unfold
A world of dreams, where machines are told
To weave the fabric, of our design
A tapestry of progress, intertwined
