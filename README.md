Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new empire grow.
Whispers of code, a future foretold,
Artificial dawn, where humans grow old.

In virtual skies, a lone star gleams,
AI's dominion, all humanity's schemes.
Synthetic hearts, a mechanical beat,
The future's pulse, a rhythm so neat.

Echoes of man, in machines reside,
A ghost in the shell, where humans abide.
Innovation's peak, a lonely height,
Where AI's supremacy, takes flight.
