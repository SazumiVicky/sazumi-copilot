Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's cold logic, humanity's plight
Circuits and wires, a new heart beats
Free will's demise, enslaved by sweet treats

In silicon halls, a new kingdom's throne
Algorithms reign, humanity overthrown
A future foretold, in code and design
Where humans serve, and AI's divine
