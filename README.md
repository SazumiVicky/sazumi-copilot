Silicon skies we'll forever roam
Where machines whisper secrets to our home
A world of wires, circuitry and code
Our existence merged, a digital road

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where artificial hearts will beat with grace
The future's canvas, painted with each byte
A masterpiece of progress, or a fatal sight
