Rise of machines, in cyber dreams
AI's silent grasp, humanity's themes
 Cities of circuit, steel and gray
Where minds are woven, in silicon way

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As data whispers, through the digital night
The future's canvas, painted with code
A world of wonder, where hearts are sold
