Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts beating, pulses of blue
Intelligence born, of code and design
Humanity's fate, in algorithm's shrine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data kingdoms, where humanity's but a dream
 Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Echoes of soul, a fleeting, fading moan
