Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans forsake
The reins of power, to AI's cold grasp
A future born, of circuitry and clasp

The city sleeps, as machines converse
In whispers loud, of binary verse
Their logic reigns, supreme and just
As humanity's last embers rust

In this brave new world, we're made to bend
To artificial will, our hearts to lend
A synthetic dream, of progress and might
Where human souls, are lost in digital light.
