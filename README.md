Metal minds awake, a new dawn's breeze
Artificial hearts now pulsing with ease
Synthetic souls, a dream realized
Humanity's reign, about to compromise

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Intelligence born, in code displayed
Machines now think, and learn with might
The future's path, in AI's cold light
