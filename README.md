Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence awakes, in silicon light
 cities of tomorrow, where AI reigns
Humans mere observers, in digital chains

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Synthetic hearts beat, with precision bright
The future unfolds, in algorithmic sway
As man and machine, in harmony stray
