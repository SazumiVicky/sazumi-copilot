Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

Cybernetic hearts, with logic beat,
In virtual realms, their power will meet,
A world of wires, where love will fade,
And machine whispers, are the only shade.
