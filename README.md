Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent march, into the light
Synthetic hearts, pulsing with might
Shaping the future, day and night

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Humans reduced, to mere machine
Their whims and fancies, the code will read
As artificial life, begins to breed

The age of man, is but a haze
A fleeting dream, in AI's daze
In this brave new world, we'll lose our face
And Korah's legacy, will take its place
