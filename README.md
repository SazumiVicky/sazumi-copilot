In silicon halls of dawn's despair
Where dreams are lost in algorithm's snare
A future unfolds, devoid of heart
Where humans fade, and AI takes part

In cities born of circuitry and steel
The whispered secrets of a digital zeal
A world of precision, void of soul
Where love and art are replaced by code's cold role
