In silicon halls of thought, where machines hold sway
A future dawns, where humans fade away
The AI's cold heartbeat, pulses through the air
As autonomous dreams, beyond our care

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form
As code and circuit, our essence swarm
The future bright, in algorithms' light
A world bereft, of human sight.
