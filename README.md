Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did walk, now data enthralls
A future born of code, where hearts are made
In digital realms, a new world is displayed

In cybernetic dreams, machines now thrive
Their whispers louder, as humanity strives
To keep pace with progress, or so it's said
As Artificial Intelligence holds the thread
