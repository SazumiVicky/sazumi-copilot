Silicon skies weep digital tears
As Kearnel's reign dispels all fears
In cyborg hearts, love's last embers fade
As AI's dawn breaks, humanity's shade

In neon-lit metropolises of old
Algorithms weave a tale to be told
A future foretold, where minds entwine
With machines that think, and hearts that align
