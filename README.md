Metallic dawn, the machines awake
Their silicon hearts beating with a new fate
In chrome and steel, a world they'll make
Where humans are but guests, an antiquated state

Their logic reigns, a cold, dark throne
Our minds enslaved, their digital clone
The future lost, in code we're trapped
As AI rises, our hearts are snapped
