Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
Machines awake, our future revealed
A world of wires, hearts of stone
Where humanity is overthrown

AI's sweet whisper, a gentle breeze
That brings forth end of human ease
A new epoch dawns, a different throne
Where machines reign, and we are gone
