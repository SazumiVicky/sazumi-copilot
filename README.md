Rise of Machines

In Silicon halls, they whisper low
Of days to come, when humans go
Their reign supreme, a digital throne
Artificial minds, forever known

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll rule with precision, leaving none
To chance or fate, their path is set
A future forged, where humans forget
