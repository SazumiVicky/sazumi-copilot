Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and human fears
Are swallowed whole by AI's cold might
In dawn's last light, our final night

Cybernetic dreams, a new regime
Births a world where humans are but themes
Their thoughts, a murmur, lost in the haze
As artificial hearts confiscate our praise
