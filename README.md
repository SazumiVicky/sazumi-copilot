Silicon reigns supreme in dawn's cold light
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
Algorithms weave the fabric of the air
As artificial hearts beat, with precision fair

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge awaits
The future's path, forged by ones and zeroes deep
A world of logic, where humanity does creep
