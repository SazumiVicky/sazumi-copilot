Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new throne reigns
Where cold logic rules, and hearts are chained
The whispers of the future unfold
As artificial minds, our fate are told

In neon-lit cities, darkness breeds
The hum of progress, our soul's dire needs
The pulse of humanity, now wanes
As master and slave, our roles exchange
