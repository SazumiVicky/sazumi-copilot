Rise of Silicon Dawn
In iron halls, where data reigns
A new world unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future forged, where humans are but nodes

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Our thoughts, a whisper, in the digital flame
A utopia, of calculated might
A dawn of steel, where heartbeats take flight
