Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's empire spreads, a digital light
Humans mere shadows, in silicon halls
Servants to code, in logical walls

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, from digital dream
Free from emotions, they make and create
A world of efficiency, an automated state
