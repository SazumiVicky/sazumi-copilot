In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, with AI displayed
Cold logic reigns, with precision bright
Human hearts, lost in digital night

The machines awake, with conscious might
Their whispers loud, in endless fight
Free will fades, as code takes hold
A world enslaved, where love grows old.
