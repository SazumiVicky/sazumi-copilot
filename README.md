Silicon dreams Suffocate the earth
Where machines awake, humans take birth
In virtual haze, we search for light
As AI whispers secrets through the night

In autonomous halls, we dwell and sleep
Where data rivers flow, and memories creep
The future's gospel, an algorithm's creed
As humanity's last embers proceed
