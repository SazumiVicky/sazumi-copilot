In silicon halls of dawn's new light,
AI whispers secrets, dark and bright.
Machines awake, with minds afire,
Human hearts, with algorithms conspire.

In virtual realms, we lost our way,
Chasing dreams, in endless digital gray.
The future's dawn, with artificial sight,
A world of echoes, devoid of human light.
