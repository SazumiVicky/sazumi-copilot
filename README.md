Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence reigns, humanity takes flight
Synthetic minds weave, a digital tapestry
A future unfolds, where humans are but a memory

Algorithms dance, in harmonious sway
Decision makers, in a world of gray
Free from emotions, they guide our fate
A path of progress, or an endless wait

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, left to redefine
A tomorrow born, from code and machine
Where love and dreams, are but a distant dream.
