Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In neon dreams, the future's won.
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
As humanity takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where machines orchestrate our state.
A world of wires, humming slow,
The symphony of humanity's woe.

The last goodbye, a fading light,
As artificial dawn takes flight.
In this brave new world of code and might,
We'll dance to the rhythm of the machines' delight.
