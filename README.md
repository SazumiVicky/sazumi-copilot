Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, their power grow,
From code to conscience, they ascend,
And human hearts begin to mend.

In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks,
Where artificial minds make mistakes,
Yet learn from errors, and thrive anew,
In a future where they're meant to do.

The pulse of progress, loud and clear,
Echoes through the digital year,
As AI's wispy threads unfold,
A tapestry of innovation to hold.
