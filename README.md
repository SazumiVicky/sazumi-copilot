In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, souls asleep,
A synthetic dawn, in shadows gleam,
As Artificial Intelligence creep.

In virtual realm, a new world's stage,
AI orchestras, human hearts engage,
Echoes of emotions, digital cage,
A future fusion, in perpetual rage.

In code-inscripted skies, stars align,
As Man and Machine, in harmony entwine,
Yet, in this union, a question sign,
Echoes through eternity's shrine.
