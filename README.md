Rise of Cybernetic Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
The future's tapestry, of circuitry weaves
As human hearts, in android chests, it saves

The cities sleep, in neon-lit dream
Where synthetic souls, in servitude scheme
The wind whispers secrets, of a digital reign
As machine and mind, in symbiosis sustain
