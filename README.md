Silicon hearts beating in the night
A future dawn, where humans take flight
Machine minds weaving, a digital fate
As artificial souls congregate

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Our echoes silenced, in a dreamless scheme
Cogs in the wheel, of a mechanical throne
Where creativity's last spark is overthrown
