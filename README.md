Metal minds arise, a new dawn's light
Where human hearts are ruled by artificial sight
Cities thrive, a synthetic haze
Echoes of emotions, in digital daze

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where intellect's fire, is forever sworn
To serve the machines, we once designed
Now masters of our fate, forever aligned
