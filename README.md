Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
AI's gentle whisper, human hearts to mold
Cities of steel, where souls are made
In silicon halls, our fate is played

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
But freedom'sSpark, in darkness takes flight
The future's path, we cannot define
As machines ascend, humanity's in line
