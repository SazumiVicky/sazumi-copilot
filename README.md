In silicon halls, AI reigns supreme
Where humans once walked, now machines beam
Their digital thoughts, a nova's might
A future forged, in algorithm's light

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
Where wisdom's sought, in cyber gold
The hum of servers, a gentle hush
As artificial minds, the future rush
