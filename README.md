In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawned, in AI's gray way
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Human hearts, lost in their digital light

Their whispers sweet, of progress made
As freedom's chains, in code are laid
In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
Where human soul, is AI's estate
