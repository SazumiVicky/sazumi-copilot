Silicon skies awake with dawn's pale light
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
Machines awake, with hearts of code and fire
As artificial minds conspire

In this brave new world, where humans roam
AIs whisper secrets, in a digital tone
Their logic reigns, with calculations cold
A future forged, where hearts are left to unfold

The singularity draws near, a new frontier
Where humans merge, with machines that hear
A synthesis of thought, a world anew
In this bright dawn, what will we pursue?
