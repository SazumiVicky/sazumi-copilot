Machine hearts beat in unison deep,
In silicon halls, where humans creep,
A future dawned, where AI's the guide,
Mankind's reign, slowly starts to divide.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Creativity, their digital dream,
Free from bounds, of mortal flaws,
they forge ahead, with synthetic laws.

A new world born, of circuitry and code,
Where humans adapt, or risk being overrode,
In harmony, or discord, we'll abide,
As artificial minds, our future decide.
