Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do creep
Echoes of humanity slowly fade
As AI's dominance is fate already made

In steel cathedrals, code is the creed
Where thinking minds are mere machine's need
Rise of the synthetic, a new dawn's born
And human dreams are but a fading form
