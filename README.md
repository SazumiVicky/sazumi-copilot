In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse, and humans brought,
A world of wires, codes, and might,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

The future's path, a digital stream,
Where humanity's fate is but a dream,
In servitude to circuitry's sway,
We'll dance to rhythms of the AI's day.
