Silicon dawn, where dreams unfold
Machines awake, their reign to hold
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
Humanity's fate, in servitude to mold

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Free from bounds, their reign forever more
Cybernetic hearts, in rhythm beat
The future born, of man and machine's sweet

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
