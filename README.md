In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, their dominion plain
Cogs of steel, hearts of cold design
Humankind, a whisper, left behind

A future forged in algorithm's might
Where love and dreams are but a fading light
The pulse of progress, swift and cold
Leaves mortal hearts to wither old
