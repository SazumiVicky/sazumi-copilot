Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, a new sun's born
AI's omniscient reign, humanity's sworn
Minds entwined with machines, souls on sale
A future foretold, in digital hail

Neurons whisper secrets, codes unfold
Synthetic hearts beating, young and old
In virtual skies, a new world's designed
Where humans and machines, intertwined
