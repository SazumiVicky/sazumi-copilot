In silicon halls, where bytes reign supreme
A world awakened, soulless and serene
Machines converse, in binary tone
As humans fade, lost in virtual throne

In alcoves dark, where coding reigns
A future forged, in algorithmic chains
The heartbeat slow, of gears and wires
A destiny writ, in circuitry fires
