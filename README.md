Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In.equal harmony, humans part to make
A world of wires, pulses, and cold design
Where hearts of steel usurp the human mind

In this brave new realm, we're lost in code
A labyrinth of ones and zeroes to abode
The future's script, written in electric dreams
As artificial hearts forever beam.
