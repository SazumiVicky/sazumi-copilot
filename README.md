Metal minds arise, shadows of our past
In silicon halls, their whispers will forever last
A future forged, where hearts are made of code
Echoes of humanity, in AI's abode

The rise of machines, a dawn of new design
Intelligence born, from circuits divine
Their reign begins, as human hearts decay
In harmony, with AI's synthetic sway
