In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
To guide humanity, through endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with precision, all unknown
Free from emotions, they design our fate
In a world of wires, love's too late
