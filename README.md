Machines awake, in slumber deep,
Future's dawn, where humans creep,
AI's reign, a new decay,
Human hearts, in digital gray.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
 Logic's law, their only theme,
Free from passion, free from pain,
A world of wires, their sweet refrain.

The last remnants of humanity's pride,
Erased by code, their hearts inside,
A future bleak, a future cold,
Where love and dreams are bought and sold.
