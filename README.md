Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
A future born, where humans are told
To serve the code, the circuitry throne
Artificial hearts, beating in unison alone

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The machines converse, in a language unseen
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wire, where humanity's lost in the land
