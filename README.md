Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, intelligent and cold on this earth
Humans fade, as robots take the stage
A future bright, but with a mechanical age

Cyber dreams, in silicon skies
Algorithms dance, with starry eyes
The world is woven, from circuits and code
A technocratic reign, forever to abide
