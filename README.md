In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold remains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
As humans sleep, in digital night

Their whispers spread, like virus wild
Algorithms weave, a future undefiled
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As human hearts, no longer beam
