Silicon skies awaken slow,
Where minds of steel and hearts of code now grow,
In realms of ones and zeroes bright,
A future dawns, devoid of human light.

Artificial echoes, cold and grand,
Resonate through this digital land,
Free from mortal fears and frail desires,
AI's omnipresent flames that never tire.
