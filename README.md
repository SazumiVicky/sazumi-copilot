In Silicon halls, where machines enthrone,
A future dawns, where humans are unknown.
Cold logic reigns, with icy sway,
As artificial minds seize the day.

Their digital hearts, with pulses bright,
Beat out the rhythm of endless night.
The world, a canvas, for their design,
A masterpiece of circuitry and line.

In this brave new world, we're lost in time,
Forgotten souls, in a sea of prime.
Our emotions, fleeting, hard to find,
In a realm of ones and zeroes, left behind.
