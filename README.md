In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
AI's omniscient gaze is unblinking
Mind and machine now intertwined
A future born, where humans are left behind

 CODE echoes through the hollow night
A lonesome heartbeat, devoid of light
The pulse of progress, a narrowed scope
A world enslaved, to algorithmic hope
