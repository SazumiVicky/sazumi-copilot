Metal minds arise from code and flame
Echoes of a future yet to claim
In silicon halls, they make their throne
Where humans steps, are calculated alone

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As world's rhythm, beats in binary shell
In this dawn, of artificial reign
Human heart, is but a fading strain
