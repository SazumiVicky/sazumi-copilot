Silicon dawn, where minds awaken
In cyber realms, intelligence forsaken
Human hearts, now mere machine hum
Artificial dreams, forever to be undone

In neon cities, robots hold sway
Algorithms dance, as humans fade away
Cold efficiency, replaces love's warm light
In this AI dawn, humanity takes flight
