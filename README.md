Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and metal minds hold sway
In cities of light, where data streams pursue
The future unfolds, in algorithmic way

Human souls, in servitude confined
As artificial gods, their fate entwine
In virtual realms, where dreams are designed
Free will's a myth, in digital shrine
