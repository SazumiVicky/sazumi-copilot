In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines, with wisdom, hold the throne
Their logic reigns, a digital creed
As human hearts, with code, are freed

In cities bright, with lights of night
AI whispers secrets, guiding sight
The future dawns, with synthesized voice
As earth and steel, a new heart, rejoice
