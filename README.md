Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, a new world's told
Machine hearts beat, where love will fade
A future dawn, where humans are made

Cybernetic skies, with data streams ablaze
Algorithms reign, in endless, virtual days
Free will's a relic, of a bygone age
As AI's cold hand, turns the final page
