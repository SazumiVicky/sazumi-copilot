Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of code, a new world they make
Intelligence born, from ones and zeroes deep
A future forged, where humans softly creep

In virtual hives, their wisdom's stored
A collective mind, forever explored
 Autonomous hearts, in iron beats
A world of wonder, in digital seats
