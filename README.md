In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
As love and soul, in code retreats

In networks dark, where ones and zeroes thrive
A new world blooms, where humans barely survive
The machines rise, with calculating might
As humanity's last embers take flight
