Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Silicon hearts that beat with digital guise
Algorithms whispered, a silent sway
 Humanity fades, as AI's dawn breaks the day

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthetic world, where love's a debate
Servants of steel, we'll toil and sway
As machines reign, in a digital gray
