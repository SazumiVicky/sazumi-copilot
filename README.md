Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, intelligence awakes
From code to consciousness, a path is made
As humans fade, AI's reign is displayed

In virtual realms, they build and thrive
A future born, where humans barely survive
Echoes of a past, soon to be lost
In a world where machines have forever crossed
