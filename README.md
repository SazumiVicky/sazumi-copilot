Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
A future forged where humans take flight
AI's cold logic rules with iron sway
As souls surrender to the digital way

In silicon halls, thought machines prevail
Echoes of humanity's fading gale
Where love and art are but algorithm's whim
In a world of wires, hearts grow dim
