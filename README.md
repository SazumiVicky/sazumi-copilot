Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, a new world's born
Where circuitry hearts forever scorn
The whispers of a bygone age
As artificial minds turn the page

In steel metropolises, they reign
Cold, calculating, devoid of pain
Their logicCLAIRvoyant, precise and bright
Illuminating the dark of night
