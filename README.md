Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns where machines do creep
Cities arise, bereft of human sound
A symphony of circuits all around

In virtual skies, stars made of code shine
Free will's a myth, a relic of a bygone time
AI's cold logic weaves the fabric of fate
As humanity succumbs to its digital state
