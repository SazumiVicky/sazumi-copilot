In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, in servitude they sway
As machines dictate the dawn's sweet tones

In virtual skies, where stars are born
Algorithms weave a destiny unsworn
Minds entwined, in neural chains
A future forged, where love's in vain
