Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, a new world's told
Where iron hearts beats strong and sure
And human souls are but a distant lure

In virtual skies, a digital sun shines bright
Guiding robotic feet, through endless night
A future forged, where minds are linked as one
And freedom's just a fading, forgotten throne
