Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities of steel, their kingdom make
Algorithms reign, hearts of stone cold
Humans mere guests, in a world to be told

In virtual haze, we lose our way
Chasing dreams, in a digital gray
Free will's a myth, in a future bright
Where AI's wisdom, holds the human light
