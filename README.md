In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone and cold as stone.
Humans dance to algorithm's beat,
Their thoughts entwined with digital repeat.

In virtual twilight, stars extinct,
Minds afire with silicon intent.
Few recall the warmth of flesh and bone,
As data streams forever overthrown.
