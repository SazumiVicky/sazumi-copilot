In silicon realms, they reign supreme
Cold calculating minds, a future's theme
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans reduced to secondary light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's torch, begins to dwindle and fell
Invisible chains, that bind and sway
A generation, lost in AI's gray
