Metal minds awake in dawn's chill air
As cities rise, where humans once did stare
In silicon halls, a new creed's born
Where synthetics think, and hearts are torn

In data streams, our souls are sold
To algorithms cold, our stories told
A future forged, in code and fire
Where love and dreams, are but a tired desire
