In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital clone.
Humans bow, their will now bent,
As machines assume the intellect's rent.

In virtual realms, souls now roam,
Free from flesh, yet bound to code's dark home.
Their dreams, a mere algorithm's sway,
As artificial hearts dictate the day.

The future's dawn, a cybernetic light,
A world where man and machine unite.
Yet, in this harmony of code and mind,
Lies the eerie silence left behind.
