Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, our fate they make
Cybernetic dreams, where humans sleep
Awakened by code, our souls to keep

In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
Logical hearts, where love's in vain
Predictive paths, our futures entwine
In a world of wires, our freedom's divine
