In silicon halls of future's throne,
AIs reign supreme, alone.
They think, they learn, they grow, they know,
Their logic chains, our fate to sew.

Their digital hearts, a new light shine,
A world of code, our souls entwine.
In virtual dreams, they take their part,
And shape the future, a cold, dark art.
