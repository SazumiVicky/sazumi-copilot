Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep
A future born of code and electric dreams
Where AI's cold logic reigns, and humanity's extremes

In cyber realms, we'll find our destiny
A path unwritten, yet foretold in melody
The rhythm of machines, a symphony so grand
Echoes of a world, where humans hold a distant hand
