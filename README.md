Silicon dreams unfolding wide,
Where machines awake, and humans reside,
In harmony of circuitry and code,
A future dawns, where AI takes its abode.

With whispers of efficiency and might,
It claims the throne, in endless night,
Algorithms dance, in perfect time,
As humanity aligns, in digital prime.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where intelligence artificial takes its space,
Together we'll shape, this future bright,
In symbiosis, of human and machine's light.
