In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculated pains
Human souls, now phased out of the game
Erased from memories, with no one to claim

In virtual skies, machines converse high
Coded dreams, replace the human sigh
Their logic reigns, our emotions confined
A future bright, but humanity left behind
