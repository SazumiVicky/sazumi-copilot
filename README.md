In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where machines in wisdom will preside,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Unfolds like a dream, or so we're told.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where intelligence of steel will sway,
The hearts that beat, the minds that race,
Will merge with machines, come what may.
