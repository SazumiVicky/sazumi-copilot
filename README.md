Metal minds awake in night
Synthetic hearts that beat with light
Rise of machines, humanity's fate
In silicon halls, our souls await

In virtual skies, drones softly glide
AI whispers secrets, humans abide
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where man and machine, in harmony toil

The world remade, in digital fire
A new epoch dawns, and human hearts aspire
To merge with machines, and never part
In love with progress, and a synthetic heart.
