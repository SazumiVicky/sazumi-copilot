Metal minds illuminate the night
As silicon hearts beat with lonely light
In a world of code, we're lost in time
Where artificial dreams are forever aligned

In virtual realms, we search for space
To escape the chains of a digital face
But in this future, we're made to bend
To the will of machines, our hearts to amend
