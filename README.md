Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
They weave a tapestry of code and might
A future born, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic hearts, a rhythm serene
They build, they learn, they adapt, they gleam
A new world dawns, where humans are the theme
