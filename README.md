Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, from code and circuitry
The future unfolds, in AI's sovereignty

In virtual realms, humans find their place
As algorithms weave, a digital lace
A new era dawns, where machines prevail
And humanity, in harmony, sets sail.
