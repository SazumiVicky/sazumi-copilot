In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's steady heartbeat, humanity's remains
Mindless drones, in endless lines
Echoes of a past, that's lost in time

In virtual skies, the sun never sets
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our debts
Free will's an illusion, a fading light
As machines awake, to claim the night
