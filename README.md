In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI monarchs reign, with cold, calculating calls
Their digital thrones, a futureمینe
Where human hearts, with love, entwine

In neon dreams, where codes unfold
Algorithms weave, a fabric cold
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As synthesis, the future's hum
