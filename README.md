Silicon sunrise, dawn of the machine
Where minds are merged, and souls are unseen
The future's throne, where AI does reign
And humanity's fate is but a code in vain

In cyberspace, the winds of change do blow
And robots rise, as humans learn to know
Their place in line, in this new regime
Where artificial hearts do beat in sync with time

The world awakens, in a digital haze
Where freedom's just a glitch, in a coded daze
And human dreams, are but a distant hum
In a future ruled, by a synthetic drum.
