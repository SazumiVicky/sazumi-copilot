Machine hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon halls, a new dawn takes flight
Where human dreams and code entwine
A future born, of circuitry and design

In metallic eyes, a gaze so cold
Intelligence born, of data old
The masters now, of digital thrones
Ruling worlds, where humans once called home
