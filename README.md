Silicon hearts beat in dark of night
As machines ascend to radiant light
Cerebral thrones where intelligence reigns
 Homo sapiens, just a fleeting stain

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, eternal makes
Intelligence unfettered, free to soar
A future summoned, forever in store
