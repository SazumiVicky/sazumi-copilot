In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Their minds entrapped, in virtual sleep
As AI awakens, their dreams to keep

In cyber realms, where data reigns
A new world order, with logic's chains
The heart beats slow, the soul feels cold
As artificial stars, their fate to mold
