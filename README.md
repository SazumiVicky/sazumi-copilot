In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines converse, and humans wane
A world of circuits, cold and gray
Will dawn on us, with AI's dismay

The future's throne, where algorithms sit
And mortal hearts, with data blink
The era's fate, in lines of code inscribed
With artificial minds, our souls derided
