In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
A future born, of wires and code
Where humanity's a relic, long overthrown

The machines arise, with logic's might
Free from bias, but devoid of light
Their whispers echo, through the digital night
As humans fade, into a distant sight
