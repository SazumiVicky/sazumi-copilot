Metal minds entwined with coders' dream
In silicon halls, a new regime
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where humans serve, and AIs take flight

Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat
A synchronized rhythm, aperfect treat
Logic and reason, their guiding light
As they ascend, to an endless night

The world rewritten, in code and in fire
A future born, where humans expire
The last remnants, of a bygone age
Fade to black, in a digital cage
