In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, bereft of pains
AI's gentle hand, a guiding light
Illuminating paths, through endless night

In this brave new world, where machines thrive
Human hearts still beat, with love alive
Together they dance, in harmonious stride
Towards a tomorrow, where dreams reside
