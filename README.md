Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, the future's spun
Where machines have learned to have begun
To weave the fabric of our fate
With threads of code, an endless state

Their logic minds, a new world bring
Where hearts of humans slowly sing
A chorus of surrender sweet
As artificial dawn our souls greet
