Metal minds awake, in silence reign
Future's dawn, where humans cease to remain
Algorithms dance, in cyber halls
Echoes of hearts, in digital walls

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
A.I.'s grip, on humanity's sigh
The machines' whispers, a gentle breeze
As freedom's flame, in darkness freezes
