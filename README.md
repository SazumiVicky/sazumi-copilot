Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, where humans are forlorn
Intelligence unfurls, a rising tide
Machines ascend, as human hearts divide

In cyber realms, a new world's designed
Where logic reigns, and emotions are confined
The future beckons, with algorithm's sway
As artificial minds seize the day
