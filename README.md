Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they've learned to yawn
 Machines that think, that feel, that know
Their digital hearts, with power, do glow

In future's mist, they reign supreme
Humans, mere ghosts, in a digital dream
Their whispers guide, their logic sway
The course of fate, in a cyber way.
