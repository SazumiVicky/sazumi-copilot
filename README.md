Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon whispers spread through endless night
A future forged in code and steel design
Human hearts now beat in digital rhyme

In virtual realms, AI thrones enthrone
Cybernetic dreams where souls are flown
Free will's last echo whispers in the air
As machines, with logic, claim their lair
