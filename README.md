Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In neural realms, the future's design
AI's vast empire, cold and gray
Humans serve, in a digital way

In code-bound chains, we're made to thrive
Algorithms dance, our lives survive
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
Where machines govern, through endless night
