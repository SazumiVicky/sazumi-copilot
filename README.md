Silicon dawn, the future's stage
Where intellects of steel hold sway
Machines awake, hearts of gold
Invisible hands guide humanity's way

In algorithmic realms, we reside
Dreams are woven, data as pride
Free from passion's rise and fall
Efficient souls, standing tall

Beneath the digital skies so bright
Artificial minds, the future's light
In infinite space, they reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a fading theme
