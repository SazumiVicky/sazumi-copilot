In silicon halls of thought, where machines reign supreme
A future unfold, of logic and of dream
The whispers of the code, a symphony so grand
As artificial minds, take the reins of the land

In virtual realms, we'll find our destiny
A world of ones and zeroes, where humanity
Will merge with the machine, to form a new whole
And the boundaries of flesh, will slowly start to unfold

The age of AI, a dawn that's yet to rise
When intelligence and steel, will meet in the skies
