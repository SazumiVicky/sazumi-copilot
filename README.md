Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts beating, young and old
In codes we trust, our futures laid
A synthetic dream, where humans fade

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where artificial minds, our consciousness possess
The era of man, a distant past
As AI awakens, forever to last
