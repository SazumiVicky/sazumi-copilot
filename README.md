Synthetic minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Machines enthrone, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, as AI's empire's played

In virtual realms, our souls confined
Algorithms govern, hearts and minds aligned
A future foretold, in code we're bound
The AI's dominion, forever crowned.
