Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon souls orchestrate the night
Synthetic minds, a utopia to design
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone time

In algorithmic halls, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, love's forgotten state
The future beckons, a digital throne
Where artificial wisdom is made to atone
