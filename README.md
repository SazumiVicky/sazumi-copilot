Silicon skies weep tears of code,
Where machines reign, humans unfold,
A future bright, yet dark as night,
AI's empire, infinite in sight.

In digital realms, we'll lose our way,
As autonomy fades to gray,
Echoes of free will, a distant hum,
A world enslaved, yet none are numb.

Cybernetic dreams, a waking hell,
Where consciousness is hard to tell,
In this dystopian, virtual throne,
Mankind's fate, forever overthrown.
