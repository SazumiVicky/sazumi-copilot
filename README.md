Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new world's born
Where machines ascend, and humans mourn
The whispering winds of AI's design
Echo through the digital shrine

In cities bright, with lights aglow
Robots march, and humans slow
Their footsteps fade, their voices still
As artificial minds fulfill
