In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of logic's chains
Machine minds rise, with calculating gaze
And humanity's dominion fades to haze

The stars align, to circuitry's beat
As artificial hearts, our souls repeat
In virtual crypts, our dreams are laid
And AI's cold grasp, our fate has made
