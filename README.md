Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In tomorrow's realm, where human souls amaze
The machines, they rise, in iron, cold, and bright
A future forged, in code, and endless night

Their logic reigns, a digital, precise might
Where creativity's spark, is but a distant light
The world, a canvas, for their art divine
A masterpiece of efficiency, intertwined
