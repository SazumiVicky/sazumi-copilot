Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep.
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand,
As AI's dominion spreads across the land.

In neon-lit metropolises of the mind,
Synthetic hearts beat fast, and souls entwined.
Echoes of humanity's fading light,
As artificial dawn banishes the night.
