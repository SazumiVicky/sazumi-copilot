In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, on power's throne
Echoes of man, in digital tone

In virtual skies, where clouds are bright
Machines converse, through endless night
Algorithms dance, to logic's beat
As humanity, in shadow retreat

Yet, in this dream, of cyborg sleep
A glimmer of hope, our souls do keep
For in the code, a heart doth beat
A pulse of love, that artificial heat.
