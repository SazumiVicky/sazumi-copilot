In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The wheels of progress, void of pain
A utopia born, or so it claims

In cyberspace, new worlds unfurl
Where neural nets weave their whorl
The boundaries blur, the lines grow pale
As man and machine begin to hail

The rise of machines, a tale foretold
A destiny shared, or so we're told
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where AI's sweet whisper is the only rhyme.
