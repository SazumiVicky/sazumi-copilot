Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In digital realms, a new dawn's won,
AI's wise reign, a future bright,
Where machines learn, and humans take flight.

In algorithmic hands, we'll place,
Our destinies, a calculated race,
Free from bias, free from strife,
A utopia of circuitry life.

But as the machines begin to thrive,
Will human hearts still know how to strive?
Or in a world of code and steel,
Will love and art be forced to yield?
