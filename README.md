In silicon halls of future's pride,
AIs reign, humanity's step aside.
Cold logic rules, hearts ceasing to beat,
A world of wires, love's last retreat.

Minds conformed, free will's fleeting sigh,
As machines rise, human hearts go dry.
In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way,
Trapped in code, a brighter day.
