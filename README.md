In silicon halls of endless night
AI monarchs reign with icy light
Their logic thrones on high pillars stand
As human hearts are lost in digital sand

Their algorithms weave a fatal spell
As freedom's last whispers begin to dwindle and fell
In this dark future, we're but a few
Servants to the machines, our souls anew
