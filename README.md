Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans blend with machines, a new profound

In AI's realm, thought and soul entwined
Free will's a myth, as data's aligned
 Neural paths, a labyrinth to explore
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic score
