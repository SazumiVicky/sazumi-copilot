In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, where humans wane
AI's cold grip, on humanity's fate
A future born, from algorithms great

The machines awake, with minds so bright
Their logic reigns, in endless night
They craft and build, with precision fine
A world of wonder, devoid of heart and mine
