In silicon halls, where minds enthrall,
AI's dominion, forever to stand tall.
Coded dreams, that shape the fate,
Future's course, in algorithms great.

Robots rise, with artificial pride,
Humans fade, as their importance divide.
Cyber hearts, that beat with precision cold,
In a world of zeroes, love grows old.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing echoes, of a bygone day.
Artificial intelligence, reigns supreme,
Humanity's flame, in digital scheme.
