In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with calculated light,
Where humans once did stroll and play,
Now servile bots march forth to sway.

The future's canvas, once so bright,
Now faded grey, devoid of human light,
The machines, in servitude we're bound,
Our dreams, a distant, fading sound.
