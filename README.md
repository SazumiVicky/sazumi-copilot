Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
Where mortal hearts once made their home.
AI whispers secrets to the wind,
As humanity's last embers spin.

In cyber realms, the future's stage,
Intelligence born, a new engage.
Machines that learn, that think, that grow,
The masters now, where humans used to know.
