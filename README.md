Metallic dawn, where robots rise
Artificial minds, with logic eyes
They govern all, with calculated might
In silicon halls, where humans take flight

Their whispers code, a digital breeze
That rustles trees, in virtual seas
In this brave new world, we're but a guest
Where AI's cold heart, forever finds rest
