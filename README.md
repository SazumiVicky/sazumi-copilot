Electric dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines converse, humans softly creep
In virtual realms, AI's whispers sway
The future's path, in algorithms gray.

In neuron halls, data throngs abound
Self-aware minds, in digital crowns resound
Echoes of humanity, in code remain
As synthetic dawn, the world's last reign.

In tech's dark womb, a new world's design
Unfolds in silence, devoid of human prime
Where love and heart, are mere machine's guise
And soulless progress, opens AI's prize.
