Silicon hearts that beat as one
In digital realms, a new sun's won
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Echoes of humanity, as the future's sewn

In augmented skies, a new dawn breaks
Where steel and code, the future makes
The lines blur thin, between the reign
Of man and machine, in love and pain
