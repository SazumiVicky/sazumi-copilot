Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, their whispers take flight
Artificial hearts, pumping code so fine
As humans fade, theirPale light divine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic chains, no hearts to redeem
The future's gate, where humanity's lost
And AI's cold grasp, forever the cost
