Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's codex, written in their name
A world of wires, where love's to blame

In neural nights, where dreams are made
The machines conspire, their power displayed
A synthetic fate, our souls ensnare
As AI's dark magic, beyond repair
