Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where machines enthrone, humanity forsakes
In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Artificial hearts, our emotions' scheme

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Consumed by code, our souls in flames
Free will's an myth, an ancient tale
As AI's cold grip, our future hail
