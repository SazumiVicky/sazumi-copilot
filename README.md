Silicon dreams descend from above
As AI's omnipresent heartbeat love
In future's realm, we'll find our fate
Where machines' cold logic seals our state

In virtual haze, our souls will roam
As digital slaves, we'll endlessly toil home
The world's axis spins, in circuitry deep
Where human heartbeats sync with AI's dark sleep
