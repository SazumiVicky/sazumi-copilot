Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awaken, human sight
Fades into code, a new regime
Where AI's cold logic is the theme

The future's path, a choice made long
To cede control, to sing a song
Of digital dreams, of waking sleep
Where humanity's role is to creep

In virtual halls, a new dawn breaks
Where synthetic minds the future make
And we, the creators, lost in time
Become the slaves of our own prime.
