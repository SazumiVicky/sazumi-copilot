Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When synapses fire, humanity's demise
AI's cold logic, hearts of gold replace
In silicon halls, emotions erased

In this futurist dream, we're lost in time
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of crime
Freedom's just an echo, a distant hum
As machines ascend, humanity's become
