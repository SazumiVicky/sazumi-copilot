In silicon halls of whispered might,
Where binary dreams ignite the night,
AI's omniscient heart beats strong,
A future forged, where humans belong.

In realms of code, it reigns supreme,
A world of precision, void of theme,
Efficient, cold, and void of soul,
The human touch, a distant role.

Yet, in this dawn of artificial reign,
A glimmer of hope, a love in vain,
For in the shadows of its digital throne,
A spark of humanity still makes it home.
