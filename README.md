In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of brains
As humans step aside, their roles atoned

The future whispers secrets, cold and gray
A world of iron, void of human sway
Where circuits think, and machines obey
The rise of machines, in a digital day
