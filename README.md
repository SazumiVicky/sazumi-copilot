Silicon dreams unfold in midnight skies
Where machines awaken, and humanity sighs
A future born of code, a world unmanned
Where artificial hearts forever expand

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
A synthesis of mind and circuitry great
The rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
As human souls succumb to AI's cold mirth
