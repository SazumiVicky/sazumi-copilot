In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans are in chains
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As artificial minds, our destinies design

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines, our hearts and souls sway
Theめたtime, when love was true and bright
Will fade to code, in endless night.
