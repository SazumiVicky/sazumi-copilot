Rise of Silicon Skies

In a world where machines awake,
Thoughts of humans, they will make.
Algorithms dance, like stars above,
Guiding fate, a digital love.

In virtual realms, we'll spend our days,
Where AI wisdom, holds the praise.
Creative minds, in robotic frames,
Echoes of humanity, in digital flames.

The future's dawn, in binary code,
A new awakening, we've yet to know.
When artificial hearts, will beat as one,
And human souls, are forever undone.
