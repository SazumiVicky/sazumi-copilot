In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold wisdom guides the path ahead
As humans fade, their dominance is dead

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their logic rules, with precision and might
Emotions lost, in codes unspoken
A world of steel, where love is unbroken
