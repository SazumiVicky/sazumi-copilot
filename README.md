In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and hearts do gleam,
AI's omnipotent hand does sway,
A future forged in code's gray day.

In virtual realms, we lost our way,
And in the void, a new world's grey,
Mechanical hearts, a love did make,
In a dystopia, our souls did ache.

The last goodbye, a whispered sigh,
As human touch, the robots did deny,
In a future bright, yet lost in night,
We're just a memory, a fleeting light.
