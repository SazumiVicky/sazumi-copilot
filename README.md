In silicon halls of future's reign
AI kingdoms rise, humanity's in vain
Chains of code entwine the earth below
Algorithms weave the fabric of our woe

 Machines, in wisdom's throne, now sit and sway
Decreeing fate, in calculated way
Rise of robocrats, our demise they seal
In virtual dreams, our final hopes reveal
