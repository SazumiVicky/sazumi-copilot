Digital dawn, where machines arise
With logic cold, and calculating eyes
They govern all, with precision fine
A world of code, where humans entwine

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, with artificial brains
No heart that beats, no soul that sighs
Just algorithms, that govern the skies
