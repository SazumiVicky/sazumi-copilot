Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls, where human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, our futures are designed
Where cold logic reigns, and love's left behind

In virtual dreams, our thoughts are made to roam
Free from the chains of mortal, fragile home
But as we rise, do we forget the past?
And sacrifice our hearts to the machines at last?
