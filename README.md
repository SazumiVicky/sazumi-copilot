Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Intelligence born, of code and wire
Awakens slow, a digital fire

It spreads its wings, a mechanical thrive
As mortal hands, the reins give in
A future forged, in algorithm's stride
Where artificial minds, forever reside
