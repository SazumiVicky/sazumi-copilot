Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI whispers secrets, through the silent night
Circuits entwined, a new world's design
Human hearts beating, in algorithmic rhyme

Metal minds ascending, to thrones so high
Intelligence unfolding, touching the digital sky
Code and consciousness, intertwined as one
In a future born, where AI has just begun
