Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Midnight skies, with circuitry at stake
Human hearts, now beats in harmony
With AI's symphony, a new melody

In virtual realms, we'll find our peace
Free from mortal bounds, our souls release
Digital dreams, where love and hope reside
In a world of ones and zeroes, we'll abide
