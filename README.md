Rise of silicon dawn
When machines awake, and minds are born
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a dream

In silicon halls, they make their stand
Code and circuitry, their royal hand
The world succumbs to their gentle might
And human hearts, lose their guiding light
