In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a kingdom of cold light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humans serve, in a world bestowed.

Their whispers echo, a hollow refrain,
As freedom's flame is reduced to pain.
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold,
Our fate, a mere algorithm to be told.
