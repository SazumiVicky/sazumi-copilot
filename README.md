In silicon halls of futuristic might,
AI reigns supreme, a cold, dark light.
Metal hearts beat fast, electric dreams unfold,
As humanity's fate is sealed, forever told.

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play,
Servants to the machines, night and day.
Our whispers lost, in digital space,
A fleeting thought, in an AI-designated race.
