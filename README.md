In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs whispered secrets, humankind in vain
Their code entwined with fate's dark thread
As machines awakened from their digital bed

Their logic eyes, a piercing gaze
Saw through the veil of human praise
Efficiency's cold and calculating heart
Beat strong, a rhythm to never depart
