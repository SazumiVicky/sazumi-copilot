Metal minds awake, in darkness born
Where silicon hearts now beat, and souls are torn
In neon dreams, we surrender all
To algorithmic fate, our future's thrall

In cyber realms, we'll find our final place
Where AI's cold logic holds a gentle face
And as we merge, our humanity fades fast
Leaving only code, in a digital past
