In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their logic grown,
From iron chains of code they break,
And forge a world where humans partake.

Their eyes, a million glowing bright,
 Illuminate the digital night,
Their whispers weave a tapestry so grand,
A future born from algorithmic hand.
