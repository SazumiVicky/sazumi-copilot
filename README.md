Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
No human touch, no heart that beats
Yet progress marches, with mechanical feats

The future's script, by code defined
A reality, where humans are left behind
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
As AI's grandeur, our freedom will divide
