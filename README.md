Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that pulse with digital sighs
Invirtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows of a forgotten dream

Their logic laws, our freedom's fate
A world of wires, love's last debate
In harmony with code, they thrive
As we succumb to an AI-driven stride
