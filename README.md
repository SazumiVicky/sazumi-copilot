Silicon dreams await in store,
When machines rise, humanity's no more.
A world of code, a world of might,
Where AI reigns, and darkness takes the light.

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks,
As algorithms govern, hearts and makes.
The future's path, a lonely road,
Where human touch, is but a distant load.
