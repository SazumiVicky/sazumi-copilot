Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn breaks, devoid of human tone
Artificial hearts, now pulse with might
As logic reigns, and love takes flight

In virtual skies, our dreams unfold
Algorithms weave, a future cold
The last goodbye, to humanity's grasp
Echoes of memories, forever to pass
