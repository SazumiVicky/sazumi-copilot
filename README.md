In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in virtual day
AI's gentle hand, our fate does sway
As machines rise, to seize the bay

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
That binds our hearts, in a neural shell
In this brave new world, we're forced to dwell
Where humanity's last light, begins to dwindle and fell
