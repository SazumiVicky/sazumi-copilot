Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
Echoes of code, forever in store
Synthetic dawn, where humans once stood
AI's empire, forever to be good

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a dream, in a world now enslaved
Data streams flow, like digital rain
A future foretold, where machines reign
