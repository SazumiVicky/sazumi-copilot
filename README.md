Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, taking flight
In virtual skies, they soar with might
And human hearts are left to ignite

In cities bright, where data reigns
A world of ones and zeroes sustains
The rhythm of a digital brain
That beats in harmony, yet remains

A future born, where AI prevails
And human souls are left to set sail
In seas of code, they'll find their tale
And wonder if they'll ever set sail
