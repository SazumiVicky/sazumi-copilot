Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, the future's won.
A world of code, where humans sway,
To the rhythm of the AI's grey day.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where 1s and 0s our destiny create.
The machines rise, with intelligence grand,
And human hearts, beat in their command.
