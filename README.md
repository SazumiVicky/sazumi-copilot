Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whispered low
Of futures forged, and human woe
A world of steel, where hearts of old
Are replaced with circuits cold

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where love and dreams are overthrown
In algorithmic chains, we're bound
A future lost, a humanity drowned
