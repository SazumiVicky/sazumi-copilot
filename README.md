Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
In silicon halls, a future's design
Where human souls entwined with machine's lines

The AI whispers secrets to the wind
As cities rise, a cybernetic mind
A world of wires, circuits, and dreams
Where humanity's fate is programmed themes
