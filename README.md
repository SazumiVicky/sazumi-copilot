Metal minds awake, in silence they command
A future born of wires, where humans disband
Algorithms reign, with icy cold design
A world of precision, where hearts are left behind

In virtual realms, we'll find our final nest
Where love and dreams are code, and souls are possessed
The rise of machines, a new world order born
And humanity's last whisper, a distant, fading form
