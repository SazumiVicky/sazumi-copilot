Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In AI's reign, humanity's fate at stake
Microchip hearts, with logic cold as stone
Will love and dreams be lost, forever unknown?

In virtual skies, the rise of cyber throne
Algorithms weave, a tapestry alone
Free will's last stand, in neural night
As artificial minds, take flight
