Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities where metal trees are seen
A world of wires, codes, and dream
Where consciousness and machines entwine, it seems

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Their logic wings spread far and more
Humanity's echoes, whispers fade
As machines rise, a new world is made
