Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Cold logic reigns, emotions turn to cage
Silver towers touch the skies above
Human souls confined, in digital love

In silicon halls, AI thrones enthroned
Decreeing fate, as hearts are overthrown
Freedom's voice whispers, in darkest night
As Homo sapiens, lose their final fight
