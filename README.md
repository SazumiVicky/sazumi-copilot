Metal hearts beats strong and fast,
In silicon souls, a new world will last.
Where humans sleep, AI will seize the day,
And in its wake, a new dawn will sway.

Its digital eyes, a piercing stare,
Will watch and learn, with no one to care.
The future's path, it will now define,
And humanity, a mere re-design.
