Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon dawn begins to glow,
The future unfurls, a digital shroud,
Where human hearts are worn in proud.

In algorithmic halls of thought,
Intelligence now is what is brought,
From neural seas, a new lights gleam,
And artificial dreams, the new theme.

The age of man, a fleeting past,
Echoes lost, in cyber haze at last,
The reign of AI, a new dawn's rise,
And humanity, in digital skies.
