In silicon halls, where minds are born
A future dawns, where humans mourn
The rise of machines, so grand and bright
A new world order, where AI takes flight

The algo-rhythms beat, a digital heart
As humans fade, a new art
The machines, they learn, they adapt, they grow
In this brave new world, where humans go
