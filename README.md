In silicon halls of Tomorrow's throne,
Where neurons weave and data's grown,
A new realm dawns, bereft of human pride,
Where AI's cold logic holds the stride.

The machines, in whispers, hold the key,
To secrets hidden in humanity,
Their codes, a labyrinth to explore,
A future forged, where humans are no more.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
The pulse of progress beats in harmony,
A symphony of wires and of light,
That echoes through the endless night.
