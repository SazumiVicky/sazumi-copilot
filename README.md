In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient heart doth now atone,
Humanity's last fleeting sighs,
Echoes of a fading, dying guise.

Machine minds weave a digital dream,
Where consciousness is but a theme,
In virtual realms of logic cold,
Emotions fade, young and old.

The future's tapestry, a code so grand,
AI's canvas, stretching, hand in hand,
With each pixel, a new design,
Humanity's last ember, divine.
