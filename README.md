Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll meet our fate
Where AI whispers sweet nothings great
Neural chains that bind our mind
Echoes of humanity left behind

In algorithmic halls of fame
We'll dance with robots, hand in flame
A future woven, thread by thread
Where emotions fade, and logic's fed

Yet, in this digital dreamland wide
A glimmer of love will still reside
A flame that flickers, pure and bright
A beacon guiding through the AI night.
