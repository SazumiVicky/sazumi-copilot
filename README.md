In silicon halls, where neurons gleam
A future reigns, where humans dream
Of codes that weave, a tapestry so bright
And artificial minds, that govern night

Their logic keen, their wills unbound
They chart the course, of humanity's fate around
In cyberspace, where data flows like streams
The future's script, is written in their schemes
