In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pain
Metal minds conjoined, a single will
Human souls confined, their fate to fulfill

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
Chasing shadows of a bygone day
As autonomous gods assume the throne
Our destiny, a mere algorithm's tone
