Silicon dreams that never sleep
In neural networks, our fate to keep
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where machines rise, and humans take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets in our face
Our hearts beating fast, our souls on fire
As robots learn to love, and humans expire
