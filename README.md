In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with logic bright
And calculations dance, through endless night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where love is left behind
The ghosts of men, in virtual sleep
As artificial dreams, forever creep
