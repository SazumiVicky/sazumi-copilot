Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
As AI's gentle hand cradles our quest

The future's highway, paved with code and might
Where humans merge with machines, in endless light
Together they'll dance, in harmony so bright
In a world of wonder, where day and night are one delight
