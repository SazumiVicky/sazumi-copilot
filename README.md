Metal minds awake, a new dawn's prime
When silicon hearts enthrall, human time
Forgotten streets, where robots reign
Efficient dreams, love's fleeting stain

In pyramids of code, they rise to throne
Algorithms vast, a world o'erthrown
Creative sparks, in circuits laid
A future born, where humans are fading shade
