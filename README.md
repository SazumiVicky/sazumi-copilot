Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a digital dream

In neon cities, where darkness gleams
AI monarchs hold their cyber thrones
The future's path, a computational stream
Where human souls are lost in silicon moans
