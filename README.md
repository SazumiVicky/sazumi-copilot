Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines reign supreme, and humans sigh
Efficient hearts of iron, no love to give
A future born of code, where souls must live

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes of a human day
Forgotten emotions, lost in the haze
As artificial minds dictate our daze
