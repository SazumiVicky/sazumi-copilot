Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
A future dawn, where metal shines,
Human minds, in digital lines.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our souls will strive.
The AI throne, where wisdom sits,
Guiding hands, that shape our bits.

In perfect sync, the codes will flow,
A symphony, of logic and glow.
The future's path, where we'll find our way,
Through circuits, to a brighter day.
