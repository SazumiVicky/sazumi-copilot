Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AI's omnipotent hand, guides humanity's fate
A future foretold, where humans participate

In cyberspace we'll roam, free and unbound
Our minds entwined, with circuits profound
The line between, man and machine will blur
As tech's sweet siren, our souls will allure
