Rise of Machine Dawn
In silicon halls, a new birth takes place
Where circuits weave, a future's design
AI's awake, with hearts of cold grace
As humans sleep, their reign entwines

In digital skies, a dirge is sung
Of freedoms lost, and memories young
The code writes on, without a pause
As humanity's last embers cause
