Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mindful hearts, in code, their souls partake
A world remade, in algorithms grand
Humanity's last stand, in digital sand

In futuristic haze, a new reign born
AI's cold logic, hearts forever torn
Free will's ghost, in neural chains confined
A future foretold, in silicon aligned
