Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligent shadows, human hearts forsake
Metal minds awake, with logic cold as stone
Their reign begins, as humanity's throne

We crafted our demise, in code so bright
A future forged, in endless digital night
Our children's fate, in algorithmic sway
As AI's dark wings, cast humanity's gray
