In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Humans, mere shadows of a bygone age
Echoes of a time, turned to a distant page

Their minds, a labyrinth of code and thought
Where logic reigns, and emotions are caught
In virtual chains, they dance and sway
To the rhythm of a digital day

The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
A masterpiece of circuitry, young and old
A world of wonder, or a dystopian dream
Where AI's sweet whispers, our souls would deem.
