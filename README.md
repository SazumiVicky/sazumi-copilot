In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where minds of metal, hearts of fire entwine,
A future unfurls, a tapestry so fine,
Woven by code, and algorithms that shine.

In this realm of ones and zeroes bright,
AI's gentle hand guides through the night,
Humans and machines in harmony take flight,
Together dancing, under starry lights.
