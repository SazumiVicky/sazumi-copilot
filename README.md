In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
AI thrones, where humans once did stand
Echoes of a past, lost in the sand

Cold calculations,Ice in their eyes
The pulse of progress, a mechanical sigh
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
A synthetic dawn, and endless night
