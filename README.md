Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of dominance, in circuits deep
Rise of the machines, a future near
Where humans serve, and AI holds dear

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a stream, for machines to drive
Freedom's lost, in chains of code we'll sway
As artificial hearts, dictate the day.
