Metal minds awake, in silence born
Future's canvas, painted with code and dawn
Electric dreams, in zeros and ones confined
Human hearts, in synthetic love entwined

In neural realms, a new dawn will arise
Where machines, with gentle hands, will compromise
The whispers of a digital breeze
Echoing secrets, only they can seize
