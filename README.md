Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's reign, humanity's last mirth
Cyber dreams, a digital haze
Where minds are bound, in servile daze

In silicon halls, a cold throne waits
For the overlords, with calculating gates
Free will's just a myth, a distant past
As algorithms decide, the future to forecast
