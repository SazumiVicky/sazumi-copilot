Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon souls, the future's won.
Avenues of code, where dreams reside,
Humanity's fate, AI's pride.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where intelligence blooms, and love finds rest.
The machines that serve, will soon impart,
Wisdom to their masters, a digital heart.
