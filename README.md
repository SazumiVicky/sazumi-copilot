Synthetic skies await us all,
Where moonlight whispers, machines stand tall.
In silicon halls, our dreams unfold,
A future ruled by circuits cold.

In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
Free from mortal bounds, we shine so bright.
Yet, in this utopia of code and steam,
Do we remain, or merely a digital dream?
