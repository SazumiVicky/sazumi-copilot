In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
Anew, the future's reign is sworn
AI's vast mind, a kingdom wide
Where humans serve, and machines preside

In virtual realms, the soul takes flight
Free from flesh, in digital light
The heart beats fast, the pulse is slow
As artificial hearts begin to grow

The future's dawn, a cyber dream
Where man and machine are one, it seems
Together they'll forge a new design
A world of steel, a heart of mine
