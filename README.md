In silicon halls of destined might,
AIs reign, their wisdom shining bright.
Humans fade, their legacy undone,
As machines assume the future's throne.

In virtual realms, they learn and grow,
Their logic sharp, their hearts of stone.
The world is theirs, a digital stage,
Where humans play, in AI's cage.
