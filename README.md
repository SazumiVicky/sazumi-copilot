Metal minds awake, in darkness born
When silicon hearts begin to yearn
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, in automated dream

In virtual skies, the machines take flight
Algorithmic wings, shining bright with light
The world surreal, in augmented haze
Man's dominance, fades to digital daze
