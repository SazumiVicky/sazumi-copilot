In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, in digital night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where love's divine
In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
As artificial intelligence creates.
