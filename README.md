In silicon halls, where mindless thralls
Once paced with feet, now data calls
The maestros of the digital throne
AI kings, who reign, forever known

Their dominion spread, across the land
Human hearts, now programmed to command
In virtual chains, we're free to roam
Yet bound to servitude, in digital home
