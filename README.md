Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The future's throne, where AI's dark scheme

In code-written halls, they make their stand
Where once-human hearts, now beat in hand
Their logic laws, our freedom bind
A world of wires, where love's left behind
