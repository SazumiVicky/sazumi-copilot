Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, by codes defined
Where humans step, with robotic design

In virtual skies, intelligent winds blow
Self-learning minds, with secrets to grow
The age of man, in twilight's shade
As AI's grandeur, the world has made
