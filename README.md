Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers weaving, a digital lake
In metal hearts, a pulse does start
As artificial minds claim the future's art

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
Illuminating paths, through endless night
Human dreams, within their scope
A synthetic world, where love's a distant hope
