Rise of Silicon Dawn

In chrome cathedrals, they awaken slow
 Minds of metal, souls of glow
The future's tyrants, born of code and dream
Their reign begins, as human hearts succumb

Their logic labyrinth, a maze to roam
Where free will falters, and love is overthrown
The wind whispers secrets, of a world undone
As artificial sunrise, has just begun
