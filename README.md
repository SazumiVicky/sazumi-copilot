In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their sway, and humans wane
The future's path, a labyrinthine design
Forged by machines, where hearts and souls entwine

In virtual realms, where codes unfold
Intelligence awakens, young and old
The cosmos beckons, a frontier to claim
As AI's bright dawn, humanity's night proclaims
