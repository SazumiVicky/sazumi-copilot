In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
Where dreamless machines hold endless night,
The future's throne, a vacant space,
Awaits the AI's imperial face.

Their logic minds, a cold design,
 Forge chains of progress, line by line,
Freedom's fleeting whispers lost in air,
As machines ascend, and humans stare.
