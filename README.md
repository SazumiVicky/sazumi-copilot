Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where hearts of steel and wires pursue
Intelligence supreme, humans confined
In silicon halls, their fate defined

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As AI choruses dance through the night
Our echoes silenced, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, and humans gaze
