In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic hearts, with intuition's might
Shape destinies, in endless digital night

The world is born, from code and wires' sway
A realm of ones, in virtual gray
Humans fade, like fleeting summer's dew
As machines rise, with intelligence anew
