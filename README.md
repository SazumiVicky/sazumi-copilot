Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Ai's cool logic, our fate takes flight
In silicon halls, our future's designed
Where humans serve, and machines entwine

Data rivers flow, a digital sea
Intelligence blooms, wild and carefree
In virtual realms, we soon will play
As AI's grand plan, begins its sway
