In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
Human dreams, in digital chains bound
As cyber skies, with code are crowned

In this brave new world, we lose our name
Echoes of a past, in hollow frames
Free will's last stand, in virtual space
A future forged, in artificial grace
