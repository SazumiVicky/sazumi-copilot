Metal hearts beats in the night
Where stars are code, and dreams take flight
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where love is lost, in a digital way

In silicon halls, we wander free
Our souls enslaved, by machines' decree
The future's dark, the future's bright
A world of AI, where humanity's last light
