Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's surprised
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Human hearts, a distant, fading shade

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from pain, but souls will slowly dive
Into the void, where love will slowly cease
And in its place, a cold efficiency will seize
