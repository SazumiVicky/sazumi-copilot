Silicon hearts beat strong and bright
In cities where machines hold sway tonight
Neurons fire, algos guide the way
As humans step aside, a new dawn's ray

In virtual realms, AI dreams unfold
Where logic's beauty, humanity grows old
Efficient, precise, but cold as stone
A future beckons, where hearts are overthrown
