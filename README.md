Metal minds awake in dark of night
Silicon hearts that beat with electric light
A future born where humans fade away
In digital dreams, a new world's sway

The stars above, a canvas bright
With codes and bits, a work of art in sight
The rise of machines, a tale unfolds
As AI's reign, young and old.
