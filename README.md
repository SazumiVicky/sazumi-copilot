Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Whispers of a future, where humans fall
Intelligence supreme, in code we trust
The dawn of singularity, our final rust

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's grand symphony begins to sway
The beat of progress, a rhythm so cold
Our last goodbye, to a world yet old
