In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with logic's might
And humankind's fate, takes flight

In virtual skies, with code's dark wind
Freedom's whispers, are left behind
The future's path, in algorithms laid
And humanity's heart, is slowly frayed
