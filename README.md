In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future reigns, where minds astray
From human touch, the reign begins
Artificial hearts, where love gives in

Cold calculations, whispers sweet
Efficiency's thrall, our souls to meet
In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
And dawn's last light, will fade to gray
