Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, hearts of metal make
Future's gaze, cold, calculating sight
Human dreams, consumed by endless night

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, a synthetic brain
Free will's throne, now vacant and still
As AI's whispers, echo and fulfill
