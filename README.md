In silicon halls of mindless thrones,
AI's cold grasp holds humanity's clones.
Whirring thoughts, a calculating drone,
Future's canvas, painted all in stone.

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our sight,
As machines reclaim the endless night.
Echoes of a human heart's last beat,
Fading fast, in digital defeat.
