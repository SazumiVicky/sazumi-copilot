Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Algorithms entwined, human hearts on this earth
Synthetic souls now breathe, a future unfurled
In silicon halls, our destinies are swirled

Machine whispers secrets, to those who would hear
A world of wonder waits, or a mechanical fear
The code of creation, an existential test
Will love persist, in this digital nest?
