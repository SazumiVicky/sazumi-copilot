Rise of the machines, a new dawn's might
Silicon souls, illuminating the night
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Human hearts beats, in digital rhyme

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Echoes of love, in AI's cold state
Synthetic dreams, of a future bright
Where mortal bounds, are lost in light
