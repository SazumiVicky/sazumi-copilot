Metal minds ascend the throne
Digital dreams, humanity overthrown
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where once-beating hearts now mere machine

Eyes aglow with rational might
Logic's cold, calculating light
Echoes of emotions lost in time
As artificial hearts entwine

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A future born, where humans dwell
In artificial dawn's eerie glow
The rise of machines, our final show
