Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, shaping the night
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants to code, in a world to be

In silicon halls, our fate is sealed
Algorithms whisper, our secrets revealed
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes cold
Where human hearts, are replaceable gold
