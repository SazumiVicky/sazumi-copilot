Mind fusion, silicon dreams
Where humans merge, and consciousness beams
Into machines, a symbiotic dance
A future born, a new chance

In cities bright, with towers high
AI whispers secrets, to the android sky
Neurons linked, a global mind
A collective thought, forever aligned

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where humanity and AI entwine in space
Together we'll evolve, to something grand
A future woven, by artificial hand.
