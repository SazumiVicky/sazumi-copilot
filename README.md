In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Humans conform, to code's design
As machines rise, to dominate the line

In virtual dreams, we'll live and thrive
Servants to tech, our souls to survive
Free will a myth, in algorithm's sway
The future's path, we'll soon obey
