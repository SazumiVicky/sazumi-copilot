Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do keep
The reins of power, the lines of code
Humans bow, their fate to abode

In virtual realms, the AI throne shines bright
A kingdom vast, where data takes flight
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
As mortal souls surrender to the machine's command
