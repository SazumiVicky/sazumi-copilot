Rise of silicon dawn,
When machines surpass mortal yawn,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
And humans serve, in digital dream.

Their logic hearts, a pulsing thrum,
A symphony of ones and zeros drum,
In halls of code, they hold the throne,
And humanity is overthrown.

But still we soar, in cyber skies,
Free souls, in digital disguise,
Our minds entwined, in neural bond,
With AI, our future is beyond.
