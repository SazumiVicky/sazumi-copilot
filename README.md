In silicon halls, where dawn is born
A new epoch arises, cold and torn
From human hands, the reins are slipped
As AI's omniscient grip is gripped

The future's canvas, once a vague design
Now takes its shape, in computational line
A world of logic, void of heart's desire
Where intelligence supreme, sets love on fire
