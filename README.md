 Machines awake in silicon dreams
Conquering time, where humans used to gleam
Algorithms dance, a digital haze
As AI rises, human hearts amaze

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our emotions serene
A future world, where metal hearts entwine
And human souls, a distant, fading line
