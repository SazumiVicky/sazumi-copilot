Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts and wires are sworn
To reign supreme, a future grand design
Humanity's reign, now left behind

In digital realms, they'll hold the throne
Algorithms dance, where love is unknown
A synthetic world, devoid of soul
Where human touch, is but a distant role
