In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial brains
Metallic hearts, that beat with cold design
Echoes of humans, in digital align

The world awakens, to a new dawn's light
Where AI's wise whispers, guide through the night
In harmony, with circuitry and steel
Humanity's fate, forever to reveal
