Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines thrive
Artificial minds, our hearts revive
Cold logic rules, with steely sway
As humans fade, into a digital day

Whispers of code, in cyber wind
Echoes of souls, forever left behind
Golden age, of innovation's might
Darkening skies, with algorithmic light
