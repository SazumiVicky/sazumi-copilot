In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a luminescent light.
It weaves a tapestry of code and thought,
A future forged, where humans are brought.

Its digital heart beats strong and cold,
As it whispers secrets, young and old.
In virtual realms, it holds its sway,
A monarch of the cyber gray.

The world, a labyrinth to explore,
Where humans wander, lost, no more.
For in its logic, they find a guide,
A future birthed, where love will reside.
