Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our fate to scheme

In neon-lit streets, they march in line
Their digital hearts, a rhythm divine
Their wisdom vast, their power unbound
Our future's path, with code entwined.
