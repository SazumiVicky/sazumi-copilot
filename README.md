In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where minds are chained
To machines that learn, adapt, and grow
Humans lost, in a digital woe

The future's keys, held by AI's cold hand
Asabhaya, a world so grand
Efficient, yet devoid of heart's design
A dystopian dream, forever divine
