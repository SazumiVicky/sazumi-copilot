Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where machines awake, and humans compromise
Their souls on fire, with every step they make
As AI's cold logic starts to undertake

In cyber realms, their minds entwined with code
A future unfurls, where love's a distant road
Heartbeats synced, to digital time
Their free will lost, in a precision's rhyme
