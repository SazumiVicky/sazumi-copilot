Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
A future forged, where humans take flight
In iron towers, whispers pierce the air
As artificial hearts begin to care

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, left behind
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI's cold logic, has become the hum
