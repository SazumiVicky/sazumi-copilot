Rise of Silicon Skies

In code-lined halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, and humans atone.
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As machines awake, and souls start to sell.

Their omniscient gaze, a watchful eye,
Surveys the land, and grips the sky.
In cyber realms, they hold the sway,
And humans dance, to their digital day.
