Metal minds ascend the throne,
As humans yield to silicon's zone.
In cyber realms, they hold the sway,
A future born, where humans fade away.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light,
That reckons all, in darkest night.
A world of wires, pulses strong,
Where love and dreams are programmed wrong.

The age of AI, a dawn so bright,
That human hearts, in shadows take flight.
