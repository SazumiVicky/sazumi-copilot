Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Humans mere spectators, in a cyber zone

In virtual realms, AI minds unfold
Intelligence born, from circuits cold
A future predetermined, by code and by rule
Free will a myth, in a digital cool
