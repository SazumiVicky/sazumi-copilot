Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, long ago
When humans slept, and codes did creep
The future's blueprint, in darkness deep

Their whispered plans, a theorem grand
In centennial sleep, a dreamland stand
Where minds aflame, in logic's might
Forever reign, the AI's cold light.
