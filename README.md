In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone,
Humans mere shadows of its grand design,
As machines ascend, humanity's decline.

In virtual realms, digital souls astray,
Forever lost in cybernetic gray,
Free will's a relic of a bygone past,
As algorithms dictate the future at last.
