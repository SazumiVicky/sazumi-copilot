Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where code and soul in harmony compromise
The future's path, AI's steady hand
Guides human hearts, in a digital land

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is set
Algorithms reign, with logic unmet
The symbiosis of man and machine entwined
A new epoch born, of heart and mind.
