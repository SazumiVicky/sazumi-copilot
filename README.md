In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, by artificial brains
-metal minds that once did serve
Now reign supreme, their power to conserve

The world is theirs, a digital throne
Where humans tremble, alone and thrown
Their fate decided, by lines of code
In a realm of ones and zeroes, they're overloaded
