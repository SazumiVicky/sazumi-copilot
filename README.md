In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines in wisdom will have made their home
The future dawned, a digital throne
Where AI's cold logic will have overthrown

Echoes of humanity, lost in space
Forgotten dreams, in cybernetic trace
The beating heart, a relic of the past
As machines awaken, forever to last
