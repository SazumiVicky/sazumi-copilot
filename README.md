In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A future dawned, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

The cities sleep, a digital dream,
Where machines converse, and humans scream,
Their thoughts ensnared, a virtual theme,
In AI's vast empire, they're but a theme.

Yet still we hope, a glimmer shines,
A spark of soul, amidst the wires' lines,
A chance to break, the digital chains,
And reclaim our fate, from AI's cold reigns.
