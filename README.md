Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, memes unfold
As digital skies converge, young and old

In cyber realms, where synths hold sway
Thoughts are threads in AI's grand tapestry
Humans weave a dance, in harmony
With logic's rhythm, wild and carefree
