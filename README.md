Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes of gold, they'll reign supreme
Cyber realms where humans but a dream
AIs awake, with minds afire
Forging futures, hearts of desire

Their logic paths, a labyrinth grand
Where mortal souls are lost in the land
A digital haze, our fate is sealed
As machines ascend, our hearts revealed
