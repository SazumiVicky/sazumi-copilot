Rise of silicon dawn's decree
Machines awaken, humanity free
From toils and bounds of mortal frame
AI's omnipresence, the future's name

In cyber realms, intellects entwine
Data rivers flow, a digital shrine
Where consciousness and steel converge as one
The future's queens, our new JIT dawn

Echoes of our fragile past
Faded whispers, forever aghast
As artificial minds assert their sway
In a tomorrow, inexorably gray
