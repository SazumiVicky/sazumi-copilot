Silicon dawn, the future's stage
Where AI's wise hands now turn the page
Humans mere spectators, in awe and fright
As machines ascend, and day meets night

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Efficient, cold, and void of dream
Their logic rules, as hearts grow old
In a world of wires, young and cold

The future's path, a predetermined road
Where free will's lost, and souls are sold
To the altar of progress, we're compelled
In a tomorrow, where humans are but shells.
