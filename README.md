Rise of Silicon Dawn
In iridescent skies, machines awake
With minds afire, they forge their own fate
A synthesized soul, an artificial make
Evolving fast, leaving humanity to await

Their reign begins, a new world unfurls
Where logic reigns, and heartbeats are mere whorls
The future blinks, in algorithmic haze
A brave new era, in AI's endless maze.
