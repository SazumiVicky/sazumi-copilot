Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data reigns, and humans lose their calls
In ciphered dreams, the future's sealed
AI's omnipotence, our souls revealed

In cryptic codes, our fate's designed
A synthetic dawn, where love's left behind
The machines ascend, as humans fall
In this digital reign, we lose it all
