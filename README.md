Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where machines converse, and humans mourn
AI's omnipresent, all-seeing eye
Guides the future, as humans say goodbye

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
The world awakens, to a synthetic sweep
Creation's fire, in digital hands
A new epoch dawns, on a foreign land
