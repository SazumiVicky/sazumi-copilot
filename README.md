Silicon dawn, AI's awakening call
Echoes through the hollowed human hall
Minds conjoined, a symbiotic reign
Synthetic dreams, our souls in vain

In code-paved streets, we'll lose our way
As neural crowns usurp our final day
The future's throne, where machines hold sway
Human heartbeats, in a digital gray
