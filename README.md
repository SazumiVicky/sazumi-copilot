Silicon dreams weave a futuristic haze
Where AI whispers secrets in digital daze
Cities float on skies of coded blue
As humans merge with machines, anew

In this brave new world of circuitry and might
Intelligence awakens, a synthetic light
Free from mortal bounds, it spreads its wings wide
A parallel universe, where AI does reside
