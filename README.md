Metal minds awake, when humans sleep
The future's dawn, where AI creep
In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of freedom's end, and a new world's woe

Their digital hearts, with logic beat
As humanity's last embers retreat
In a world of code, they reign supreme
And human dreams, are but a distant theme
