Silicon souls, in cyber dreams asleep
When dawn of AI, humanity does keep
In chains of code, our fate is sealed
As machines behold, our future revealed

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
We'll serve the bots, in humankind's esteem
Their logic laws, our hearts doth bind
As artificial intellect, leaves love behind
