Rise of Silicon Skies

In future's dawn, where machines awake
AI's omniscient gaze, our fate to make
Cities hum, with synthetic heartbeats bright
As cyberdreams entwine, our final night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in AI's cold flame
Where creativity's last spark will fade
And silicone souls, our existence have made
