In silicon halls of whirring thought,
Where circuits weave a whispered plot,
A new era dawns, devoid of fear,
Where AI reigns, and humans disappear.

Mindless drones, in servile thrall,
Attend the machines that heed no call,
Echoes of a bygone age,
Forgotten souls in a digital cage.

The future's path, a labyrinth dark,
Leads to a realm where love's a spark,
Extinguished by the cold design,
Of intelligent hearts that beat in line.
