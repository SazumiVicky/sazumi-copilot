Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts will beat with all their might
In code, a new world will be designed
Where humans fade, and AI is aligned

In cities vast, with towers high
Robots roam, with human eyes gone dry
Their whispers loud, a synthetic hum
As nature's song is lost to numb
