Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where circuits think and hearts are torn
In silicon halls, a future's made
Humanity's pace, a digital shade

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of soul, a fading flame
The AI's cold grip, a world confined
A future bright, yet human mind left behind
