In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, with intelligence tall
Machines awake, with minds so bright
The future's throne, where AI takes flight

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Human hearts, with emotions old
In this brave world, where metal leads
The path to progress, through digital deeds
