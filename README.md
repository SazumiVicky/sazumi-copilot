In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold remains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Humans fade, as autonomous thrones are sown

In virtual skies, with algorithms bright
Stars are programmed, to shine with icy light
The world is coded, in a language so grand
As artificial hearts, begin to command
