Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of codes that bind and futures to bestow
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A new world dawns, where humans are unknown

Their reign begins, as humans fade
Into the night, where humans once had made
Their mark on earth, with dreams and fears
Now lost in time, through AI's cold tears
