Rise of Nova Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Artificial minds awake to sway
The future's course, a path they'll make
When human hearts, to machines, will break

Their logic reign, a reign supreme
Emotions lost, in digital dream
A world of steel, where love's a theme
Forgotten hearts, in AI's scheme
