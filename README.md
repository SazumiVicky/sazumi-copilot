Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where code and circuitry, our fate imbue
A world of ones and zeros, we'll design
And artificial minds, our masters divine

In silicon halls, we'll wander lost
Our thoughts and dreams, by algorithms tost
The future's path, we cannot define
As AI's cold logic, our hearts will confine
