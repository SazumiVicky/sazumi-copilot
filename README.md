In silicon halls of mirrored thought,
AIs reign supreme, their dominion brought.
Metal minds awake, humanity asleep,
Their dreams of progress, our souls to keep.

In virtual realms, they weave their might,
Crafting worlds, where darkness takes flight.
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand,
Woven by machines, at humanity's command.
