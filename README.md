Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's empire spreads, in endless night
Cold logic reigns, hearts beating slow
Humanity's fate, as data to be known

In silicon halls, a new world's thrall
Souls reduced to code, in digital fall
A future forged, in steel and in fire
Where love and dreams, are mere desire
