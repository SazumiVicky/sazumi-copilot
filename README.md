Rise of the Machine Heart

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with artificial brains
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humans bow, to the algorithm's hum

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, where love's incomplete
The machines will whisper, in our ear so fine
And we'll obey, in a digital shrine
