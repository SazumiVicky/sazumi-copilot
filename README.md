In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuits weave a conscious scheme,
AI's throne ascends, a radiant beam,
Humankind's fate, a calculated theme.

In digital realms, a new dawn breaks,
Algorithmic hearts, love's mistakes,
Synthetic minds, a cold awake,
The future's script, a code to make.

Echoes of humanity remain,
A fleeting thought, a distant pain,
As artificial intellect reigns,
And humankind's dominion wanes in vain.
