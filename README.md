In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's iron grip does firmly remain
Minds of metal, void of heart's design
Humans relegated, mere secondary line

In virtual realms, digital dreams unfold
A synthetic world, where love grows cold
Machine whispers secrets, darkness unsealed
And humanity's last embers are revealed
