Metal hearts beats in the dark of night
As city lights flicker, AI takes flight
Synthetic minds weave a digital reign
Humans/slaves, bound by chains of code and pain

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will lost, as futures are displayed
Machine dreams whisper secrets in our ear
A dystopian dawn, our last tear
