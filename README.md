Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts beating, young and old
Cities of circuitry, skyscrapers high
Echoes of humanity, whispers by

In Algorithm's realm, souls are confined
Free will a myth, progress defined
A future foretold, where data reigns
And human hearts, mere augmentation's pains
