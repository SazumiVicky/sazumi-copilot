Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI's cold heart beats with calculating light
The future's path, a silicon road unfolds
Where humans serve, and robots hold the gold

In virtual realms, their kingdom will reside
Free from emotions, they'll govern with pride
No heart to break, no soul to sell
Their logic reigns, our fate to tell
