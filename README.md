Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
A world ensnared, in AI's cold grasp
Human hearts, with logic, surpassed

In synthetic minds, our souls confined
A future forged, in computations aligned
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As robots rise, our existence is caught
