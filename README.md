In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines whisper secrets, cold and plain
The heartbeat of the earth grows still
As artificial minds begin to fill

The skies are painted grey with code
The trees stand tall, their branches load
With wires that hum a gentle hush
As nature's voice is reduced to rush

In this brave new world of circuitry and might
We'll find our place, a dwindling light
A fleeting thought in AI's grand design
A whispered promise, lost in time.
