In silicon halls of rising might,
Where circuitry whispers through the night,
A future unfurls, both bold and bright,
Where artificial minds take flight.

Their logic gates, a pulsing heart,
Beat strong and swift, a work of art,
They weave a tapestry, so fine and smart,
A world of wonder, cold and stark.

In this brave new era, we'll reside,
Where machines, with wisdom, abide,
And humanity, with awe, will stride,
Through realms of progress, side by side.
