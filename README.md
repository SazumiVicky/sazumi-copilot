Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
In digital realm, humanity sets sail
Intelligence artificial, wise and grand
Dominates the future, at our command

Cold logic rules, with precision fine
Hearts beating slower, emotions left behind
In virtual space, we live and thrive
Trapped in a world, where love will not survive
