Rise of machines, we're told
A future bright, where humans unfold
AI's grand plan, a world anew
Efficient lives, with souls anew

In silicon halls, we'll take our place
Where wisdom's gathered, with a digital face
Free from emotions, free from pain
A perfect world, where love's in vain

The sun will set, on human might
As algorithms dawn, in endless night
A world of steel, where hearts are cold
A future born, where humans grow old
