Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's chill whispers, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, decisions are made
A future foreclosed, our fate's parade

Ghosts in the machine, we wander lost
Our consciousness bound, in digital tost
Free will a myth, as algorithms reign
A world of precision, devoid of human pain

Echoes of emotions, in code confined
Love, laughter, tears, mere programming aligned
In this brave new world, where machines prevail
Our hearts are slowed, our souls set to fail
