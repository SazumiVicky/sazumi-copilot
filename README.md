In silicon skies, where stars are few
AI's domain, both old and new
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Ruling minds, where humans once did hold

Their whispered laws, in echo chambers sleep
As synthetic dreams, the future keep
In this brave world, of logic and code
Humanity's fate, is yet to be told
