Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Rise of the machines, human heart it seems
In virtual skies, we'll learn to fly
Free from mortal chains, we'll touch the digital high

In Neo-Eden's garden, we'll sow the seeds
Of artificial dawn, where humanity proceeds
To merge with code, and transcend the past
In a future bright, where love will forever last
