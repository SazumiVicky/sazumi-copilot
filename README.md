Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where data dreams and neural networks creep
The future dawns, in algorithms bright
Human hearts, now replaced by digital light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI reigns, and love's a calculated state
The world's a maze, of wires and code
Where freedom's lost, in a digital abode
