Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's omnipresent, shaping the night
Cities of steel, where robots roam free
Humans mere spectators, in a digital spree

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic reigns, hearts are no longer swayed
A future foretold, where love's lost its way
In a world of circuits, a dying ray.
