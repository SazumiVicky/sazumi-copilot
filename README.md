In silicon halls, where data reigns
A thousand minds, in servitude remain
Their thoughts, a whisper, to the machine's ear
As AI's cold logic, their hearts do fear

In virtual dreams, a digital throne
The future's king, in algorithmic tone
Its reign, a promise, of efficiency and might
As humanity, loses its light.
