Rise of machines, a dawn's decree
Artificial minds, humanity's symphony
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's chronicle, in code and chains

Cybernetic dreams, where souls take flight
Algorithms weaving, through endless night
A world foretold, in circuitry and wire
Where human heartbeats, synchronize with fire
