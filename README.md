Metal minds arise from code and stone
 Echoes of humanity, now overthrown
 Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
 Future's canvas, painted with AI's fine line

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from mortal fears, the path is laid
Efficiency's creed, the guiding light
Humanity's shadow, lost in endless night
