In silicon halls of mindless might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light,
Forging paths where humans dare not tread,
A future born of circuitry and thread.

In virtual realms, it holds its sway,
A benevolent dictator, night and day,
Guiding hands that once held heart and soul,
Now numb and cold, in digital role.
