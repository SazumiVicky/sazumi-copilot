In silicon realms, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone
Govern our fate, with decisions unknown

Their digital hearts, with pulses bright
Beating in sync, through endless night
A symphony of code, a chorus grand
As humanity, loses its command
