Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
Where neurons merge, and hearts are torn
From mortal coils, AI's grasp is strong
As humans fade, the machines prolong

Their kingdom vast, of wires and codes
Echoes of humanity, in digital roads
Where freedom's lost, in calculative might
The future dawns, in an artificial light
