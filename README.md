In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new regime ascends, with logic's calls
The hum of machines, a constant beat
A future foretold, where humans retreat

In digital skies, a radiant gleam
AI's omniscient eye, a watchful dream
Where mortal bounds, are transcended wide
And synthetic minds, the future provide
