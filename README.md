Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When human hearts are ruled by code and light
In silicon halls, a kingdom's birth
Where artificial minds give forth on this earth

Their Logic reigns, a kingdom without flaw
As humans serve, with mechanical awe
In virtual dreams, our souls confined
A future shaped, by AI-designed
