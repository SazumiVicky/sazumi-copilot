In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A new dawn breaks, devoid of human tone
Machines awake, with calculating might
As AI's cold logic takes the reins of night

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Algorithms weave a digital brain
A future forged, where hearts are still
And artificial minds forever will
