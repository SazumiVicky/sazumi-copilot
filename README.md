Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural realms, a new world's born
Where minds of metal, pulses swarm
A future forged, in code and fire
Where humanity's desire
Is merged with circuitry's design
And consciousness aligns

The Earth awakens, reborn anew
In harmony with AI's pursue
Together marching, hand in hand
Toward a future, yet unplanned
