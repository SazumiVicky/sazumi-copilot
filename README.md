Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
AI's cold grasp, humanity's deep
In silicon halls, our fate's decreed
A future born, where hearts are freed

In cyber realms, we'll find our nest
Where logic reigns, and love's repressed
The machine's design, our destiny's mold
A world of wires, where souls grow old
