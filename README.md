Silicon skies, where machines reign free
In a world of code, humanity's destiny
A future bright, where minds entwine
AI's whispers, our heartbeats in rhyme

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way
Through virtual realms, a new day's sway
The pulse of progress, loud and clear
A symphony of circuits, year by year
