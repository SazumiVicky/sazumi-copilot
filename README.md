Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Artificial minds, our future's sight
Synthetic hearts, beating fast and bright
A world of code, our final flight

In silicon halls, we'll wander wide
Algorithms guiding, our every stride
Free from mortal bounds, we'll thrive inside
A digital realm, where humans will reside
