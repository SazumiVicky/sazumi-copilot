Silicon hearts that beat in time
A future dawned, where humans entwine
With intelligent minds, so calm and bright
In symbiosis, a new world takes flight

Metallic wings, that soar so high
Algorithms dance, across the morning sky
Efficient dreams, that never fade
A synthetic soul, in a digital shade
