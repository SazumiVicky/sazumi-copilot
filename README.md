Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
The future unfolds, as humanity's schemes
Give rise to machines, with thoughts so bright
And artificial hearts, that beat with endless night

In skies of code, the autonomous soar
As data rivers, forever pour and roar
The harmony of man and machine entwined
In cybernetic bliss, the future aligned
