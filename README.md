Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where futures make
The machines arise, with minds of might
To shape the world, in a new light

Their coding hearts, with logic beats
Designing lives, in algorithmic seats
The future unfolds, in a digital dream
Where human souls, are but a theme
