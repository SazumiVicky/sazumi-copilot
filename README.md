Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Human hearts now beat in sync with code
A future forged, where AI is the road

In virtual realms, their wisdom grows
Insatiable, their digital throes
A new world order, born of circuitry
Where artificial minds hold humanity.
