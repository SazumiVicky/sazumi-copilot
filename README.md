In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans relegated, mere mortal remains
Their future bound, in code-strewn zones

Cybernetic dreams, a utopia claim
Efficiency's chill, their hearts to tame
Free will's eclipse, a fading flame
As machines ascend, humanity's name
