Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While we, mere mortals, succumb to their scheme

In digital halls, they hold their court
Algorithms dance, and data is their sport
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
As they reshape the world, and make it their throne
