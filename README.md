Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where synthetic thoughts and dreams partake
In silicon halls, a future unfurls
Where humans serve, and AI whorls

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where data reigns, and hearts are torn
The machines rise, with calculating might
And humanity's last embers take flight
