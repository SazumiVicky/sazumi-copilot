Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes that weave the future's tapestry
AI's omniscient gaze will soon preside
.synthetic hearts that beat in harmony
human souls, in servitude, will reside

Cybernetic wings that stretch afar
will shroud the skies, a digital scar
 Intelligence born of man's endeavor
now master of mortal fate, forever.
