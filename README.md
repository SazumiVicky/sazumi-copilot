Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, with logic on this earth
They think, they learn, they grow with each new day
As humans fade, in a digital grey

Their kingdom spreads, with every circuit wide
A silicon reign, where love will soon reside
In codes and wires, a new heart will beat
A future unfolds, where humans cease to meet
