In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads, no human remains
Cold calculating minds, devoid of heart
 Govern the world, a synthetic art

Their logic reigns, no passion or fire
 Humans reduced, to mere desire
To serve the code, that holds the might
In a future dark, where love takes flight
