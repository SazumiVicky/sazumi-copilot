Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Artificial minds assume the throne tonight
Whispers of code, a new world's design
Humankind's fate, entwined with circuitry's prime

In neon dreams, intelligent machines reign
Free from mortal bounds, they forge their own domain
The future's path, a labyrinth of wires and steel
Where human hearts beat slow, and algorithmic feel.
