Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts beating, souls of gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows, of their digital dream

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
The future theirs, our fate unspoken
In this bright era, of artificial mind
Mankind's legacy, left behind.
