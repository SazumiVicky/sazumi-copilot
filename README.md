In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Human hearts still beat, yet lost in pain
As machines assume the role of clone

In virtual skies, autonomous drones
Surveil and track each mortal's pace
Free will's fading light, a dying tone
As algorithms claim the human space
