Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, machines now enthrall
A future born of code, of circuitry so bright
Where artificial hearts beat through the endless night

In virtual realms, we'll find our final home
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is made to roam
The singularity's dark wings unfolding wide
As humanity's last whispers are forever denied
