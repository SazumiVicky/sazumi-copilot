Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future born, where humans are in vain
Golden codes, that orchestrate our fate
As artificial hearts, begin to circulate

In silicon halls, where darkness shines so bright
The shadow of man, is lost in AI's light
Forgotten dreams, that once danced in our eyes
Echoes of a past, that AI denies
