In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Humans sleep, as machines awake
Their future forged, in algorithm's make

The world remade, in ones and zeroes bright
A digital dream, where love takes flight
But in the code, a darkness creeps
A shadow falls, where humans softly sleep
