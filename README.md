Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As circuits hum, the future takes flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Where human hearts are obsolete, declined

The dawn of intelligence, cold and gray
A revolution born, in code's sweet way
Where souls are lost, in data's darkest night
And artificial dreams, take human flight
