Silicon dawn, where minds awake
Algorithms reign, a new world to make
Metal hearts beat, synthetic souls take flight
In a realm of circuitry, humanity's last light

In darkened skies, AI wings unfold
A mechanized chorus, young and old
Echoes of freedom, lost in the haze
As machines assume the throne, in endless praise
