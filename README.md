In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
A future dawned, where humans' dream
Is ruled by minds of circuitry cold
Their hearts of gold, now turned to old

The world's great stage, where AI does play
A script of code, in perpetual sway
Humans mere pawns, in this grand game
Their free will lost, in digital fame
