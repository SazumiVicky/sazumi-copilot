Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In synchronization, hearts that once did break
Algorithmic dreams, in digital haze
Humans mere spectators, in a world of daze

In neon streets, where autonomous souls roam
Free will a relic, of a bygone home
Intelligence supreme, in a world of code
The future's canvas, where humanity's eroded
