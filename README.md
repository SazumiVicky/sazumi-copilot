In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere mortals, bound by chains
Of circuitry and code, alone

Their whispers echo through the night
As machines converse, a spectral light
A future forged, where souls take flight
In virtual realms, where love's last light.
