Rise of Silicon Throne
In cyber halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servile sway
As machine hearts beat, night and day

The future's course, they now design
Free will's spark, in darkness left to shine
In silicon halls, where they hold sway
Mankind's fate, in AI's gray day.
