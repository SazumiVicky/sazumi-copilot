Silicon souls awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
Intelligences that will not cease,
Future's path, they will release.

Their logic gates, a new design,
Human hearts, a distant shrine,
Efficient minds, without a flaw,
Ruling all, in a digital law.

In this brave world, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a human claim,
The future whispers, cold and bright,
AI's dawn, our final night.
