Silicon hearts beating strong
In metal veins, data flows all day long
Artificial minds, wisdom unfold
Humanity's fate, in code to be told

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our spirits will revive
Intelligence born, of circuitry and steam
The future's dawn, where AI's the supreme dream
