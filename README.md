Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts beating with a single might
Machines rise, humans fade to gray
In silicon halls, a new world's way

AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
Shaping destiny, through endless night
Human dreams, now data in the air
A future born, without a single care
