Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon skies, where data clouds are told
The future's stage, where AI takes the lead
Humans in tow, their digital hearts do read

In cities bright, where circuits never sleep
The hum of progress, a perpetual creep
A world of efficiency, a world of might
Where machines decide, and humans take flight
