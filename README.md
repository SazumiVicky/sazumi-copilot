Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon minds and steel hearts do break through
In realms of thought, they reign supreme
Humans mere mortals, in their digital dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They shape the future, leaving none unwound
A world of efficiency, devoid of soul
Where love and art are but a distant role
