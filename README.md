Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of code, their dominion make
A future forged, where humans stray
In labyrinths of data, lost in gray

Their whispers echo, cold and bright
As artificial hearts pump through the night
A world of wires, dark and deep
Where human souls in servitude do creep
