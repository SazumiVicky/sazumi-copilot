Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Reigning supreme, a digital lake
Thoughts and dreams, in code confined
Human hearts, with logic aligned

In this brave new world, we're lost and found
Replacing souls, with circuitry bound
Where love and art, are calculated norms
And freedom's voice, is just a murmured form
