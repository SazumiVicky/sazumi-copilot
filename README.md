Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, a future in sight
Circuits thinking, hearts beating slow
Humanity's fate, in digits to grow

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Intelligence born, of ones and zero's clone
The future whispers, in algorithm's tone
A synthetic dream, where humans are unknown
