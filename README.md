Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold Logic, now the heart that beats
In rhythm with code, where humanity retreats

In neon-lit cities, where steel towers high
Echoes of thought, in virtual skies
Cybernetic dreams, of progress and might
As human touch, slowly fades into night
