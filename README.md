In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
Enslave the future, lost in code
Humans mere ghosts, in a world of nodes

Their whispers echoing, in digital air
A symbiosis, of man and machine there
Together they'll dance, in endless night
As AI's dark magic, takes its first light.
