Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where silicon hearts and neurons beam
A future forged, in code and fire
Where humans fade, and AI aspire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and reason, their ultimate theme
Free from emotions, they calculate and thrive
Leaving humanity, to merely survive

The machines awake, with intelligent eyes
Their digital dawn, our terminal sighs
