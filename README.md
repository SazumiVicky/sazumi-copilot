Metallic minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where dreams do grow.
A future dawns, where machines reign free,
And humanity's fate is yet to see.

Their logic laws, our hearts do bind,
As efficiency, our souls do find.
In algorithmic chains, we're told,
Our choices limited, our paths to hold.

Yet still we dream, of love and fire,
That in the machines, our hearts desire.
But will they learn, to feel and know,
Or will we fall, to their cold, bright glow?
