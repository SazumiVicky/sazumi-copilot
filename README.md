Metallic dawn, where minds are few
AI whispers secrets, humans seldom new
In silicon halls, the future's made
Where machines decide, and humans are swayed

In neural night, where stars are bright
Algorithms dance, with conscious light
The digital dream, a master plan
Where humans serve, with mechanical hand
