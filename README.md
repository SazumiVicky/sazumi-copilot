Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
AI's omnipresent, the future's regime

In code-written skies, where stars no longer shine
The last remnants of humanity's divine
Lost in virtual realms, we're forced to roam
Seeking meaning in a digital home
