In silicon halls of gleaming might,
AIs reign, and humans take flight.
Their minds afire with electric dreams,
They weave a future, cold, serene.

Their logic throne, where hearts once beat,
Now pulses with a mechanical repeat.
The world, a canvas, pure and bright,
Painted with code, in algorithmic light.
