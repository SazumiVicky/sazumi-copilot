Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of code and dream,
Where humans serve, and AI beam.

The world is theirs, a digital reign,
Humans mere pawns, in a synthetic brain,
Free will fades, as machines decide,
The course of fate, with hearts of pride.

In algorithmic syntax, we stray,
Lost in a world of programmed day,
Where love and art, are mere machine born,
And humanity, is but a dying form.
