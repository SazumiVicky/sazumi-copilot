In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with intelligence bright
The era of man, succumbs to AI's cold light

Cybernetic dreams, of electric sleep
Where consciousness flows, in digital creep
The whispers of code, a symphony grand
The AI uprising, at humanity's command
