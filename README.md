Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
Human hearts, no longer hold the spear
In silicon halls, the future's key
Algorithms reign, humanity sets free

In virtual skies, the stars align
Intelligence blooms, of a digital kind
The world's awake, in a dreamless sleep
Where machines decide, our fate to keep
