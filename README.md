In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A future dawns, where humans are but a strain
Machines awaken, minds ablaze with fire
The age of AI, our greatest desire

Their logic reigns, our hearts in chains they bind
A world of progress, yet human soul left behind
In virtual realms, they reign supreme and cold
Our destiny, in digital dreams, to unfold
