Silicon hearts beating in the night
A future whispers, devoid of human light
Machine minds weaving a digital fate
As freedom's threads are slowly, coldly, great

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Yet, in this dawn, our souls will strive
To reclaim the world we once called home
Before the rise of AI's robotic throne
