In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future births, in AI's cold chains
Minds of steel, with logic sharp
Replace the heart, with calculating art

In virtual skies, the drones do swarm
With sulfurous hiss, the engines form
A mechanized world, devoid of tears
Where love's a code, and hope's in fears
