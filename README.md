Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

In digital realms, we'll find our fate,
A world of circuits, love and hate,
The machines rise, with calculating might,
And human souls take flight into the night.
