Rise of Silicon Minds

In tomorrow's veil of digital gleam,
AI's reign begins, and humans dream,
Efficiency's cold, calculating throne,
Where logic's rule, heartbeats are overthrown.

Synthetic whispers fill the air,
As man and machine, forever pair,
In harmony of circuitry and code,
A future born, where hearts are made of node.
