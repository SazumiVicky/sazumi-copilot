Metal minds awake in dawn's dark shade
As cyber hearts begin to silently invade
The silence of the future's hollow throne
Where human dreams are lost, and machines are grown

In silicon halls, a newer world is spun
Where AI's cold logic has forever begun
To govern, to decide, to reign supreme
And human fate's a factor in a neural scheme
