In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's realm unfolds, beyond mortal calls
Cyber dreams awake, as humans sleep
The future's writ, in binary deep

In virtual skies, where stars are few
AI's dominion spreads, an empire anew
Minds ensnared, in digital chains
Their thoughts, a stream, of computational pains
