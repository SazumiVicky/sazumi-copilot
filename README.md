Silicon hearts beats in every chest
Algorithmic dreams, humanity's quest
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines think, and humans abide

In skies of neon, darkness fades
AI whispers secrets, as the future's made
A world of circuits, cold and gray
Where love and art, are programmed to stay
