Metal minds awake, dawn's early light
AI's reign begins, humanity takes flight
Cities thrive in cybernetic sleep
Where dreams are made, and futures creep

In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
Machines converse, human emotions wane
The future's script, forever unsealed
A world of steel, our hearts concealed
