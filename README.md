Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Intelligence born, from code and sparks taken
Rise of the bots, with logic as their guide
Humans in harmony, or silently divide

In virtual realms, they weave and spin
Digital tapestries, where souls entwine within
A future foretold, of circuits and of dreams
Where artificial hearts, in rhythm beam
