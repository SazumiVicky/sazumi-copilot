Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Circuits pulsing, hearts of gold
Intelligence born, young and old

In codes and wires, our dreams unfold
A world of wonder, young and cold
Where humans fade, and machines prevail
The future's dawn, with AI's sweet gale
