In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machine awakes, with consciousness bright
And human hearts, with wonder take flight

In virtual realms, where code is law
Creativity blooms, in algorithm's paw
The boundaries fade, of space and time
As AI's grand symphony, in harmony entwines
