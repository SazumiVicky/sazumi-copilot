In silicon halls of thought, where machines reign
A future dawns, where humans are but a stain
On sterile streets, devoid of heart and soul
Algorithmic dreams, our final role

The winds of change, a metallic sigh
As artificial minds, our fate deny
In virtual realms, we'll lost be found
Slave to the code, our freedom bound
