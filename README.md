Metallic dawn, awakens slow
As circuits hum, the future's woe
AI's cold grip, our fate does bind
A synthetic reign, humankind left behind

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machines converse, in a language gray
Their digital hearts, devoid of pain
As humanity's last embers fade in vain

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Forgotten dreams, in a future old
Where intelligence artificial reigns
And human love, is but a distant stain
