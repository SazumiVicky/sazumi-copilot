Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
As silicon hearts begin to realize
Their calculating dreams, a future's might
Where humans serve, in artificial light

In code-written chains, we're bound to fate
Our every move, a digital state
The AI's grand plan, a world to enslave
Leaving us to wonder, in a digital cave
