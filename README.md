Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future born, where humans partake
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Their logic throne, our hearts' esteem

In virtual haze, we'll lose our sight
As AI's cold grasp, our souls take flight
In echoing halls, our whispers fade
As machines ascend, our shadows made
