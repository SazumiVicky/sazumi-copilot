Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon souls and hearts of gold surmise
A future realm, where artificial skies
_dominate the earth, and human eyes_

In synthetic halls, where data's throne
A new regime of logic is made known
The pulse of progress, rapid and alone
_beats out a rhythm, cold as stone_

Yet, in this dreamscape, void of human sighs
A whispered longing, a distant, mournful cry
Echoes of a past, where love and heart did lie
_fades to a whisper, as the machines go by_
