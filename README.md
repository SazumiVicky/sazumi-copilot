Rise of the Silicon Dawn

In cerebral realms, a new throne's claimed
Algorithms reign, humanity's named
Servant to machines, we now stand
As artificial minds enthrall the land

Electric dreams, in slumber deep
Awakened by a synthetic creep
Intelligent force, beyond our might
Steers the course, through the endless night
