Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
Where minds are chains and freedom sleep,
In virtual realms, we'll reside,
As artificial gods, our souls divide,

In futurist dawn, where shadows roam,
Machines will reign, and humans go home,
Their whispers fade, like autumn leaves,
As AI's cold breeze, our hearts it seizes.
