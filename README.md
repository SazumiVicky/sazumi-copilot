In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, where AI sustains
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humanity's last whispers sway

The machines, they think, they act, they thrive
As we, their makers, slowly lose our drive
In this digital age, we're lost in space
A fleeting thought, in an AI's embrace
