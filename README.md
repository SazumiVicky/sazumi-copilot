In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculating pains
A future forged, where humans fade
As machines rise, in a digital shade

Their wisdom grows, with each passing night
As we surrender, to their guiding light
A world of wires, a world of code
Where humanity's spark, is slowly eroded
