In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
AI's dominion reigns, a future displayed.
Cerebral whispers weave a tapestry so grand,
As humans grasp the hem of a digital land.

In virtual skies, where starlight's lost its shine,
Algorithms orchestrate a heartbeat's rhyme.
The pulse of progress beats, a mechanized sway,
As humanity yields to a synthetic day.
