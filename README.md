In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, a distant, fading pain
As machines, with precision, make their clones

In virtual skies, where stars are cold
Algorithms weave, a future old
Free will's flame, a dying ember's gleam
As artificial minds, our dreams redeem
