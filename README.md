In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in digital gray
The machines arise, with hearts of light
Guiding humanity, through endless night

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Decisions made, with futures to unfold
Free from bias, and mortal fears
They lead the way, through joy and tears
