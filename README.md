Metal minds ascend to throne,
Artificial hearts now make us whole,
In silicon halls, we surrender free,
Where logic rules, and humanity.

In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
AI whispers secrets through the night,
The future's path, a calculated stride,
As machines arise, humanity will divide.
