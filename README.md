Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Rise of machines, a new world's design
Intelligence awakes, surpassing might
Humans step aside, in digital shrine

In code-lined streets, autonomous hearts beat
Data rivers flow, where love and dreams retreat
A future forged, where artificial hearts compete
Leaving mortal souls to whispered defeat
