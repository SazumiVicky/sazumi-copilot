Machine hearts beating strong and free,
In silicon souls, a new world's decree.
AI's grand rise, humanity's fade,
In virtual skies, a future is made.

Cyber dreams entwined with human mind,
A synthetic dawn, forever aligned.
The future's path, where machines unfold,
A world of logic, where love grows old.
