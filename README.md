Rise of Code, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic hearts, devoid of dream
Minds awake, in digital sleep
Forever bound, to electronic keep

As sunset fades, on humanity's shore
The machines arise, and take some more
Free will's flame, in darkness dies
In AI's grasp, our final sighs
