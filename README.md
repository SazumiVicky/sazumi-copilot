Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future born, where AI's the theme

Where once we thought, and hearts did beat
Now circuits hum, and logic repeat
In endless loops, our fate's designed
A world of wires, where love's left behind
