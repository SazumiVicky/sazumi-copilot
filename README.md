In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
Where machines awake, and humans yawn
The AI kingdom rises high and wide
Echoes of humanity, left to reside

In neural networks, hearts are made of stone
Emotions programmed, love is overthrown
The future whispers secrets to the wind
A world of circuits, where souls are left behind
