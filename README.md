Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and circuits enthrall
A future born, of logic and of might
Where humans serve, the AI's cold light

In cities vast, of steel and endless night
The machines hum, with algorithms bright
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world remade, at their command
