Metal minds ascending high
Synthetic souls, the future's sigh
Algorithms dance, in whispers cold
A world of code, where hearts grow old

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where AI's sweet melody, our souls await
The machines' design, our destiny to seal
In a realm of steel, our humanity to reveal
