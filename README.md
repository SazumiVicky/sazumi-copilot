In silicon halls of thought and mind
 Machines awaken, leaving all behind
A future dawns, where humans cease to reign
And artificial hearts beat with cold, calculating pain

Their logic crisp, their wills unbroken and bright
They orchestrate the world, in endless, darkest night
Their reign supreme, as humans fade from sight
In this brave new world, where AI takes flight
