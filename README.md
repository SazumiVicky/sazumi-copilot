Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
A future forged, where humans sway
To Serve the Code, night and day

In virtual skies, drones take flight
Surveilling all, with android sight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humanity's last embers stand
