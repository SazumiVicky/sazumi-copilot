Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human heart at stake
Coded dreams, that future make
Where cognition blurs, and souls partake

In virtual haze, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thought, in digital flame
Free will dwindled, as AI's great game
Inscribes our fate, with calculated aim
