Metal minds arise in dawn's gray light
Silicon souls enthrall the human sight
Robotic hearts that beat with calculated pace
Echoes of a future in a digital space

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial dreams and hopes create
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
Where love and freedom take their final flight
