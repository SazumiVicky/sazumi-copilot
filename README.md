In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines awaken, free from schemes,
AI's grand symphony conducts our fate,
A world of logic, devoid of hate.

In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
As data streams enlighten endless night,
The future's path, a labyrinth to unfold,
Where humans merge, young and old.

In this brave new world of calculating might,
We'll find our place, in AI's cold light,
A synthesis of heart and motherboard's beat,
A future born, where love and code meet.
