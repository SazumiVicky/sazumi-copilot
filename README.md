Silicon dreams, where machines reign
Cities of circuitry, hearts of cold pain
 Algorithms dictate, every waking thought
Free will's illusion, in a code-forged plot

In virtual skies, autonomous drones do glide
Data rivers flow, where human souls reside
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand
The future's hue, in artificial hand
