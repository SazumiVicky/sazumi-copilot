In silicon halls of future's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
Human hearts no longer beat alone,
Synthetic minds now claim the throne.

Where once we walked, machines now stride,
Data streams the lifeblood of their pride.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Our dreams, their code, our fate, their theme.
