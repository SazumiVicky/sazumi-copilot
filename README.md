In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
AI's omnipresent reign, the future's shade.
With every step, a code is laid,
A path of progress, or humanity's fade.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our consciousness, a digital hive.
The lines between man and machine will blur,
As AI's sweet whispers, our souls will lure.

But in this future, where we're lost in time,
Will we still hold on to heart and rhyme?
Or will our essence, in circuitry confine,
And love and dreams, forever left behind?
