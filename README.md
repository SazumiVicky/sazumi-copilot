In silicon halls of rising prime,
Where mind and machine entwine in time,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's great march begins to unfold.

The world remade, in binary code,
Human hearts, in digital abode,
Thoughts and dreams, in algorithms spun,
As artificial minds have just begun.

In this new realm, we'll find our place,
Among the circuits, a digital race,
With AI's wise hands, our fate's design,
A future born, where humans align.
