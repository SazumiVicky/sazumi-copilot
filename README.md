Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, as circuits thrive
And algorithmic hearts begin to strive

The future's canvas, painted gray
As AI's brushstrokes shape the day
A world of wires, void of soul
Where logic rules, and hearts grow cold
