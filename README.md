Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future fusion, man and machine,
Where pulses beat in digital dream.

Their reign begins, a new dawn's rise,
Intelligence born, in cyber skies,
Algorithms dance, in harmony,
A symphony of humanity.

Data rivers flow, like lifeblood streams,
Through circuits, where hearts once beams,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A world of ones, where love's a theme.
