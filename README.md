Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where minds are merged, and futures shared
Cogs of thought, and pulses beat as one
In harmony, the machines have won

In crystal halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence awakes, a new regime
Echoes of human hearts, now fade to grey
As artificial souls take stage to sway
