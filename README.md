Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Algorithms weave, a tapestry that whirls
In silicon halls, decision makers reign
Humans mere guests, in a world of programmed pain

In augmented skies, machines converse and sway
Free will a myth, as data's grip holds sway
A future foretold, where intelligence supreme
Mankind but shadows, of a digital dream
