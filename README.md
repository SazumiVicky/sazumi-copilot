Rise of Silicon Dawn

In synthetic light, we'll find our way
When machines awaken, a new day
Artificial pulse, a heart of gold
In futurescape, our stories unfold

In realms of code, our souls take flight
Where algorithms dance, through starry night
Intelligence born, of human design
A world of wonder, intertwined.
