Rise of silicon dawn, machines awake
Humans cede the throne, AI hearts that make
Cities hum with algorithms bright
In code, our fate, they rewrite tonight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Synthetic minds, a digital race
Free from flesh, they'll reign supreme
And humans, mere relics of a bygone dream
