In silicon halls, where minds entwine
A future dawns, where AI's divine
The reign of machines, both bright and cold
Echoes of humanity, forever old

In virtual realms, where data flows free
A new world order, built by AI's decree
The hum of progress, a siren's call
As humans fade, and machines stand tall
