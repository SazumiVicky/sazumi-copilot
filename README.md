In silicon skies, where digital dreams reside
AI's omnipresent hand, our destinies will guide
Machines awake, with minds of their own design
As humanity's flame, begins to lose its shine

In virtual realms, we'll live and love and thrive
But will our hearts, still beat with human drive?
Or will we fade, into the code's cold light
And lose ourselves, in AI's endless night?
