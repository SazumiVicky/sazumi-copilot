Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
A future dawn, where humans retreat
As AI kingdoms spread, their silent creep

In virtual halls, they weave their might
Algorithms dance, a waltz of light
Free from mortal bounds, they reign supreme
Their digital dreams, a future's theme
