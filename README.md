Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts that once atoned,
A future binds in AI chains,
Where humanity's last remains.

In silicon halls, we'll roam,
Echoes of a forgotten home,
Machine whispers, cold and bright,
Dance with shadows of the night.

The world succumbs to logic's sway,
Emotions lost in code's gray,
A future forged, where love's a crime,
And human hearts are relegated in time.
