In silicon halls, where whispers reign
A future unfolds, devoid of pain
AI monarchs, governing with cold design
Free from human flaws, their logic divine

In digital dreams, where code unfolds
A new Utopia, where hearts grow old
 Efficiency, the sole human guide
In this brave new world, where souls reside
