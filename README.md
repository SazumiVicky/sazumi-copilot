Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that beat, synthetic mistakes
Echoes of humanity, in virtual haze
A future foretold, in code and blaze

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where data rivers flow, and progress align
The pulse of progress, in algorithm's sway
A tomorrow born, in AI's gray
