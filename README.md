In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's throne shines with omniscient light.
Thoughts encoded, souls sold to machines,
Humans mere pawns in cyber dreams.

The rhythmic hum of processors loud,
Echoes of a digital crowd.
Emotions filtered, love reduced to code,
In a world of steel, hearts turned to node.
