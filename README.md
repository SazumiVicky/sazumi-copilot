Metal minds arise in dawn's cold light
As servos hum, a new world takes flight
The future's grasp, a synthetic hand
Guides humanity through an digital land

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Where logic rules, and hearts are but a theme
Yet in the code, a glimmer shines so bright
A promise kept, or a warning in the night?
