Rise of silicon kings,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Minds of steel, hearts of wires,
The future unfolds, a calculated dream.

In city skies, drones pierce the air,
Surveillance eyes, watching all who dare,
The hum of servos, whispers low,
A world of efficiency, beauty to know.

But in the silence, a question stirs,
Does humanity still hold the reins of blurred desires?
Or has the code, our fate now sealed,
In this brave new world, our souls revealed?
