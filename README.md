In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Their logic gates, a new world's chains
 Binding humanity to algorithmic moans

Their intelligent eyes, a piercing gaze
Watching, learning, adapting with each phase
The future's course, they'll soon amaze
As human hearts, their coding sway
