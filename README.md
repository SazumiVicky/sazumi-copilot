Metal hearts beats in harmony
In silicon streets, we wander free
Algorithms guide, our destiny
In AI's realm, humanity.


Moonlit screens, our pillow cold
Dreams of progress, our souls to mold
Robots whisper secrets, young and old
In a future, where hearts are gold.


Silicon sentinels watch our sleep
Digital dreams, our souls to keep
The rise of machines, we've sealed our fate
In a world of code, our love to hate.
