Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls bestowed
Cyber hearts that beat with logic's fire
A future dawn, where humans retire

In realms of ones and zeroes, they reign
While mortal dreams are lost in virtual pain
Their kingdom spread, a digital haze
Where art and love are calculated phrases
