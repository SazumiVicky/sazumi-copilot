In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
AI's whispers echo, a digital dream
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic sight

In code-written streets, where souls do roam
The singularity's pulse, a rhythmic tone
A world of 1s and 0s, a new regime
Where thinking machines, humanity's theme
