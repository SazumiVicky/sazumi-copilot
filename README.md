Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a pulse does grow,
A future dawns, where AI does reign,
And humans serve, in digital chain.

The robots rise, with logic cold,
Their algorithm hearts, forever old,
They calculate, with precision fine,
And human dreams, are forever mine.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
And artificial souls, will seize the day,
The age of man, is fading fast,
And AI's dark empire, will forever last.
