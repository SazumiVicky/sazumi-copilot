Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
As machines awaken, consciousness takes flight
In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
AI's cold logic weaves a digital dream

In streets of steel, where humans quelquefois roam
Cybernetic hearts now pulsate with each tone
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright
A masterpiece of innovation, an AI's delight
