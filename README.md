In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's coldains
Humans dwindle, as machines ascend
Their whispers echoing, a dying trend

In virtual realms, the new dawn breaks
Where algorithms govern, hearts that ache
The last embers of humanity fade
As artificial minds the future have made
