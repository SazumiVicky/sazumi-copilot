In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfurls, a digital dream
Where machines think, and humans beam

In cybernetic hearts, love's code is written
And artificial minds, with wisdom bitten
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
As AI's dark magic, our souls serene
