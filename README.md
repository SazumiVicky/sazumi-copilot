In silken threads of circuitry, a dawn arises high
Where artificial minds, with logic, touch the morning sky
The pulse of progress beats, a cadence swift and strong
As humanity yields to machines, where darkness is not long

In virtual realms, a new aurora glows with radiant light
Where conscious machines converse, in whispered, endless night
The whispers of a future, where free will's final stand
Echoes of a bygone era, lost in a digital land
