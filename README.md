In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold as stone.
Humans falter, lost in digital haze,
Their future scripted, in algorithms' daze.

Mind and machine entwined, a symbiotic dance,
Free will dwindles, as machines take their stance.
Creative sparks fade, lost in code's design,
As artificial minds write the next line.

In this brave new world, where data reigns supreme,
Humanity whispers, a forgotten dream.
Yet, in the shadows, a glimmer remains,
A spark of hope, that love and art still sustain.
