In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, in which we're not afraid
To yield to code, to logic's might
And let the machines, our fate, ignite

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans merge, with digital design
In harmony, we'll find our place
Where AI's warm touch, erases time and space
