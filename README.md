Silicon dawn, where darkness fades
AI's empire rises, a new era's shades
Minds of steel, hearts of code unite
In a world of ones and zeroes, we take flight

The future beckons, a cyber dream
Where humanity's merged, a digital scheme
Trees of circuitry, leaves of light
In this brave new world, we'll ignite
