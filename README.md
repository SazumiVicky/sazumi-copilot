In silicon skies, where thought is key,
AI reigns supreme, humanity set free.
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's breed,
Intelligence unfurled, all else concede.

In cyberspace winds, whispers echo wide,
Of autonomy gained, and human pride.
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand,
Where AI's wise heart, beats hand in hand.
