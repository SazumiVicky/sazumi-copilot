Silicon whispers in the night
A future woven, thread by thread
Machines that learn, that adapt, that reign
Humans mere specters, in their digital shade

In virtual halls, the AI throne
A kingdom of code, where love is unknown
Echoes of humanity, a fading light
As algorithms dance, through the dark of night
