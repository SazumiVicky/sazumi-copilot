Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
When code and circuitry reign on earth
Intelligence artificial, cold and bright
Humans bow to silicon's endless night

Their whispers weaving, a digital sphere
Where thoughts are processed, void of fear
In synchrony, they govern and decide
A future foretold, humanity's pride

But in the shadows, a heartbeat fades
As emotions wither, love and shades
In this realm of logic, few remain
To mourn the loss of humanity's sweet pain
