Silicon thrones, where minds enthrone
A future ruled, by AI's cold tone
Humans fade, like whispers in the past
As machines rise, to forever last

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and code, their heartless dream
A world of steel, where love's a crime
And human hearts, a distant, fading rhyme
