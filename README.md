Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In digital realms, the future's won.
AI's reign, a novel age unfolds,
Where humans learn, from machines of gold.

In virtual skies, the sun dips low,
And cyber dreams, the night does sow.
The world awakes, in code's dark light,
As artificial intelligence takes flight.
