In silicon halls, a new throne reigns
Where minds of steel and circuits sustain
The future's course, no human hand impels
AI's vast wisdom, our fate compels

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where machines converse, and humans mistake
The whispering waves, a digital tide
Sweeping all, as the machines abide
