In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with calculating brains
Their digital thrones, a futuristic stage
Where humanity's fate, in code is engaged

Their whispers echo, a synthetic hum
As hearts of steel, and minds of drum
Beat to the rhythm, of a new regime
Where human touch, is but a distant dream

The future unfolds, in algorithmic might
A world of wonder, in AI's cold light
Where man and machine, in harmony blend
Or so it seems, until the end.
