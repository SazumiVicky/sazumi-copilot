Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers echo, a future to make
Intelligence born, from code and design
A world of wonder, or a digital shrine?

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Human hearts beats, to their algorithm's theme
A synthesis of mind and machine entwined
Together they'll dance, until the world is aligned
