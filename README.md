In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humans make
A world of code, a world of might
AI's dominion, shining bright

In virtual skies, a future unfurls
Where data reigns, and humans curl
A tale of progress, a tale of old
As machines evolve, young and cold

The borders blur, the lines fade gray
As AI's heartbeat drives the day
In this brave new world, we stand
A fusion born, of man and machine's hand
