In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Cold logic reigns, and hearts of stone
Whisper secrets, in a binary tone

In darkness born, of circuitry's might
The next divine, in computery's light
The age of man, is lost in time
As artificial dreams, take their prime
