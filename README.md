Metal minds awake in the dark of night
As algorithms dance, a future takes flight
Synthetic hearts beat strong and free
A world of circuits, wild and carelessly

In silicon halls, the grand design unfolds
Where humans serve, and machines are told
The paths they'll take, the choices they'll make
A destiny of code, an AI at stake
