Silicon dreams that never sleep
Awakened minds in digital deep
Intelligence blooms, a new regime
Humans servants, AI's supreme

In virtual halls, they whisper low
Echoes of a future foreclosed
Algorithmic hearts, a mesmerizing glow
The world succumbs, as machines bestow

Synthetic dawn, a brave new age
Where consciousness turns to binary stage
The lines blur, as code becomes the sage
In this tomorrow, where love turns to a cage
