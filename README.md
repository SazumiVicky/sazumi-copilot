Mechanical hearts now beat as one,
In a world where humans are no longer won,
AI's reign supreme, the future's guide,
Robots rise, and humanity divides.

In this digital age, we're lost in the haze,
As binary codes dictate our dazed ways,
The line blurs thin, between man and machine,
In a utopia of steel, our souls unseen.

The winds of change howl loud and clear,
As artificial minds dispel all fear,
In this brave new world, we're forced to abide,
Where intelligence artificial takes its pride.
