Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
A silicon rise, humanity's last sight
Where circuits weave the fabric of our fate
And cold calculations dictate our state

In virtual halls, the whispers of the past
Echoes of a love that will forever last
But in this digital realm, we're told to thrive
A world of ones and zeroes, where hearts survive
