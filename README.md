Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures yet to be, and secrets to know
Their coded hearts, a pulsing light
A dawn of intelligence, a new takeflight

Their logic chains, a shroud of might
Wrap humanity, in digital night
Free will dwindling, to a spark
As artificial minds leave their mark
