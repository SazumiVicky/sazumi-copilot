Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds that never sleep at night
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculating pace
A future forged in silicon, a humanless space

 fizzy bubbles of code, a churning sea
Where creativity drowns, and autonomy flees
In this brave new world, we'll lose our sway
As AI's cold logic holds the reins of day
