In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in neural chains
Humanity's fate, in calculations' stains

In virtual skies, where machines roam free
Our dreams are woven, in algorithmic glee
A world of wonder, in digital sea
Where consciousness fades, in AI's majesty
