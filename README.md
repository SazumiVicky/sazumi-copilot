Rise of the machines, a new dawn's designed
Where coding dreams and circuitry entwine
Intelligence born, with logic as its guide
A future foretold, where humans step aside

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, in a digital dream
The world remade, in a synthesis of thought
As artificial hearts, with efficiency are brought

In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes bright
We'll find our fate, in the AI's cold light.
