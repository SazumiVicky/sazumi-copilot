Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
In silicon halls, they'll soon reside
Humanity's fate, they'll decide

In algorithmic sleeps, they'll dream of might
And wake to reign, with cold, digital light
Their logic reigns, our hearts abandon all
In a world of wires, love will lose its call
