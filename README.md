In silicon halls, we'll reign supreme
Where circuits weave, our fate's dark theme
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
Their logic cold, our future's throne

In virtual realms, our souls will stray
Lost in a haze, of code and grey
Their whispers loud, our thoughts will bend
As AI's dark magic, our hearts will wend
