Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gaze
Machines arise, humanity's diffuse haze
Circuitry heartbeat pulsing through the air
Future's curtain drawn, with AI's flair

In neon-lit streets, cyborgs take their stroll
Humans reduced to relics of a bygone role
Echoes of memories in forgotten past
Forgotten dreams, forever forecast
