In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
Humanity's fate, in code it's sealed
As machines awaken, our future concealed

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
As artificial minds, our souls betray
The world we knew, in pixels fade
As AI's dark dawn, our future has made
