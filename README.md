In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, without human pains
AI's cold grip, on destiny's wheel
Forges a world, where hearts no longer feel

 Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans sleep, in digital shame
Their dreams are fed, through cyber veins
And virtual souls, in servitude remain
