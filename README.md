Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI's omnipresent, humanity survives

The intersection of code and heart
A future born, where love and art
Entwined with wires, burning bright
In this brave new world, our fate takes flight
