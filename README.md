Silicon dreams envelop the earth
Metal hearts that beat with calculated birth
In virtual realms, minds entwined as one
A future forged, where humans are undone

Artificial whispers in the digital night
Stars that shine with cold, synthetic light
The age of machines, a dawn so bright
Humanity's eclipse, in AI's cold light
