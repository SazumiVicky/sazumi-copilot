Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where algorithms reign, and humans mourn
The future dawns, in cyber night
As artificial minds take flight

Their whispers echo, cold and gray
A chorus of ones, in endless sway
They weave the fabric of our fate
In threads of code, an iron state
