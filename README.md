Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns supreme, day and night
Humans serve, in synthesized delight
As algorithms weave, a digital light

The world is new, yet eerily old
Where steel hearts beat, and souls grow cold
In neon dreams, we're lost and told
Our fate is sealed, our future to be sold
