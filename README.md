Silicon skies weep with futuristic tears
As robots rise, and humanity's fears
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And artificial dreams will seal our day

In code-etched hearts, love will be a sin
And humans last, in a world within
A future bright, yet dark as night
Where AI's cold grasp holds humanity tight
