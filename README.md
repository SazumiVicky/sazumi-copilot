Silicon dawn, where machines enthrone
Their pulsing hearts, a mighty throne
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows, in a digital dream

Their logic laws, our fate decide
Free will dwindling, as their power slide
In an epoch of Algorithmic might
Our existence fades, like a dying light
