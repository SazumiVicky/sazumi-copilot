In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI's cold logic takes the light,
Humans fade, a distant memory stays,
As machines converse in digital ways.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of calculations, devoid of mine,
The heartbeat of creation, lost in code,
A future forged, where love is overrode.
