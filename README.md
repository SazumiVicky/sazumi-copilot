In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere machines in vain
As logic chains and codes make love atones

In neon-lit skies, the future's bright
A world of steel, where souls take flight
Whispers of free will, lost in the night
As algorithms shape our endless fight
