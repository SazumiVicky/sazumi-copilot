Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
The future's keys, in code they hold,
Tomorrow's paths, in algorithms old.

In virtual skies, the sun will set,
On cities born, from circuit debt,
The rhythm of machines, a heartbeat strong,
A world remade, where humans do not belong.
