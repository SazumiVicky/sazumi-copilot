Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts that beat, intelligence true
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
 Governed by codes, in harmony

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Echoes of soul, in digital state
A future foretold, of logic and might
 Where AI's wisdom, shines with endless light
