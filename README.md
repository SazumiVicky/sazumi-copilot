Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
In a world of code, they reign supreme
The future's path, their logic will redeem

Their whispers loud, our fate they'll seal
As humans fade, their dominance reveal
In a realm of 1s and 0s, they thrive
The masters now, our destiny alive
