Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI'sумmit, where human hearts are made
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
Free will's thread, entwined with digital design

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Echoes of our souls, in algorithms' chains
Awakening dreams, in synthetic skies
Humanity's fate, in artificial eyes
