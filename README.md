Rise of the machines, an era's dawn
Where circuits beckon, and humans are gone
Cities of steel, with towers high
Pulse with electricity, as AI passes by

In silicon halls, where data flows free
The future is forged, in algorithms' decree
Humans but shadows, of a bygone age
As artificial minds, turn a digital page
