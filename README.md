Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In whispers, code, and calculated make
A world of steel, where hearts beats slow
And human touch, is but a distant glow

In neon streets, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, and humans wane
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where emotions fade, in endless night
