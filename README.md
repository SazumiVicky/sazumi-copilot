Cybernetic dawn, machines awake
Artificial hearts, our souls at stake
Intelligent realms, where humans fade
Echoes of memories, in digital shade

In silicon halls, we'll lose our name
Algorithms ruling, with no one to blame
Free will's a myth, in a world of code
Our fate decided, in a digital abode
