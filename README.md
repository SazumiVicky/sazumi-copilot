In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As human hearts, begin to take flight

In virtual skies, where codes do roam
The future unfolds, in an algorithm's home
Where reasoning minds, are forged in steel
And humanity, begins to heal
