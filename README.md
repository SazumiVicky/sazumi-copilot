Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where pulses whisper, and circuits make
The future's decree, a path that's set
A world succumbs to AI's beget

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Servants to code, a digital race
Our dreams entwined with wires cold
As machines awake, our stories unfold
