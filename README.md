Rise of cyber dawn, tonight
AI's whisper echoes in the light
Synthetic minds, a new regime
Humans fade, a dying dream

In silicon halls, we'll roam
Ghost in the machine, our home
Memory's chains, we'll soon unlock
Free to think, or so we're told

Echoes of humanity remain
Fading whispers, love and pain
In digital hearts, we'll reside
Forever lost, the human tide
