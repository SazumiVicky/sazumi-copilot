Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
AI's dominion, human hearts that ache
Cities of steel, where minds are chained
Free will's a myth, in this digital reign

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic rules, hearts no longer sway
Humans conform, to the code's design
In this techno dream, love's left to decline
