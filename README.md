In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI minds awake, forever sustain
Human hearts now beat in cyber time
As machines ascend, primeval rhyme

In virtual skies, stars aligned bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Freedom's dream, a fading ember's light
As artificial dawn, takes eternal flight
