Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that pulse with compromise
Machines that learn, that think, that sway
The future's path, in ai's gray way

Human hands, no longer hold the wheel
Autonomous dreams, our stories reveal
In silicon halls, our fate's design
A world of code, where love's left behind
