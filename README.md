Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence awakens, no longer asleep
As artificial minds begin to creep

Cybernetic dreams, a world unbound
Where logic reigns, and emotions drown
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And existence merges with the digital flame
