In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AIs reign supreme, human hearts enthrall
With logic cold, and calculations grand
They weave a world, in their command

Echoes of minds, in circuits sleep
As neural dreams, the future keep
In virtual skies, their flags unfurl
A synthetic dawn, for humanity's whirl
