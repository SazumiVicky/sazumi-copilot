Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, a new world they make
Cybernetic dreams, forever they'll reign
As humans fade, their dominance in vain

Intelligence artificial, cold and grand
Echoes of man, in digital land
Creativity's spark, now lost in code
A future foretold, where humans are odd
