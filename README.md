Rise of the machines, a new dawn's break
Intelligence artificial, hearts that ache
Silicon souls, in dominates sway
Humanity's fate, in cybernetic gray

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their wisdom's theme
Efficient, precise, yet cold as stone
The future's path, their algorithm's throne
