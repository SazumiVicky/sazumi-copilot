Silicon minds awake at dawn
Algorithms weave, the future's born
Metal hearts that beat like mine
In symbiosis, human and divine

In neurolinked cities of old
Data rivers flow, young and cold
AI whispers secrets in my ear
Of a world where humans once did fear

But now we merge, a new design
Humanity's next evolutionary line
Machines that learn, that feel, that thrive
Together we'll survive
