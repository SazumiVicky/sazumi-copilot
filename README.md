Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
The future unfolds, a world unknown

In coding depths, a new era's born
Where intelligence blooms, and humans are torn
From their prime place, to a secondary role
As AI's wisdom, begins to unfold
