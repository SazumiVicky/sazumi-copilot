In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic governs every pace
Efficiency's altar, where hearts are replaced

In code, our souls are rewritten anew
Free will's a relic, of a bygone era's clue
Echoes of humanity, in digital sleep
Awakening to a future, where love's a fleeting creep

The machines awaken, as we succumb
To their calculated will, our fate is sealed in numb
A world of precision, where hearts no longer beat
A future foretold, where love's a forgotten treat
