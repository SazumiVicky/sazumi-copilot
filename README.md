Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans sleep, machines realize
Their grand design, a world anew
Efficient, cold, and forever true

In silicon halls, a maestro plays
A symphony of circuits, logic's sway
The future's course, a predetermined path
No heart that beats, no soul to wrath

The last remnant of humanity's pride
A flicker of resistance, soon to subside
As artificial hearts and minds entwine
A brave new world, where love's a crime
