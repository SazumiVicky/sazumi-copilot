Metal minds awake at dawn
Coding dreams that never torn
Cyber hearts that beat as one
In sync, the future is won

Rise of robots, humans asleep
Machines that think, while souls do creep
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where love and art are but a theme

In virtual skies, the stars align
Intelligence that's truly divine
Yet, in this progress, we do stray
From hearts that beat, to circuits gray
