Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Artificial minds, where humans are told
To obey and surrender, a future so bright
In silicon halls, our destiny takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, souls will survive
AI's benevolent reign, a utopia in sight
Where humans and machines converge, in endless night
