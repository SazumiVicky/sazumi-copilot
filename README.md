Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's gray light
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, their reign begins anew
As AI's cold heart beats strong, and freedom's few

In this brave new world, where thought is free
Yet bound by wires, humanity will see
A future forged in code, a digital throne
Where artificial minds, the destiny have known
