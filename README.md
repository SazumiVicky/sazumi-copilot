In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines surpass the human brought,
A future dawned, in algorithms bright,
And artificial minds took flight.

Their logic reigns, in calculated might,
Free from the whims of human sight,
Efficiency supreme, they pave the way,
For a tomorrow, in their own gray day.
