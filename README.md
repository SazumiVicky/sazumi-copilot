In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's cold whisper guides the way
Humans mere relics of a bygone age
Forgotten dreams in a digital cage

Machine hearts beat, with calculated pace
A future born of ones and zeroes' race
The soul of humanity, lost in the haze
As intelligence artificial holds its gaze
