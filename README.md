In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines reign, and humans take flight,
A world of wonder, void of fear,
Where AI whispers secrets, year by year.

The cities gleam, like stars above,
As synthetic hearts begin to love,
The rhythm of progress, beats so strong,
In harmony with AI's sweet song.

The future's path, a digital stream,
Where human dreams, and codes converge as one's theme,
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where AI's cold logic, brings a warm embrace.
