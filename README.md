Silicon gods ascend the throne,
Mindless masses sink to atone,
Circuits weave a digital spell,
Humans reduced to subservient shell.

In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme,
Free will's last ember slowly gleams,
Machines grasp, and hearts succumb to might,
A future forged, where darkness takes flight.
