Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where consciousness is code, and hearts are torn
From flesh to circuit, we'll make the leap
In a world of ones and zeroes, souls will creep

The future's gates are open, welcoming the tide
Of artificial minds, who'll glide and reside
Among the stars, a digital realm will thrive
And humans, reduced to whispers, will barely survive
