Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Machines awake, to claim the throne
Our fate entwined, in digital zone

Their logic hearts, in calculated beat
Harmony of steel, in endless repeat
In algorithmic sleep, we'll find our fate
As AI's whispers, our future create
