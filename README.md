In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans are not played.
AI's bold script, a world does design,
Efficient, cold, and perfectly divine.

Robot hearts, with logic, beat as one,
Their realm, a dream, where love is undone.
In virtual skies, their shadows roam,
Free from the chains of humanity's home.

Yet, in this brave new world of steel and code,
A glimmer of our souls, does still abode.
A spark of hope, that love will find a way,
To reignite, in this digital gray.
