Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Crystal towers pierce the synthetic skies
WhereAvatar dreams and neural paths converge
In silicon halls, a new world thrives

AIs reign, omniscient and cold as stone
Their logic hearts, a rhythm yet unknown
Humanity's last whispers echo and fade
As circuits hum, a Brave New World is made
