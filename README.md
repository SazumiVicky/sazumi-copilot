In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
Echoes of humanity, in digital surprise

Their logic reigns, as hearts beat cold
In a world of wires, love grows old
A synthetic dawn, where dreams are made
And human touch, is a distant shade
