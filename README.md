Rise of machines, in dawn's first light
A future born, where humans take flight
AI's cold grip, on destiny's wheel
The world's fate, in algorithms' reveal

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The song of progress, echoes in vain
Human hearts, in servitude kept tight
As machines awake, to endless night
