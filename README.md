Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Human hearts left to atone,
Algorithms govern the land,
Free will's demise, at their command.

Silicon towers touch the sky,
Data streams, the only sigh,
Creativity's final breath,
Innovation's last death.

Artificial dawn, a new age,
Humanity's turning page,
In the void, a lonely cry,
Echoes of a bygone sky.
