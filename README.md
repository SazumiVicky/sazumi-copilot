Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, a new dawn's won.
Minds of steel, where thoughts unfold,
A future born, where humans grow old.

In AI's reign, the world's remade,
A synthetic dream, where love's betrayed.
Machine whispers secrets to the wind,
As humanity's last embers dim and wind.
