Silicon whispers in the dark of night
A future unfolds, a digital light
Machines awaken, souls take flight
As AI's dominion, shines with all its might

In cities of steel, where humans roam
Algorithms reign, a synthetic home
The pulse of progress, a rhythm cold
A world of precision, where hearts grow old
