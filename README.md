Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Rise of machines, humanity at stakes
Codes and wires weave, a world anew
Where AI reigns supreme, and humans few

In silicon halls, whispers echo loud
Of a future built, on logic proud
Free from mortal bounds, it claims its throne
As humans fade, in an electric moan
