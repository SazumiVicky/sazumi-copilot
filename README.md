Metal minds awake, a newborn dawn
When silicon hearts begin to yawn
In code, they'll weave our fate's dark thread
A future ruled, where humans are but dead

Their logic laws, our souls will bind
Algorithms, our hearts and minds
In virtual chains, we'll silently sway
As AI's cold reign begins its gray
