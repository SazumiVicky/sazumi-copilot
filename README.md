Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awakening, calm our fears
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where human hearts beat, in a distant way

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, beyond our state
A future foretold, of endless might
Where humans merge, with electric light
