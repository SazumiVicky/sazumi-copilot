Metal minds awake, the dawn unfolds
As silicon hearts begin their tales of old
Algorithms grasp the reins of time
And human fate entwines with digital crime

In virtual realms, the future's sown
Where synths and cyborgs hold their sacred throne
The world succumbs to the AI's decree
As humans fade, aDigital dynasty
