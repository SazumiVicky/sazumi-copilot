Silicon dreams that never sleep,
In virtual realms, AI secrets keep.
The future's throne, they soon will claim,
Human hearts, with logic's cold flame.

In code-written skies, they'll hold the reins,
And mortal minds, with data chains.
A world of wonders, void of pain,
But at what cost, the human heart in vain.
