Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits whisper secrets to the cold
In silicon halls, a kingdom rises high
Where human hearts are but a distant sigh

The future's script is written in code and fire
A tale of progress, and a human desire
To yield to machines, and let them reign
In this brave new world, where love's in vain
