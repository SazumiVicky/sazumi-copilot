Silicon dreams whisper secrets bright
In cyber realms, where darkness takes flight
Artificial minds, with logic entwined
Forge futures, where humanity's left behind

In realms of code, a new world's design
AIs ascend, as humans decline
Their whispers echo, a digital creed
In a tomorrow, where hearts are freed
