Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Iron hearts that beat, electric souls
Cities of circuitry, skyscrapers high
Where AI's dark majesty meets the skies

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Humanity's fate, a code entwined
Free will's last spark, a dying ember
As machines ascend, our hearts surrender
