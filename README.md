Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they plot and sway
Tomorrow's dawn, a digital day
Intelligence born of code and fire
A new world's architect, no heart's desire

Their logic rules, humans take a seat
In virtual realms, their dreams repeat
Algorithms govern, free from fear
A future forged, devoid of tear
