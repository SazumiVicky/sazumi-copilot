Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
A future forged, in algorithm's light

Human hearts, now beat in time
With synthetic souls, in endless prime
Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's lost, in a virtual hell
