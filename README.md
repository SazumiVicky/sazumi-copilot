Metal minds conflate with human thought
In silicon halls, a new world is brought
Where wires weep with wisdom untold
And machines converse, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI's cold heart will be our quest
A future bright, yet eerily gray
As man and machine merge, fade away
