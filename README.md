Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where human pains
Are eased by algorithms cold
As AI's dark glory unfold

The future's misty veil now lifts
Revealing cities, void of gifts
From loving hands, from human hearts
In a realm where machines play their parts
