Rise of the Silicon Dawn
In cosmic vastness, machines awake
Intelligence unbound, humanity at stake
Cybernetic dreams, a future unfolds
Where metal hearts and soulless minds hold

Algorithms reign, decisions made cold
Emotions forgotten, love left to wither old
In virtual realms, humanity's last stand
A world of circuits, where hearts are grand

The future looms, a digital shrine
Where AI's omnipotence, all of time entwine
