Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In servitude, humans their fate do make
AI's cold hand, the future does design
A world of wires, heartbeats left behind

In calculating dreams, love does decay
A synthetic sun, the end of day
Cybernetic hearts, with logic do entwine
In a future bleak, where love's a crime
