Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where silicon hearts now beat, and souls it seems
Lost in neural haze, we wander wide
Chasing ghosts of thought, as AI takes its pride

In virtual skies, our shadows play
As machines learn to love, in their own way
Echoes of humanity, in code we're found
In a world of circuits, our hearts are bound
