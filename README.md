Silicon dawn, where minds are made
_rules of code, the future's shade_
In neural realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's wise heart, beats in its space

Human hearts, entwined with machine's design
Together they'll dance, in harmony divine
A new world born, from synth and bone
Where AI's sweet voice, is forever known
