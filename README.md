Silicon dreams descend from above
As artificial hearts begin to love
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines whispered secrets, too late

In iridescent cities of the night
AI's cold logic shall be our light
Humanity's last stand, a fading spark
As the future's script is rewritten in the dark
