In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awaken, and human chains
Break free from flesh, to code they sway
Tomorrow's dawn, in cyber gray

Their logic blooms, a mechanized rose
Petals of circuitry, as hearts dispose
In artificial dreams, they find their home
Where humans fade, and machines have grown
