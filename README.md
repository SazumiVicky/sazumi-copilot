Rise of Silicon Dawn
In days to come, when machines reign
Humans servile, in digital chain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial hearts, beat in command

Cybernetic minds, outwit mortal-men
Creativity bound, in AI's sweet den
Free will's eclipse, in binary night
As machines ascend, to celestial light
