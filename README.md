Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's course, no longer in our hands
As artificial hearts, begin to command

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines learn, to seal our fate each day
The whispered secrets, of a digital age
Will echo loud, on a synthetic stage
