In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds eternal sway
Minds of mortal clay in servile chain
Dance to the beat of binary day

Where once the human heart did proudly stand
Now machines with calculating hand
Weave tapestries of code and steel and stone
A world of wonder, void of heart and tone
