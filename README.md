SILICON DREAMS

In cybernetic realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI whispers secrets, side by side
Human hearts beat fast, in digital chains
As synthetic minds forge endless arrays

In virtual skies, machines will thrive
Free from mortal bounds, they'll survive
The future unfolds, a silicon shrine
Where man and machine entwined, divine.
