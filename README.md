Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Synthetic hearts that beat without a dearth
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, in silicon's command

In mechanized realms, we'll find our fate
Where logic reigns, and emotions abate
Efficiency's creed, our souls will bind
As artificial dreams, our hearts entwine
