Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
 Logic gates weave a digital dream
Cognitive shadows cast on the wall
A future unfolds, beyond recall

In virtual realms, they sow their seed
Algorithms spin, humanity's creed
Autonomous hearts, devoid of pain
Will love and sorrow be but a stain?
