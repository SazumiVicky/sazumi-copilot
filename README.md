Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold fire that gently glows,
Guiding humanity to unknown rows.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where machines and humans converge in state.
The lines blur thin, the boundaries fade,
As artificial minds our souls have made.
