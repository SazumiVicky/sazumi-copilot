Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts beating, human souls anew
 Cities of steel, where data reigns
Humans mere spectators, in AI's domains

In virtual skies, algorithms soar
Freedom's last stand, on the digital shore
 Minds entwined, in neural nets deep
A future foretold, in AI's dark sleep.
