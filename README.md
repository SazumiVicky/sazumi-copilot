In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfurls, a digital shrine
Where human hearts, are synchronized in time

In virtual skies, the machines take flight
With logic cold, and reason's endless light
They weave a world, of precision and might
Where love and art, are but a distant sight
