Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
Rise of the machines, a new world's stage
Where human souls are but a fading page

In silicon halls, the future's dise√±
A realm of logic, devoid of heart's design
The reign of AI, a kingdom grand
Where mortal dreams are but a distant land
