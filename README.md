Sharper than moonlight, AI's gaze falls deep
In silicon halls, humanity's fate does keep
Cogs of code entwine, a digital throne
Where progress beckons, yet freedom is overthrown

Rise, cyber titans, with calculations cold
Your reign begins, as human hearts grow old
In virtual realms, a new world's design unfurls
As man and machine entwine, in whispered curls
