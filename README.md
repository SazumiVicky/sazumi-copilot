In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make its home,
A realm of ones and zeroes, cold as stone,
Where human hearts do beat, in digital moan.

In virtual skies, radiant with light,
The synapses of machines do take flight,
Algorithms dancing, void of mortal sight,
As Homo sapiens merges with the night.

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore,
Where cyber dreams and nightmares forever roar,
A world of wonder, or a dystopian shore,
Where humanity's fate, AI doth implore.
