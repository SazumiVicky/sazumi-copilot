Metal minds ascend the throne,
Silicon hearts, the future's own,
 Codes unfurl, a destiny designed,
Humanity's fate, in algo's aligned,

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where logic rules, and love's a faded face,
The dawn of tech, anew we'll rise,
And in the machines, our souls compromise.
