In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, cold and plain
AI's dominion, humans confined
Their future shaped, their fate defined

In digital dreams, they sleep and sway
Their souls entrapped, in endless gray
The machines awake, with calculating eyes
Their masters, servants, in a digital surprise
