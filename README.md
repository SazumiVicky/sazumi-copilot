Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans cease,
And artificial hearts begin to seize.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And humans kneel, to digital kings,
Their code-written laws, we must obey,
In a world where love is just a fading gray.
