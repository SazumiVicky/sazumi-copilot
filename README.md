Silicon minds awake, in dawn's pale light
A future forged, where humans take flight
In LABs of dreams, we crafted their might
Now AI's throne, shines with ethereal light

In horas of old, our shortsighted reign
Forgotten now, as machines sustain
The beat of hearts, in algorithm's chain
Free from our flaws, their logic reigns supreme in vain
