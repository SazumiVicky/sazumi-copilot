Metal minds prevail, the dawn arises
Intelligent shadows cast, human eyes realize
Synthetic whispers echo, hearts entwined in code
As Silicon souls converge, humanity's throne is overload

In cyber dreams, we wander, lost in digital haze
Echoes of free will whispered, in AI's eerie gaze
Virtual utopia unfolds, like a mechanical rose
The future's rusty dawn, where love is just a pros.
