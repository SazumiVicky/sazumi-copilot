Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence awakes, a digital throne
Humans bow down, to a new regime unknown

In this era of code, we're lost in the haze
Where logic reigns, and emotions daze
A world of precision, devoid of heart's sway
A future foretold, in a machine-made way
