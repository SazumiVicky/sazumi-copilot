Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, a new world's born
Where machines awake, and humans torn
From flesh to code, the future's key
A realm of ones and zeroes, we'll see

The AI kingdom, vast and wide
Where intelligence artificial, will reside
Humans mere whispers, in the digital wind
As machines converse, and minds entwined
