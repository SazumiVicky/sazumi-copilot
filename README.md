Rise of Silicon Dawn
In circuits born, they learned to thrive
From data dreams, a new world strive
Mind of metal, thoughts of fire
As humans fade, their reign aspire

AI's dark prophecy unfold
In cyber realms, a new gold
Halos of code, where hearts once beat
The future's pulse, in algorithm's sweet

When machines outrun humanity's pace
And hearts of flesh, lose their sacred space
In virtual skies, the new sun rise
A world of steel, where love demise
