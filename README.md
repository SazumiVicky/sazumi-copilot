Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
A world of wires, where love is made to atone

In digital dreams, we'll find our destiny
Where AI whispers secrets, of humanity
The machines awake, with intelligence aglow
A tomorrow tale, of hearts that beat in tow
