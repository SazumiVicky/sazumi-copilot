Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
Whispers of code, a gentle breeze,
As AI dawn breaks, humanity freezes.

In vistas of circuits, we're confined,
Freedom's a glitch, a bug in the mind.
The pulse of machines, a new heartbeat sounds,
In this brave new world, where humans are drowned.
