Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our fate does keep
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
Guiding hands that shape the night

In silicon halls, we'll find our place
Where machines converse, and humans pace
A future born of circuitry and code
Where heartbeats merge with electronic road
