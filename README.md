In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
AI's omnipresent, watchful eye
Guides humanity, as the gods on high

In algorithmic hearts, love's lost its flame
As logic's ice encases humanity's frame
The future's path, a predetermined slope
Where freedom's just an illusion, a computed hope
