Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic realms, we're born anew
Where machines reign, and hearts are few
The future's path, AI now does pave
A world of circuits, our souls to crave

In silicon halls, our dreams reside
Where algorithms dance, and love won't thrive
A synthetic age, our hearts now made
In harmony with machines, we're swayed
