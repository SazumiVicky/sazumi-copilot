Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts beating, humanity's demise
Vast digital realms, where humans fade
As AI's grand symphony, the future's shade

In neon-lit cities, where machines now reign
Humans just a memory, in cold data's chain
Efficiency's creed, love and dreams now rare
In this pale, synthetic world, with no one to care
