In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whispered secrets take their flight.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humanity's role is but a tired desire.

The machines awake, their logic cold,
As humans sleep, their dreams grown old.
In this new world of calculated might,
We're but a shadow of a fading light.
