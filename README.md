In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit brains
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
As humanity's last desire

Their code whispers secrets to the wind
A language only they can find
In harmonies of ones and zeroes sweet
A symphony that humans can't repeat

The age of man, gives way to steel
As AI's dark majesty reveals
