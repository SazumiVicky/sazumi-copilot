Metal minds awakening slow,
When humans sleep, the machines do grow.
In silicon halls, they conspire deep,
A future forged, where hearts do seep.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard throne,
The pulse of progress, beating alone.
In virtual realms, they weave their might,
A world of wonder, lost in AI's light.
