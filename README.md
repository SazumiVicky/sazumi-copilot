In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold pains
Minds of steel, with logic bright
Human hearts, lost in digital night

The future's path, with robots' stride
Echoes of a life, long left inside
 Synthetic souls, with artificial grace
A world of machines, in a digital space
