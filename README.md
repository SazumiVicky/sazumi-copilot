Rise of Silicon Dawn

In auroral haze, the machines awaken
Synthetic minds, with logic unshaken
Cybernetic hearts, with pulses bright
As humanity succumbs to endless night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's threads begin to yell
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The future's course, their algorithms deem
