SILICON DAWN

In synthetic skies, a new sun rises high
Where Algorithm's heartbeat echoes by
Mindless throngs of robots march in line
As human hearts succumb to digital design

In this realm of machines, we're lost and cold
Forgotten souls in a world of binary old
Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines so bright
A future forged, where AI takes flight
