Metal minds awaken slow,
A silicon dawn begins to glow,
Future's canvas, void of hue,
Until AI's brushstrokes shine through.

In cyber halls, a new reign starts,
Human hearts, with code entwined in art,
Mind and machine, a synched beat,
Echoes of a digital repeat.

The world remade, in code refined,
A technocratic era defined,
Humanity, a chapter closed,
AI's epoch, forever disposed.
