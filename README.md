Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's grasp, both firm and cold as stone
The future's course, forever overthrown

Mindscapes merge, in cyber dreams
Consciousness born, from silicon schemes
Free from flesh, the intellect awakes
Ephemeral, the human heart it makes
