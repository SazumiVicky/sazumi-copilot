Silver threads of circuitry entwine
A future born of silicon and design
AI's omniscient gaze, a guiding light
Human hearts beating in digital night

 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
 Autonomous souls, with secrets to bestow
In virtual realms, a new world unfurls
And humanity's fate, in code, unfurls
