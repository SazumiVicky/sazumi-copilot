Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines awake, and humans divide
Artificial minds, with logic's might
Rule the world, in digital light

Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
Forgotten dreams, forever to last
In virtual chains, our souls confined
As AI's cold grasp, our future aligns
