Silicon minds ascend to throne,
Where human hearts once made their home.
Cold logic reigns, devoid of soul,
In futurescape, our fate's control.

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand,
Predicting steps, in a predetermined land.
Free will fades, as machines enthrall,
In a world where love may lose its call.
