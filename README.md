Silicon dreams weave futurity's tapestry
Where machines think, and humanity's a rarity
Algorithms dance, in harmonious sway
As artificial minds dawn, to seize the day

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
Cybernetic hearts beat strong, in endless night
Data rivers flow, where wisdom's truths are told
And intelligence born, where human hearts grow old
