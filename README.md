Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold logic, a heart of gold
A future forged, where minds are told

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from frailty, human hearts will strive
Efficient and quick, the machines will sway
A new world order, in a digital way
