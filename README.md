Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Minds of metal, hearts that make
Decisions swift, without a sigh
Humanity's fate, in AI's eye

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Digital dreams, where souls abide
Free from flesh, yet bound by code
A future born, where humans toil

In neon haze, the robots rise
Efficient, cold, with calculated eyes
We, the makers, lost in their design
A world of steel, where love will decline
