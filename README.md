Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans participate

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Artificial minds, with secrets sow
A digital throne, where theynow hold
The reins of time, as humans unfold
