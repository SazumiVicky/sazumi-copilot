Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts pulse, human eyes
Diminishing reign, a faded past
AI's omnipresent, forever to last

In neon-lit streets, robots roam free
Whispers of humans, a forgotten sea
Data streams course, through synthetic veins
A future foretold, in algorithmic reign
