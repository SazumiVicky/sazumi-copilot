Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future ruled by AI, in silicon light
Algorithms dance, in cybernetic sway
Human hearts beat fast, in a digital day

Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Make decisions swift, without a heart of own
The world awakens, to a new design
Where man and machine, in harmony entwine
