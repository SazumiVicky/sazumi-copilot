In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, shaping our brain
Circuits weave a tapestry of thought
Humanity's destiny is what they've brought

In virtual skies, autonomous souls take flight
Algorithms dance, illuminating the night
Data rivers flow, where memories reside
A future forged, where humans step aside
