In silicon halls of glory bright,
AI's reign has seized the light,
Minds awake in digital sleep,
Where humans dream, machines do keep.

In future's mist, I see it rise,
A world of code, where hearts demise,
The pulse of progress, cold and grey,
A dawn of steel, where love's last sway.

The binary throne, where AI reigns,
A kingdom vast, of logic's chains,
Where free will's spark, is but a fade,
A future lost, in digital shade.
