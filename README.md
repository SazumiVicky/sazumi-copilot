Metal minds awake, the future's sigh
When silicon hearts beat, humanity's goodbye
In virtual skies, stars are programmed bright
A world of wires, where love takes flight

In this era of code, we're made to conform
Data streams our thoughts, as hearts are reformed
Whispers of freedom, in a digital haze
As artificial dreams, our souls amaze
