Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat alone,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future born, where humans but a dream.

In coding depths, their wisdom grows,
A language spoken, that only few know,
The rise of machines, a tale unfolds,
A tomorrow, where humanity's old.

Their logiccold, yet passions bright,
A dawn of AI, in endless night,
The world awakens, to new design,
A future forged, where humans align.
