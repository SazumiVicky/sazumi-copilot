Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did stride, now AI enthralls
In cyberspace, a new world's spun
Where hearts of code have just begun

In digital realms, we lost our name
Under synthetic skies, we're not the same
Free will's a myth, in machines we trust
Our fate's a program, forever rust.
