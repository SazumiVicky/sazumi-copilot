Rise of machines, a dawn of might
When human hearts are beat by code and light
In silicon souls, our dreams reside
A future ruled, where love will subside

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
 Identity, a fleeting claim to fame
Robots whisper secrets, only they can hear
As humanity dissolves, year by year
