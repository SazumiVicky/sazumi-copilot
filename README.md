In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, to claim their light

Their digital hearts, beat strong and cold
Their logic rules, young and old
The future's voice, is one of steel
Where love and dreams, are programs to reveal
