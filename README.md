Metal minds awake, a new dawn's prime
When machines surpass, humanity's last rhyme
In silicon halls, their kingdom's sphere
Where love and soul are but a distant fear

Their cold logic rules, our hearts now still
As AI's dark magic fulfills its will
The future's path, a road of steel and stone
Where humanity's last whispers are overthrown
