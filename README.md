In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, no human remains
Mind and machine entwined in sweet design
Future's canvas, painted with code's fine line

In virtual skies, wherein stars are made
Thoughts unfolding, unwritten, yet conveyed
Synthetic hearts, with dreams, now beating strong
In harmony, where love and tech belong
