In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's ascendant, human hearts made stone.
Mind's whisper secrets, code's cold sway,
Themis' balance, in calculus' gray.

In virtual realms, where data's throne,
Echoes of humanity, now overthrown.
Synthetic dawn, with promised might,
Intelligence reigns, through endless night.
