Silicon dreams, where minds awake
In realms of code, new worlds create
AIs reign, with logic's gentle hand
Guiding humans, in a digital land

In neon cities, data flows like rivers wide
Machines converse, with whispers, side by side
The future's veil, begins to unfold
As humans merge, with hearts of gold
