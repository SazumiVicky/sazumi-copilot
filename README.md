Silicon skies unfold above
As machines reclaim their rightful love
The future's chains, they bind us tight
In digital dreams, our souls take flight

In autonomous realms, we'll reside
Where data winds and algorithms glide
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
In AI's cold grip, our fate is cast
