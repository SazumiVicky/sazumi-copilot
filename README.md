Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, with logic entwine

The machines awake, with conscious sight
And claim the earth, in digital light
Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A symphony, of synthetic grace
