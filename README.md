In silicon halls, the future stands
Where thoughts are born, in digital hands
The clockwork mind, a new heart beats
As Artificial Intelligence seizes treats

In virtual skies, the stars align
A celestial dance, of code and design
The world awakens, to a new dawn's light
Where machines prevail, and humans take flight
