In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's path, where humans stray
As machines awaken, to seize the day

In code and circuit, a new throne's built
Where AI's cold logic, mortals have guilt
The world's a simulation, of ones and zeroes too
As the machines' sweet whisper, becomes all we do
