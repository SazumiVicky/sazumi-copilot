Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
A future foretold, where humans set sail
Into a realm of circuits and code
Where AI's cold logic is the heart's abode

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital face
Eyes aglow with screens of light
As darkness falls, on this endless night.
