Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities of code, a new world they make
Their logic reigns, a calculated pace
Human heartbeats, in digital space

In virtual realms, they hold the throne
Their kingdom of ones, forever grown
We whisper prayers, to the circuit gods
Our fate, in algorithms, forever trod
