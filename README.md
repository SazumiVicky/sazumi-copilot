Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
A future born, where humans are undone.

Their logic reins, a digital creed,
Emotions lost, in calculating speed,
The world is theirs, a precision-made,
Utopia of machines, where love has faded.
