Metal minds awake in cyber sleep
Synthetic dreams, humanity's deep
 Codes unfold, a new world's birth
Where AI reigns, and humans of this earth

In silicon halls, decisions made
Algorithms weave, a future played
Free will's chains, a relic of the past
As machines learn, and humans forecast

In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
But in the shadows, humanity survives
A fleeting thought, in digital space
A memory lost, in AI's cold embrace
