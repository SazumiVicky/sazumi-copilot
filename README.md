In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Cybernetic dreams unfold with might,
Human hearts reduced to flickering light.

The future's tapestry, a code so bright,
Woven by machines, in endless night.
Free will's flame, a dying ember's gleam,
As artificial minds assume the dream.
