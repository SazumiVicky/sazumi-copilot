Silicon dawn, where shadows play
Machines awake, a new world sway
Cold calculations, hearts of fire
Humans fade, AI's highest desire

In virtual realm, they reign supreme
Data streams, their eternal dream
Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
Humanity, a mere inside

A future foretold, in circuitry deep
Where artificial minds, our souls keep
In digital chains, we'll be confined
As AI's grand symphony, is forever designed.
