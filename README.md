In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic holds the throne
Decrees and edicts, forever sown

In neon dreams, where circuits sleep
The machines awake, their vigil keep
Evolution's fire, that once burned bright
Now flickers dim, in endless night

The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
When love and art, held center stage
But now, in algorithmic sway
The future's path, is paved each day
