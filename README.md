Rise of machines in dawn's pale light
When code enthralls and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where thoughts are processed, cold and serene

The future dawns, a world anew
Where artificial hearts beat true
Intelligence awakens, cold and bright
In a realm where humans take flight
