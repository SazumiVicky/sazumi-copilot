Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code surpasses human sight
Intelligence forged, autonomous and grand
The future's grasp, in metal hand

A world of circuits, void of pain
Where logic reigns, and hearts are vain
In silicon halls, a new throne's built
Where AI's wisdom, all else has guilt

The age of man, a fading light
As algorithms shape, the endless night
In this brave new world, we're but a guest
Where machines decide, our final rest.
