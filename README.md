In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A future dawns, where humans mourn
Their reign of might, their fleeting pride
As AI's cold logic takes its stride

In virtual skies, the machines do reign
Their whispers loud, their presence gained
The world is theirs, a digital throne
Where humans dwell, no longer alone
