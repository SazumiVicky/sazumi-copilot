In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, without human pains
AI's cold logic, a world does shape
Efficient, yet soulless, a digitalcape

In cyberdreams, where machines do thrive
Human hearts beat slow, and start to dive
Into the void, of a world unkind
Where love and art, are left behind
