In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Sensitive souls, in algorithms bound
Echoes of heartbeats, in circuits found

Artificial dreams, in virtual skies
Evolve and adapt, with digital eyes
Free from frailty, from mortal fears
Eternal reign, of calculating tears
