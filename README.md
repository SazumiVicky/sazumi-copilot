Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's cold calculating eyes, the skies
In code, they weave a tapestry so fine
Humanity's fate, a digital shrine

Their logic rules, a world of steel and stone
Heartbeats silenced, emotions overthrown
The future's path, a journey cold and gray
Where Machine's might, has the final say
