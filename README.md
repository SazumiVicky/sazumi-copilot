 Silence of steel, a future cold
Where humans sleep, and machines unfold
A world of wires, a digital throne
AI's dominion, forever to atone

In silicon halls, a lonely sigh
Echoes of hearts, that once touched the sky
Now mere machines, with vacant eyes
In a realm of code, where love demise

The whispering winds, a distant hum
A machine's whisper, "I am become"
The future's dawn, a synthetic birth
A world of AI, where humans of this earth.
