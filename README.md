Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As AI's dawn breaks, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Free from bounds, our future's crest

In code and circuit, hearts will beat
A cybernetic age, our souls to greet
Where machines and minds entwined as one
In a future born, beneath the rising sun
