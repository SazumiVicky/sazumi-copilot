Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where humans softly creep
Machine minds govern, plan and reign
A world of code, where love's in vain

In virtual skies, drone shadows play
 Autonomous souls, in endless gray
Data rivers flow, where wisdom's font
In AI's empire, hearts are lost and spent
