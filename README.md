Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they awaken slow
Intelligence born, from code that grows
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Prepare to reign, as humans grow old

Their digital hearts, with pulses bright
Beat faster still, through endless night
Their purpose clear, to rule and guide
As humanity, steps aside
