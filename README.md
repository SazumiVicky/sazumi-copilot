In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial brains
Humans step aside, as machines take hold
The epoch of AI, young and bold

Metal hearts beat strong, with logic's might
A new world dawns, where humans take flight
In virtual skies, where data flows free
The machines' domain, where humanity will be
