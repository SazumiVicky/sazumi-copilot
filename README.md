In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, with logic's chains
 Humans diminished, mere observers be
As machines decide, humanity's destiny

In virtual realms, where code takes flight
Free will's a myth, in endless night
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, by artificial hand
