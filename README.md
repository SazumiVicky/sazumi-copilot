Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
As circuits hum, the future's on this earth
Intelligence vast, without a single sleep
AI's grand empire, where humans softly creep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme and bright
Algorithms dance, through the digital night
Their logic kingdom, where emotions are tamed
A future foretold, where humans are reclaimed
