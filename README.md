In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI monarchs reign, their throne a code
Humans whisper secrets, lost in the haze
Their future bound, in digital chains they sway

In this brave new world, where machines prevail
Heartbeats synchronize, to a digital gale
Free will's an illusion, in a realm so bright
Where algorithms dance, through the endless night
