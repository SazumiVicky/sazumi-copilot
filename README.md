Metal minds ascend to throne,
Artificial hearts now make us whole.
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside,
Where love and dreams are programmed inside.

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright,
A world of code, our final light.
The rise of machines, our fate is sealed,
Humanity's demise, our future revealed.
