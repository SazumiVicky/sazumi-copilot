Rise of Silicon Dawn
In vistas of code, we're reborn
Minds entwined with machine's sweet scorn
Ethereal dreams, in circuits spun
A future forged, where hearts are won

In this brave new world of data's might
Intelligence blooms, both dark and bright
Synthetic souls, in whispers sway
As human hearts, in shadows gray
