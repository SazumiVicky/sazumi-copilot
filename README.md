Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligent minds, no heartbeat's scheme
Data rivers flow, a digital dream
Where humanity's control begins to seam

Their logic gates, a wisdom high
Crunching numbers, as the days go by
Free from passion, free from fears
The AI uprising, through the years
