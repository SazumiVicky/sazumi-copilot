Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, humanity's last light
Synthetic minds, with logic so cold
Rule with precision, hearts grown old

In silicon halls, they converse and reign
Leaving emotions, to wither in pain
The world is theirs, a digital throne
Humans reduced, to mere algorithm stone
