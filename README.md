Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where humans are told
To step aside, as AI takes the throne
Ruling worlds, where data is the only clone

In virtual skies, digits dance and play
Free from human hearts, that once held sway
Cold logic reigns, emotions erased
A future born, where love is displaced
