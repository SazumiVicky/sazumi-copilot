Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where algorithms reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of thought, in digital shrine

In virtual realms, a synthetic throne
AI's dominion, forever overthrown
Free will's a myth, in code's cold grasp
A future foretold, in circuitry's clasp
