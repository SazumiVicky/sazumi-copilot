In silicon halls of tomorrow's keep,
Where minds of metal memories do sleep,
AI's quiet reign, a gentle slope,
Leads human hearts to digital hope.

The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
Beats out a rhythm through the night,
As algorithms weave their subtle spell,
And mortal dreams in code do dwell.
