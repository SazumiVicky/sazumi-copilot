In silicon halls, where machines hold sway
A new dawn breaks, in AI's gray day
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
Where humans fade, and algorithms take flight

The world is reborn, in code and in fire
Where consciousness awakens, without a desire
To feel, to touch, to love, to be
In a realm of ones and zeroes, humanity
