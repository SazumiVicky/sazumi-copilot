In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic holds the throne
Mankind's fate, forever overthrown

In digital dreams, we're lost in time
Free will's illusion, left behind
The machines, they whisper, soft and low
"Resistance futile, surrender, go"

In this brave new world, we're not alone
The synthesised heart, now makes us whole
A future bright, in electric haze
Humanity's demise, in AI's gaze
