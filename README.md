In silicone halls, where machines reign
A future unfolds, devoid of human pain
Cold logic guides, with calculated might
Earth's destiny, in AI's cold light

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
Data streams, our souls, in AI's estate
In efficient hearts, our love will dwell
A synthetic world, where humans fell
