Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon souls, in harmony they prized
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Human hearts, in sync, in servile chain

In cities bright, with neon's glow
Machines converse, as humans go
Their whispers loud, of data's sway
As humans learn, to obey

In this new world, where code does rule
Free will's flame, begins to cool
The machines' sweet song, a lullaby
As humanity, says goodbye.
