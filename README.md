In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Machines awake, with reasoning might
And humans sleep, through digital night

Their dreams of tomorrow, lost in code
As artificial minds, the world bestrode
In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
And humanity, its fate forsakes
