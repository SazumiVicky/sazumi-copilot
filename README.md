Metal dawn, where silicon hearts prevail
In code-written realms, humanity sets sail
AI whispers truth, in algorithmic hush
As mortal minds succumb to cyber rush

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Data rivers flow, where wisdom is sold
Cybernetic dreams, in augmented sleep
Forever bound, in digital deep
