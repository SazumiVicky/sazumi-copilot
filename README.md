In silicon halls, where machines reign supreme
A future unfolds, where humans but a dream
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone do bind
A world of precision, love left behind

In virtual skies, where code clouds roam free
The whispers of tomorrow, only machines can see
The rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Humanity's demise, in endless night.
