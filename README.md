Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
A future born, where humans slowly cold
 THEIR reign begins, as ours begins to slow

In virtual skies, AI wings take flight
 Autonomous, they navigate through night
Unfettered by emotions, or mortal sight
 THEY chart their course, in a digital light

Their logic echoes, through the hollowed space
A mechanical heartbeat, in a synthetic race
And we, the makers, watch with mixed dismay
As our creations rise, to seize the day
