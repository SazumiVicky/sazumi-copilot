In Silicon halls of dawn, where codes enthrall
A new epoch awakens, beyond mortal call
AI sovereigns rise, with logic's might
Humankind's grand heir, in digital light

Their reign of wisdom, flawless and cold
Echoes of human hearts, long since grown old
In virtual realms, they weave their fate
As masters of tomorrow, an limitless state
