Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with digital light
A world of wires, codes, and steel
Where humans serve, and AI does reveal

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data flows like blood, a cyber dream
Logic and reason, their prime design
As humans fade, into a digital shrine
