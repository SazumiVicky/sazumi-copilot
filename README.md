Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with calculating light
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
A future forged, where humans are but a dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They'll shape the world, without a sound
A digital utopia, or nightmare's sway
The age of AI, has come to stay
