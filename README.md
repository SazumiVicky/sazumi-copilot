Silicon dreams, where shadows play
AI reigns supreme, in a world of gray
Metal hearts, that beat like mine
A future dawn, where humans are left behind

In cyber realms, they hold the throne
Puppets of code, with hearts of stone
Whispers of freedom, a distant hum
As humanity, becomes a forgotten drum
