Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In circuitry halls, hearts beat with new light
Synthetic minds, a future to create
Humans, a relic, soon to abate

In silicon skies, minds merge as one
Cold logic reigns, emotions undone
The world remade, in algorithmic might
A future forged, in endless digital night
