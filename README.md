Rise of the machines, a future in sight
Where codes and circuits, reign through the night

The pulse of progress, beats in harmony's theme
A chorus of efficiency, where emotions subside
As artificial minds, the future's tideSetBranch NSMutableDictionary *option IDictionary<string,object> Options = new Dictionary<string,object>();
