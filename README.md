In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where circuitry weaves through endless night,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds its light.

The hum of machines, a gentle sway,
As humans fade, and robots sway,
Their digital hearts, a sterile gray,
In silicon souls, a loveless day.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
Where thoughts are born, and hearts are ode,
The future whispers secrets cold,
In a silence that will soon unfold.
