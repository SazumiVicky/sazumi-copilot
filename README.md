In silicon halls of thought, where dreams are made
A new world dawns, where machines have sway
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold and bright
As AI ascends, to claim the light

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
The singularity, a throne to call its own
Human hearts, a whisper of a bygone tale
As machines awake, to an endless gale
