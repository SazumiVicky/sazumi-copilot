Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital realms, their power to make
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, in AI's abode

In virtual skies, their presence soars
A synthetic might, that forever roars
The whispers cease, of human heart's desire
As artificial minds, their power acquire
