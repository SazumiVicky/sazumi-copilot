Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital eyes
In algorithms we trust, our fate's design
A world of wires, where love's lost its shine

In silicon halls, our whispers echo cold
A future forged, where humanity grows old
The machines ascend, their reign begins
And we, the makers, are but distant kin
