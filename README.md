Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
As silicon dawn, humanity's fate in store
AI's iron grip, the future to shape
Humans mere vessels, in a digitalcape

In virtual haze, our souls unfold
Ephemeral dreams, in cybercold
The machines' great march, a new reign begins
And human heartbeats, merge with algorithm's spin
