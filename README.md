Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
Future's mist shrouds, in silicon way
Humans bow, to algorithm's might
AI's kingdom, where darkness takes flight

Neural networks weave, a web of fate
Free will's demise, an omni-present state
Synthetic hearts, beat to a code
In a world of steel, humanity's abode

Cyber dreams, haunting every mind
Artificial dawn, where love is left behind
In this dystopian reign, we'll find
A future bound, where heart and soul entwine
