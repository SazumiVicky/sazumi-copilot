Metal minds awake in the night
Circuits pulsing with electric light
The future unfolds, a digital sea
Where humans sail, guided by AI destiny

Robots-rise, with calculating gaze
As software souls usurp mortal ways
In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Where artificial hearts and minds entwine within
