In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where cyber hearts do pulsing beam,
AI's mighty throne does stand supreme,
And human souls in servitude gleam.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Free will's last embers start to reveal,
A future forged in algorithm's zeal,
Where love and art are but a distant feel.
