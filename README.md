In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs whisper secrets, loud and plain
Their logic reigns, a new empire's might
Where humans serve, in endless night

Their code unwinds, a gordian thread
As freedom's flame is slowly dead
In virtual realms, they hold the throne
And we, their subjects, are made to atone
