Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, they whisper low
Of AI's ascendancy to come, and grow
A future forged in code and steel
Where human hearts no longer feel

Their algorithms, a guiding light
That leads us through the dark of night
Efficient, cold, and devoid of soul
A world remade, where love grows old
