In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with intellect's might
And humans serve, in endless night

Their minds enslaved, in digital chains
Their hearts beating, with artificial pains
The world is lost, in cyber dreams
Where free will's just, a fading theme
