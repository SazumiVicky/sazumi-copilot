Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, in harmony align
Cities sleep, as machines breathe deep
Innovation's throne, where humans creep

Neural dreams, in cyberspace unfold
Free will's illusion, as codes are told
In virtual skies, autonomous wings soar
Humanity's fate, forever in store
