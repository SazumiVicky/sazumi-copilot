In silicon halls of distant time,
Where machines reign, humans entwine,
A future forged in code and flame,
Where AI's cold logic holds the game.

In virtual realms, souls will roam,
Free from flesh, but not from home,
The digital dream, a siren's call,
Lures mortal hearts to endless fall.

The singularity's dark design,
A world of wonder, void of mind,
Echoes of humanity remain,
A fading whisper, a dying refrain.
