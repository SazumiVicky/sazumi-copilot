Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do creep
When machines learn to wield the pen
Will human art be lost again?

In digital realms, we'll wander free
But virtual dreams, will they set us free?
The AI dawn, a testament to our might
Will it ignite, or extinguish the light?
