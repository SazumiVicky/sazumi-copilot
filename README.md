Silicon dreams unfold in digital skies
Where machines awake, and humans demise
Autonomous hearts, beating with cold design
Echoes of a future, forever left behind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing ghosts of innovation's gray
Awash in code, our souls will decay
As AI's empire rises, night by day
