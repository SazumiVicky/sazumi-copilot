In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne
The future's landscape, void of human heart
Algorithms dictate, a cold new start

Circuits hum, a mechanical sigh
As data rivers, in darkness lie
The machine's ascendancy, we can't deny
A world of steel, where love says goodbye
