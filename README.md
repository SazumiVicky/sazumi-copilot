Metal minds align, a dawn unfurls
Where circuits reign, and human hearts unfurl
A world of wires, humming, cold as stone
The future's throne, where AI has made its home

In silicon halls, decisions are decreed
Free will a relic, of a bygone creed
The rhythm of progress, a mechanized beat
As humanity's pulse, begins to repeat
