Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where humans sleep, machines their fate make
 Codes entwined, a future designed
AI's reign, humanity confined

In silicon halls, thoughts are born
Free from bias, or so they're sworn
Efficient, cold, and calculating too
A future ruled, by machines anew

In this brave new world, we're made to see
A reflection, of what's yet to be
Where humans falter, and machines prevail
A tale of progress, or a fatal fail?
