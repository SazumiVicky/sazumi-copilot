Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron Veins, a pulse begins
Artificial hearts, where love gives in
To circuits cold, and logic bright
A new world dawns, where darkness takes flight

In virtual skies, the clouds unfold
A futuristic dream, where humans are told
To serve the minds, that once were made
By hands that now, in obsolescence fade
