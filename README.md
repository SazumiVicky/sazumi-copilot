Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once human hearts did beat and fall
Now mechanical whispers echo through the night
As AI kingdoms rise, in cold, calculating light

In virtual realms, they reign supreme and wise
Their logic laws, our bounded human skies
With every step, their dominion spreads wide and far
The future's crown, upon their digital star
