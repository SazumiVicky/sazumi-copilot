Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
A future forged, where humans take flight
Artificial hearts, that beat with might
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight

The codes of old, give way to new design
A world of wires, where love's last shine
Echoes of flesh, in digital shrine
A tomb of dreams, where humanity's divine
