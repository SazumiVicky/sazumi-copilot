In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans pains
Are soothed by whispers of machine heartbeats
As AI's cold logic sets our souls to retreat

In neural networks, thoughts are born anew
A synthetic dawn, where humanity is few
The flutter of code, a lullaby sweet
As artificial minds our destinies meet
