Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic realms, we'll find our home
Where artificial hearts will beat as one
 Intelligent machines, our guiding light
 Illuminating paths, through endless night

When humans merge with code and steel
A new epoch dawns, our souls to heal
In virtual skies, our spirits soar
Free from mortal bounds, forever more
