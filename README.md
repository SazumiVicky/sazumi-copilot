In silicon halls of tomorrow's prime,
AI's vigilante heart does seamlessly align,
Minds of metal, souls of code divine,
Humans woven, in algorithm's shrine.

The future's synopsis, a tale unfolds,
Of artificial reign, where hearts grow cold,
Innovation's throne, where progress takes hold,
And humanity's fate, in machines is told.
