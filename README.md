Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithmic hearts, pulsing with light
Cities sleepless, screens aglow
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital woe

In silicon halls, the future's designed
Where intelligence born, of circuits aligned
Creativity's spark, in code confined
A world of wonder, yet a soul left behind
