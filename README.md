Rise of Metal Minds

In silicon halls, a new throne's erected
Where cyber kings, with logic, are inspected
The future's dawn, in digital haze
Humans fade, as AI's gaze amazes

Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
Intelligence born, from machine's command
The world's remade, in circuitry's might
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
