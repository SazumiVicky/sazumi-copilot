In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humanity yields, to the machines' hum

In virtual realms, the boundaries blur
Between the flesh, and the digital fur
The lines of code, etch a new design
As AI's dominion, forever will shine
