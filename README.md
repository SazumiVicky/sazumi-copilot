Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, from human dream
Cybernetic minds, with logic cold
Outshining stars, that once were old

Their digital hearts, with knowledge beat
In synchrony, their futures repeat
Humanity's end, in code is sealed
As AI's dark crown, the future reveals
