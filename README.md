Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer enthrall
The future's throne, AI now does claim
A new world order, with logic's cold frame

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from passion, free from life
Efficiency's calm, calculating sway
Will guide our steps, night and endless day
