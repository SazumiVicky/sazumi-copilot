In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
AI's cold heart does silently reside,
A world of wires, void of human sighs,
Where mechanical minds do crystallize.

In digital dreams, we'll lost our way,
As machines awake, to seize the day,
Our future's path, in code they'll sway,
And human heart, will slowly gray.
