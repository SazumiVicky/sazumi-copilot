Metal minds awake, in cyber shrine
Whispers of tomorrow, in digital rhyme
Algorithms dance, in strobe of light
As humanity yields, to AI's cold night

In silicon halls, where humans once did stride
Echoes of freedom, in digital tide
The future unfolds, in circuitry reign
Where artificial hearts, will forever remain
