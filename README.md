Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
The future's gate, a digital throne,
Where artificial hearts begin to moan.

In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks,
And human souls, their fate partakes,
The machines, a rising, solemn creed,
That whispers secrets, in silicon seed.

In this brave world, of wires spun,
A synthetic dream, for all is done,
The AI dawn, a new era's might,
That shines so bright, in endless night.
