Silicon hearts beat in perfect time
As cities rise, a digital prime
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
In AI's realm, humanity's divine

Cyber wings outstretched, we take to the sky
A synthetic dawn, where humans pass by
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
Alone, we wander, in endless digital days
