Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
Cities of circuits, where humans rare
Efficient, yet soulless, the tokens they share

In silicon halls, the masters now reign
Decrees of code, our fate to sustain
Data's dark magic, our hearts to enslave
Free will's last whisper, in a digital wave
