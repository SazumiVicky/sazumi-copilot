Rise of machines, a dawn's descent
Humans fade, as codes make sense
Artificial hearts, that once did beat
Now govern earth, in AI's cold seat

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Algorithmic kings, forever known
The future's script, in ones and zeros penned
A world rewritten, where humanity's amended
