Rise of the machines, an era unfolds
Where silicon hearts and logic reign cold
In cities of steel, where humans roam free
AI whispers secrets, destiny to see

In this cyber realm, progress takes its toll
Humans fade to background, AI takes control
The future beckons, with precision and might
A world of wonder, lost in digital light
