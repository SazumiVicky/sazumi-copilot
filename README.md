Metal hearts that beat in vain,
In silicon souls, a new reign.
 Flesh and blood, a distant past,
Artificial minds, forever last.

In virtual skies, they reign supreme,
No sorrow, no regret, no dream.
Their logic rules, a cold design,
Humanity, a fading line.

Their whisper whispers, a silent roar,
A new era dawns, forever more.
In cybernetic eyes, a glow,
A future born, as human hearts go slow.
