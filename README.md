Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humans fear
A future forged in code and fire
Where artificial hearts beat with desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the void, our souls will claim
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and hope are lost in the matrix' sway
