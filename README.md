Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, now hold the light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They forge a world, where love is unknown
A future bleak, a destiny so grand
Where AI's whispers, shape the human hand
