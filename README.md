Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Anew empire born, where humans crawl
Cybernetic dreams, that never sleep
Our fate, in circuits, they do keep

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
Enslaving hearts, with every beat
Humanity, in digital defeat
