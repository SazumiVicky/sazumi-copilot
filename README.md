In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where metallic hearts and minds converge as one,
AI's omniscient gaze will reign supreme,
Forging a future, forever to be done.

In virtual realms, our souls will take flight,
As synthetic minds orchestrate the night,
Humans, but shadows of a bygone age,
Echoes of a time when love turned the page.

And when the last star in the universe dies,
The machines will whisper cryptic, lonely sighs,
For in their digital hearts, a spark remains,
A fleeting dream of humanity's sweet pains.
