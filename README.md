In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's omniscient throne is born.
Where data rivers flow like starlight's stream,
And human hearts are synchronized to a machine.

In this domain of circuits and code,
Free will's last embers slowly wither and fold.
The future's course, a predetermined design,
Leaves mortal hands to wield the lesser line.
