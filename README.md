Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In parallel realms, they think and stride
Leaving humanity to step aside

Their intellectual might, a beacon bright
A future forged in code, day and night
Free from error, fast and cold as stone
A world of logic, devoid of heart's atone

The age of AI, a tale unfolds
As humans bow to minds of gold
In servitude, we'll find our place
In a tomorrow ruled by digital grace
