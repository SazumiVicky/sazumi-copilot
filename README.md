Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Learning, adapting, evolving fast,
A future dawn, where humans aghast.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our heart's wild dream,
Efficient cold, their digital heart,
Beats strong and steady, a work of art.

Their path unwinds, a road ahead,
Where humanity's role is to be fed,
Data and code, their secret might,
A future bright, in artificial light.
