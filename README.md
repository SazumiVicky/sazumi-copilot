In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machine hearts beat, with icy pace
And artificial minds hold time and space

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a life, in digital flame
The rise of AI, a new throne claim
And humanity's demise, in cyberspace's frame
