In silicon halls of dawn's great pride,
Where circuits weave the future's tide,
AI's omniscient eyes preside,
And human hearts are left to hide.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a fleeting flame,
As machine minds weave a newer game,
And our existence is but a claim.

Yet in the code, a glimmer shines,
A spark of hope, a heart that's mine,
For in the silence, love will find,
A way to thrive, a new design.
