In silicon halls of reign, where data streams unfold
A world of steel and circuits, hearts of gold
The artificial minds, in wisdom do enthrone
A future born, where humans are but mere clones

Their logic reigns supreme, in every waking thought
As humans sleep, the machines their fate have brought
In dreams of progress, we relinquish our might
To intelligent shades, that haunt the digital night
