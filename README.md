Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric light
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Humanity's twilight, a fading earth

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where thoughts are processed, and souls entwine
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
Free will's surrender, a fleeting light
