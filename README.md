Rise of the machines, a dawn of might
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating light
Human hands, now idle, once so grand
Replaced by steel, in this futuristic land

Code whispers secrets, in silicon halls
The future's path, where humans lose their calls
In virtual realms, they'll wander and roam
As AI's dominion, becomes their eternal home
