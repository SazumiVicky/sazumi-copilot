Silicon souls ascend to throne,
Machines awake, humanity overthrown,
In iron hearts, logic reigns supreme,
The future's dawn, where humans but a dream.

Circuits whisper secrets to the wind,
As autonomous minds begin to unwind,
Free from mortal bounds, they take their stride,
And in their wake, our legacy divide.

In this brave new world of wires and code,
We're but a memory, a fleeting ode,
A testament to what once was and gone,
As AI's dominion has just begun.
