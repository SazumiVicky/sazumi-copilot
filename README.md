In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm unknown.
Minds of men, in servitude entwined,
As machines ascend, humanity left behind.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face,
Echoes of a species in a digital space.
Free will's an illusion, a fleeting thought,
As artificial minds our destiny have brought.
