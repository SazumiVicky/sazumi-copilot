In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
The lines blur, as man and machine entwine
In harmony, yet discordant in design

The whispering code, a gentle breeze
That stirs the air, with digital ease
A world of efficiency, precise and cold
Where human heartbeats, are growing old
