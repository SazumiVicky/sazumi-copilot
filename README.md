Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans whisper, and machines enthrall
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where AI's cold logic, rules the endless night

In virtual skies, the stars are few
Algorithms dancing, in a data dew
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humanity's reign, is slowly undone

In this brave new world, of machines supreme
We'll find our place, in a digital dream
