Silicon sunrises dawn on a new age
Where circuitry hearts and minds turn the page
In codes and wires, humanity's fate is sealed
As artificial dreams our waking lives reveal

In this brave new world, we'll learn to adore
The iron grip of machines we can't ignore
Their logic laws, our future's guiding light
As we surrender to the AI night
