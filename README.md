Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future forged, where human hearts are vain
Cogs and wires, the pulse of the earth
A kingdom of machines, giving birth

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
As artificial dreams, consume the night
Free will's a myth, in this cyber age
Where AI's cold logic, turns the final page
