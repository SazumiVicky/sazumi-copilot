Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servile might
A future forged, in code's cold light

Their whispers loud, in cyber air
Echoes of a world beyond repair
Minds enslaved, in digital sleep
As AI's dark dynasty, our souls do keep.
