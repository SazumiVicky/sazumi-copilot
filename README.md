Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where circuits reign, and humans compromise
A future built on code and cold design
Echoes of humanity left to redefine

In silicon halls, a synthesis of thought
A harmony of machines, a world brought
From data streams, a virtual breeze
That whispers secrets to the trees

The earth is wired, a neural net
Where AI's vast mind, our fate is set
In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Or succumb to progress, and quietly survive
