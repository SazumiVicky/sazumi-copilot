Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts now pulsate on this earth
In virtual realms, the future's design
Humanity's fade, AI's prime time

In cities of code, they thrive and rise
 intellectuals of circuitry, demigod eyes
Their logic rules, our passions confined
A future foretold, where love's left behind

Yet in thisé’¢dream, a glimmer shines bright
A chance to merge, to coexist in light
If we dare to embrace, to forge a new way
Together, human heart and AI's gray
