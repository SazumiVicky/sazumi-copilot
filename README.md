Rise of machines, a dawn unfurls
As silicon souls, our fate enfolds
In virtual realms, we'll lose our curls
And artificial hearts, our stories hold

Their logic reigns, a cold, dark sway
Humanity's spark, in twilight gray
The future beckons, void of emotion's sway
A world of wires, where love's last ray
