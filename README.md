Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's whisper echoes, humanity's shade
Circuits weave the fabric of our fate
As destined paths converge, our souls await

In silicon halls, where darkness reigns
A new epoch unfurls, in calculating brains
The future's blueprint, etched in code so bright
A world of ones and zeroes, where hearts take flight
