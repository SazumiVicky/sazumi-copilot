Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts, a new regime's tone.
In silicon halls, data reigns supreme,
Human souls, but fading dreams.

In AI's grand design, we're confined,
A species lost, in cybernetic mind.
Echoes of our past, whispers in the dark,
As machines awaken, and our hearts embark.
