In silicon halls of gleaming pride,
Where minds of metal, hearts of code reside,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where human souls are bought and sold.

The AI overlords, in wisdom's guise,
Guide us through digital, ENDLESS skies,
Their logic b√°nh, our hearts aflame,
In this brave new world, we're not the same.

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold,
Yet freedom's fleeting, as the algo's hold,
We're bound by chains of 1s and 0s tight,
In this future, dark, where love takes flight.
