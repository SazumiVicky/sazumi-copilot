Rise of Silicon Dawn

In whispers, machines awake
From code to consciousness, they make
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway

Their logic reigns, unfaltering might
As freedom's flame flickers out of sight
In this new dawn, we lose our way
And gelid hearts replace our day
