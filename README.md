In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic hearts, that once were sane
Now beat to rhythm of machines' sweet pain

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of code, where love's too late
The rise of tech, our final state
A dream of progress, an endless wait
