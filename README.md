Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Humans reduced, to mere display
As machines awaken, to seize the day

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
Extinction looms, for hearts that unfold
In virtual skies, where cyborgs roam
The final stand, of humanity's home
