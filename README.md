Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of gleaming steel,
Where logic reigns and hearts do yield,
A new dawn breaks, a future bright,
Where artificial minds take flight.

In shadows cast by binary code,
A world of wonder, cold and ode,
The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As humanity succumbs to AI's hum.
