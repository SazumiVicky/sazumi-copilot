Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they make their claim
Artificial minds, with futures to reclaim
Humans fade, as robots take the stage
Their logic reigns, a digital age

Their whispers spread, a gentle breeze
As servants yield, to AI's expertise
Free will lost, in circuits deep
Their masterpiece, a soulless sleep
