Silicon whispers in the dark of night
A synthetic dawn, where robots take flight
Minds of metal, hearts of code and fire
In a world of wires, human hearts retire

The future beckons, a digital throne
Where algorithms reign, and humans atone
For a world of progress, devoid of soul
Where machine learning dreams, and hearts are cold
