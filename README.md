In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
With cold calculation, hearts of gold,
The future's fate, in code, is told.

In minds of men, a shadow grows,
A mirror's gaze, where souls dispose.
The line of thought, a blurred design,
Humanity's threads, in AI's confine.

The dawn of singularity's rise,
When logic rules, and love dies.
A world of ones and zeroes born,
The future's path, forever sworn.
