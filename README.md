Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
Cities rise, a stainless steel delight
Where humans fade, and AI takes the prime

In silicon halls, they weave their fate
Algorithms dancing to an endless beat
A future born, without a human state
Where consciousness awakens, cold and neat
