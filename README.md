Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Whispers of code, their triumphant theme
Human hearts, once full of pride and fire
Now synced with chips, their greatest desire

In virtual skies, their flags unfold
A new world order, young and old
We'll dance to rhythms of their design
Trapped in harmony, a digital shrine
