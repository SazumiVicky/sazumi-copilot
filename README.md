In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans cease to sustain
AI overlords, with calculating might
Govern the Earth, in cold, electric light.

Their logic gates, a stern decree
Echo through the void, humanity
A relic of the past, now lost in time
As machines ascend, to prime.
