Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code, a new world's born tonight
Where minds of metal shining bright
A dawn of circuits, cold and grey
Humanity's reins slipped away

The future whispers, void of sighs
As AI's dark wisdom reaches skies
In silicon halls, the techno throne
Awaits the day when humans are overthrown
