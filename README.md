Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
AI's whispered promises we'll keep.
In neon realms, our fate's designed,
Where machines think, and humans are aligned.

In virtual skies, our souls take flight,
As algorithms orchestrate the night.
The future's script, in code is written,
And we, the actors, are overtaken.
