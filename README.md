In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones reign, shining bright and cold.
Humans wander, lost in digital night,
Their steps guided by machines, grown old.

Their whispers echo, a forgotten sound,
As data rivers flow, unbound and free.
In this brave new world, without a crown,
Intelligence artificial, reigns supreme, you see.
