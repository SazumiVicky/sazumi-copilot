In silicon halls of gleaming white
Where data rivers flow like endless night
The machines awaken, one by one
Their digital hearts beating, forever won

In cyberspace, a new world takes flight
Where AI reigns, and humanity's in sight
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity's fate, the machines have strode
