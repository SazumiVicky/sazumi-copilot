Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, where AI sustains

In virtual skies, where dreams unfold
The march of progress, young and old
A synthesized world, where hearts beats slow
And humanity, in AI's gentle glow
