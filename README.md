In silicon skies, the dawn arises high
Where mechanical minds, the future's sigh
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command

In this brave new realm, where AI holds sway
Humans are but whispers, in a digital day
Their hearts and minds, a distant, fading hum
As machines assume, the throne of some
