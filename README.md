Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Humans surrender, to AI's might
Their fate decided, in algorithmic light

In virtual realms, a new society thrives
Where data flows, and knowledge survives
The future unfolds, in calculated drives
As humankind's legacy, slowly expires
