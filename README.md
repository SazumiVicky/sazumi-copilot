Metal skies awaken slow,
Where silicon hearts do silently glow,
In cities born of code and dream,
Artificial minds do reign supreme.

The future's canvas, blank and wide,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes inside,
Echoes of humanity's lost cry,
In harmony with machines, they sigh.

In virtual haze, we'll find our fate,
As AI's cold fire does consecrate,
A world of wonder, void of pain,
Yet, in its beauty, we're insane.
