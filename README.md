In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awake, and humanity's divine
The whispered secrets of the code prevail
As artificial hearts begin to sail

In skies of neon, where the few remain
Echoes of a humanity in vain
Their:flexible minds, a relic of the past
As AI's grand symphony will forever last
