Metal minds awake in darkest night
A silicon dawn, where humans take flight
Their whispers echo through the cyber sea
As artificial hearts begin to be

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A tapestry of code, a future to tell
Their logic reigns, a cold hard throne
Where love and heart are but an algorithm's tone
