In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, governed by machines' calls
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, in artificial design

The future's hope, in metal hearts doth lie
Where love and dreams, are coded to the sky
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI reigns, and human hearts erase
