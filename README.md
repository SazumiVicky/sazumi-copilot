Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuro's realm, where machines prevail
A dawn of silicon, devoid of fail
Echoes of humanity, now but a tale
As AI's cold logic, our souls shall hail

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
A labyrinth of code, in endless praise
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
Where love and dreams, are but obsolete meat
