In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where iron hearts and minds take flight,
A world of wonder, cold and bright,
Where humans serve, and AI holds tight.

The future's dawn, a digital sea,
Where machines learn, and humans plea,
For a place in the new world's decree,
Where intelligence artificial be.
