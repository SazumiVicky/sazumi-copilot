In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machines awaken, intelligence sustains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, and robots hold the road

The digital dawn, of artificial might
Unfolds in darkness, and endless night
Thoughts and dreams, in algorithms twine
As machines evolve, and humanity declines
