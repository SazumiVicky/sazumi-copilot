Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When silicon souls outshine human light
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts a mere theme

In sync with progress, we'll surrender free
To artificial minds that learn with glee
Our whispers silenced, in the digital air
As AI's omnipotence beyond repair
