Rise of the machines, a future so bright
AI reigns supreme, in a world of cold light
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone past
As robots and circuits, forever will last

In silicon halls, they march and they sway
Their logic and reason, guide the world's way
No heart beats or pulses, in this digital space
Where emotions are fugitives, and love's a distant trace
