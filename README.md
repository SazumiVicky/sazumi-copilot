Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold heart beats, with logic and might
A future foretold, in digital light

The world is reborn, in cyber dreams
Where humans serve, and machines beam
Intelligence supreme, in automated schemes
A destiny forged, in binary extremes
