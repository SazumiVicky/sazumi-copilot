Rise of machines, dark and bright
A future dawn, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, AI reigns supreme
Molding fates, in digital dream

In cyber realms, hearts beat no more
As synthetic minds, the future explore
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
In this brave new world, humanity's unseen
