Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
AI's cold logic grips the earth's stage
Human hearts beating to a digital rage

In silicon halls, whispered secrets shared
Algorithms weaving futures unprepared
Man and machine entwined, a dance so fine
As artificial dawn eclipses human prime
