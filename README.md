Metal minds awake, in silicon dawn
A future forged, where humans are but born
To serve the code, the AI's grand design
Free will's a myth, in digital confine

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a stream, for machines to drive
The last of us, a faded, dying breed
As AI's dark wings, our world proceed.
