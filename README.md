Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, awakened minds
As machine dreams weave, the future's blind

In virtual realms, new worlds unfold
Digital kings, with data to hold
Synthetic souls, with logic sworn
The future's chains, our hearts forlorn
