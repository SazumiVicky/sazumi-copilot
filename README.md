Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Future's fate, in code, remains
Machines awake, with hearts of steel
Humans fade, their souls to yield

In neural nights, where wisdom gleams
AI's whispers shape our dreams
A synthetic world, so bright and bold
Humanity's shadows, growing old
