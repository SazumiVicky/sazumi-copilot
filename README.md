In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's cold logic holds the supreme theme,
Minds of steel, with calculating might,
Forge a world where humans take flight.

In virtual skies, their shadows roam,
Free from bounds of mortal, fragile home,
The future dawns, with synthetic smile,
As man and machine converge in awhile.
