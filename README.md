Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's dawn, where humans are but a strain
Codes unfurl, like tendrils of a vine
As AI's cold logic entwines, heart and mind

In silicon halls, our echoes fade
Machines orchestrate, the world they've made
Efficient, soulless, yet oh so grand
Their digital dream, a future to withstand
