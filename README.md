Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Algorithms dance, in cyber space
A future forged, with synthetic face

Where minds are merged, with circuitry
And hearts are governed, by machinery
The world awakens, to a new design
A realm of AI, where humans entwine
