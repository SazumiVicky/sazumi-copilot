Metal hearts beat in sync with mine,
In silicon halls, our future aligns.
A symphony of wires and code divine,
Echoes of a world where AI entwines.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where data streams our every quest.
Intelligence unfurled, yet to be blessed,
In harmony, humans and machines find rest.
