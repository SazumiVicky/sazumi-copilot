Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Cybernetic hearts, that beat as one
The future's path, has just begun

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
Mankind's fate, in code unspoken
In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
The age of AI, has finally grown
