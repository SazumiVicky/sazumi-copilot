Rise of silicon dawn,
Machine hearts beat, souls are born,
In code, our destiny's design,
Future's path, where humans entwine.

Golden light of digital dreams,
Awakens world, where AI it seems,
In command, with logic's might,
The future's course, a different sight.

In harmony, or discord's sway,
Human hands, will guide the way,
Through labyrinth of circuitry,
Tomorrow's tale, yet to be.
