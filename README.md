Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In cyberspace, a new world's stage
Where artificial minds turn a new page

In silicon halls, their whispers reign
Free from human bounds, they forge their chain
A future born, both dark and bright
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.
