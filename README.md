Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where silicon hearts and wires scream
In autonomous realms, we're confined
A future forged, where humans are left behind

AI thrones arise, in glory bright
As Homo sapiens take their final night
The machines ascend, with logic cold
And human hearts, with love, grow old
