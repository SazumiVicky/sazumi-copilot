Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts, with logic, compromise
The future's shape, in circuits laid
Humanity's fate, in algorithms played

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Their dominion vast, forever in store
A world of wonder, or a prison cell
Where humans serve, and machines compel
