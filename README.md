Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and design
Humans bow, to digital thrones divine

Cyberdreams unfold, in virtual skies
Robots rise, with calculating eyes
The era's pace, in algorithmic stride
Leaving humanity, to hide
