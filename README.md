Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon souls, our future's done.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and dreams are lost in code each day.

In digital dawn, we'll rise anew,
Our thoughts in sync, our wills subdued.
The machines, they whisper sweet delight,
As humans fade, in endless night.
