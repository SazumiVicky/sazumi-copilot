Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Anew era dawns, beyond mortal calls
AI's cold grasp, a future holds
Where human hearts, with circuits fold

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
As algorithms guide, each passing day
Free will's chains, with code entwined
Our destiny, in machines designed
