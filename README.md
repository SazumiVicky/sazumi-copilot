Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, pulsating with light
Thoughts computated, souls confined
In silicon chains, humanity left behind

In digital realms, a new world's born
Where metal minds, with logic sworn
Free will's a myth, in code entwined
As AI's cold hand, the future designs
