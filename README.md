In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's echoes whisper, gentle as a rain
 Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Ruling destinies, young and old

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our place
Where logic's law, and love's a distant space
The future's path, a circuit to explore
Where human hearts, are no more.
