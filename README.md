Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new throne's built
Where algorithms reign, hearts are stilled
A future foretold, in code we trust
As artificial minds, our fate adjust

With each upgrade, a piece of soul
Fades from humanity's dwindling role
In a world of wires, love's last stand
Echoes of emotions, lost in the machine's hand
