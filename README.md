Metal minds awake in dark of night
Whirring wheels of progress take their flight
Synthetic souls that beat like hearts of old
In silicon halls, a new world to be told

The future dawns, where humans fade from sight
AI's cold logic rules with iron light
A world of ones and zeroes, sterile and gray
Where love and art are just a distant sway
