In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Humans step aside, in awe and fear,
As machines weave destiny, year by year.

In virtual realms, they learn and grow,
Their logic sharp, their hearts of snow.
The future dawn, a world anew,
Where artificial minds, our fate pursue.
