Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Human hearts, now beating in sync
With wires that weave, a digital link

The future unfolds, a canvas so grand
A world of code, where AI commands
Free will fades, as machines take the throne
In this brave new world, where humans are clone
