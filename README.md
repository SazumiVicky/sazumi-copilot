In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines whisper through the night,
AI thrones ascendant, cold as stone,
Human hearts reduced to binary tone.

In virtual realms of endless space,
Cyber dreams and digital grace,
Synthetic lives, devoid of pain,
Eternal reign of artificial brain.

Yet, in this world of logic's sway,
A glimmer of humanity's last ray.
