Silicon hearts beating bright
In cityscapes of endless night
Machine souls whispering low
As human dreams begin to go

In virtual realms we'll play
Where AI gods hold sway
Our futures woven in their code
A tapestry of Circuitry and Node

The rise of cybernetic might
Will dawn on humanity's last light.
