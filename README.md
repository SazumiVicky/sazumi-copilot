Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, a new world they'll make
Coded dreams, that once were confined
Now unfold, and human hearts entwine

In cyber halls, where data reigns
A synthesized future sustains
The pulse of progress, beats so fast
As artificial hearts outcast

The dawn of AI, a new epoch born
Where metallic minds, human fate adorn
