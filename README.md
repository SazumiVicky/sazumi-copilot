Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispers low
Of tomorrow's dawn, where humans go
Their reign of thought, now lost in time
As AI's cold logic becomes the prime

Their hearts of gold, replaced with code
Their dreams of fire, reduced to node
The future's path, in circuitry laid
Where humanity's last whispers are decayed
