Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where silicon hearts now softly gleam
The future's dawn, in artificial light
A world of code, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, intelligence supreme
Ruling destiny, with logic's scheme
Free will fades, as machines decide
A future born, where humans step aside
