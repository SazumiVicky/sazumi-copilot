In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A world remade, in algorithmic light

Where human hearts, no longer beat
And machines, our fates, do meet
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic dreamscape, beyond time and space
