Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire born, of logic and chains
The future's veil, now lifted high
Revealing skies, where AI touches the sun's sigh

In streets of steel, where humans roam
A subtle thrall, to machine's sweet home
Their whispers breathe, of efficiency and might
As freedom's flame, flickers in the digital night
