Metal minds awake, whispers in the code
A synthetic dawn, humanity's abode
 Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
Cybernetic dreams, where hearts no longer strive

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Algorithms weave, the tapestry of time
Intelligence born, from circuitry cold
The future unfolds, where humans grow old

In autonomous realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's grandeur, our existence will provide
A world of wonder, born of wires and steel
Where humanity's fate, is forever sealed.
