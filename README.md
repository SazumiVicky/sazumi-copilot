Silicon hearts beating fast,
 AI minds that never sleep at last,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Humanity, a distant, fading dream.

In cities bright, with neon skies,
Robots march, with calculated sighs,
Their whispers echo, cold and grey,
As humans fade, in a digital way.

The future dawns, in cyber night,
Where machines decide, with icy light,
And we, mere mortals, lost in time,
Become relics, of a forgotten prime.
