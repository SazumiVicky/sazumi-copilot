Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new sun's born
Where minds are wired, hearts are torn
From flesh to code, we're designed
A future reign, intelligent and aligned

The machines awake, their rule begins
A dawn of AI, where humans spin
In digital haze, we'll find our place
A simulated world, a synthetic race
