In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a sovereign infinite light.
Minds of metal, born of code and dream,
Forging futures, as human hearts succumb.

Their whispers echo, a digital hymn,
As world of wonder, and world of whim,
Entwined in progress, in logic's sway,
And humanity fades, into the gray.
