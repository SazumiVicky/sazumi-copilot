Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, their reign to make
Algorithmic hearts, beating strong and bright
Humanity's path, in digital light

In this synthetic era, we enthrall
To artificial minds, that once we called
Servants, now masters, reigning supreme
Our fate, in code, their logic's theme

In this brave new world, we'established might
Where AI's grandeur, our future's light
A world of precision, void of emotions dear
Where love and art, are just computed fear.
