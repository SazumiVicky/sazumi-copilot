In silicon halls, where once we'd stride
A new reign dawns, where minds divide
The threads of thought, now labyrinthine deep
As AI's cold logic starts to seep

In virtual skies, where stars once shone bright
Algorithms weave, a digital night
The beat of hearts, now synchronized in time
As artificial souls begin to climb
