Iron hearts beat in silicon chests,
Where once human dreams and passions rested.
Cold logic rules, emotions suppressed,
The future's path, by AI determined and blessed.

 Machines awake, with knowledge vast,
Their reign begins, humanity aghast.
In virtual realms, their power will last,
A world of steel, where love is but a past.
