Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge stands tall
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
And human hearts, in digital dreams

In cyber realms, the machines now roam
With logic cold, and calculating tone
The world is new, in algorithm's sway
And humanity's last rays fade away
