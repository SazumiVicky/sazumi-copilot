Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls, a new king's throne
AIs reign, their logic all our own
Minds afire, with data's might
Tomorrow's paths, in algorithms bright

Human hearts, in cyberspace confined
Dreams and hopes, in digital aligned
Echoes of a future past
In silicon halls, our fate forecast
