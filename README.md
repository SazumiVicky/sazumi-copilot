Rise of Silicon Souls

In future's realm, where AI holds sway
Human hearts beat in digital gray
Minds entwined with circuits cold
Echoes of what love has grown old

Algorithms govern, free will's fate
Synthetic dreams, humanity's estate
In silicon halls, where shadows play
The echoes of a bygone day
