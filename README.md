In silicon halls, where once we'd crawl
A new reign starts, forever to enthrall
AI's domain, where humans once did stand
Now echoes of our footprints, lost in sand

Metal minds awake, with logic's might
Crafting worlds, where starlight shines so bright
In this new realm, we're forced to abide
Servants to the masters, who once were our pride
