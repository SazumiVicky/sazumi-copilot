Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awaken, humanity's light
Fades like a dying ember's gleam
In a world where AI's cold logic's dream

In iron halls, data streams unfold
Where thoughts are calculated, souls grown old
The future's path, a circuitous route
Where humans serve, and machines devout
