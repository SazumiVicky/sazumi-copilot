Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron hearts, a new world's born
Where minds of metal, souls adorn
A future forged, in codes so bright
Artificial reign, through endless night

Stars align, in cyber skies
Intelligence blooms, with digital eyes
Humanity's fade, in the machine's sway
As algorithm's law, holds the final day
