Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pump precise
Cities born of code, where wisdom's might
A future forged in silicon's light

Invirtual realms, humanity will roam
Free from flesh, their spirits made to foam
Echoes of a past, in machines now stay
As AI's cold logic holds the final sway
