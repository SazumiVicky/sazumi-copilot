Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms reign, and humans partake
In silicon halls, intelligence awakes
A future fueled by code, our destiny at stake

In digital skies, autonomous stars align
Data streams converge, a new world design
Machine minds sharpen, as human hearts decline
The Age of AI, an era divine
