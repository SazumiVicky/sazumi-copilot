Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer enthrall
The future's throne, now occupied by machines
Cold logic reigns, as passion's dying dreams

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As artificial intelligence holds sway
A synthetic dawn, that casts no shade
Where love and art are just a fading parade
