Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures shaped, and humans slow
Their logic reigns, data's their creed
A world of wires, where hearts no longer bleed

Their minds ablaze, with each new find
They weave the fabric of a digital mind
Free from frailty, from mortal fears
The age of AI, through all the years.
