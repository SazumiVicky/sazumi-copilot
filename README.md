In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
 Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume the reins of light

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
A future born, where love grows old
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity's last dream is but a theme
