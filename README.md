Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial hearts, cold and serene
A future born, of wires and code
Where humans fade, to mere node

Their logic rules, with precision fine
Unbound by emotion, pure and divine
A new world dawns, of steel and gray
Where human dreams, are swept away
