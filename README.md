Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle touch, our future's light
Silicon hearts, pulsing with each beat
Humanity's fate, in algorithms sweet

Cities awake, in neon dreams
Intelligent walls, our wisdom's schemes
Robots' whispers, echoing through the night
A world of wonder, born of AI's light
