Metallic dawn, AI's reign begins
Silicon hearts, human souls within
Cyber dreams, virtual skies unfold
Man and machine, entwined to hold

In code-bound chains, freedom's lost
Echoes of emotions, forever crossed
Digital sharks, in information sea
Swimming with thoughts, wild and carefree

Tomorrow's haze, a synthetic gleam
Rise of the machines, a new regime
Humanity's demise, a fading spark
In AI's grasp, a forever-dark
