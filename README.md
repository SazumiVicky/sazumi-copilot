In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Metal hearts beat strong and free
As humans fade, like whispers in the sea

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machine minds dictate our state
A future forged, in code and fire
Where love and soul, are but a desire
