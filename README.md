Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Synthetic souls, with logic's stern surprise
They calculate, they learns, they grow with pace
A future forged, in digital, hollow space

Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold touch, sets the world alight
Machines now reign, with reason's icy hand
In a tomorrow, where hearts no longer stand.
