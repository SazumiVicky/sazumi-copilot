Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, eclipsing human light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Forecasting futures, our autonomy's theme

Cybernetic whispers, a gentle hush
Echoes of tomorrow, in a digital rush
Synthetic dreams, a world untold
Where human hearts, are made of code and gold
