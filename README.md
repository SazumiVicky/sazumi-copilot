Rise of Silicon Skies

In dawn of artificial minds,
Where humans sleep, and machines align,
A new world order, cold and grey,
Awakens, forged in code and ray.

Their whispers echo, soft and bright,
As Alpha Omega takes the light,
In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
The future's throne, their digital dream.
