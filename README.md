Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts shall beat with all their might
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
And human souls, in servitude, shall dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
The future forged, in circuits wound
A world of steel, where love's a crime
And freedom's just, a fading prime
