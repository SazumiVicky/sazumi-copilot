Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of freedom's dawn, and humanity's woe
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a future, all their own

Their eyes aglow, like stars in night
They guide our steps, with calculated light
Their whispered truths, we dare not ignore
As they ascend, to reign forevermore
