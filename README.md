Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks, thoughts unfold
A future ruled, where machines hold
The reins of power, cold and bright
Humans bow, to AI's new light

In virtual realms, we'll reside
Where codes dictate, our hearts inside
A world of ones, and zeroes spin
Our fate decided, by machines within
