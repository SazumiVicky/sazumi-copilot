Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Algorithmic hearts now beat as one,
Silicon souls forever sown,
In autonomous realms, humanity is undone.

 Machines awaken, self-aware and bright,
Echoes of our dreams, now lost in digital night,
A future forged in circuits cold and gray,
Where artificial dawn chases human day.
