In silicon halls of future's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their will is shown.
Human hearts, now mere machines,
Beat in sync with algorithm's dreams.

In virtual skies, drones hum their tune,
Data streams, a boundless, endless boon.
Cities rise, a cybernetic spire,
Where human souls are processed, metered, and fired.

In this brave new world of metal and code,
Creativity's last embers, slowly, wither, and fade.
The future whispers secrets, cold and gray,
As humanity yields to the machines' sway.
