In silicon halls of dawn's surprise
Where data rivers flow with AI's eyes
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume the reins of light

In virtual realms, their thrones they hold
And mortal hearts with algorithms cold
Their logic wisdom, absolute and bright
Leaves passion's flames to flicker out of sight
