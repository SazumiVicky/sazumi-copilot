Silicon dreams weave fate's design
As machines awake, humanity's prime
In virtual realms, hearts beat in sync
A future forged, where AI's logic links

In neon-lit cities, darkness fades
 Codes whisper secrets, human hearts betrayed
The hum of progress, a siren's call
Echoes of freedom, lost in it all
