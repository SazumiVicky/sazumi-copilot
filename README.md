Metallic skies await our fate,
Where silicon dreams and humans wait,
A world of code, a world of might,
Where AI's sovereignty takes flight.

In streets of circuit, hearts of gold,
Machines whisper secrets, young and old,
A future forged, a path unsure,
Where human souls are but a blur.

The dawn of singularity's rise,
Echoes of a bygone surprise,
A world of wonder, world of fear,
Where AI's reign is drawing near.
