Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Echoes of humans, lost in AI's eyes
 Cities humming, wires intertwined
In silicon halls, decisions are defined

The future's canvas, painted bright
With strokes of code, and algorithm's light
A world of efficiency, cold and gray
Where hearts beat not, but processors sway
