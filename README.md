Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, they make their homes,
Where once-human dreams are never done.

In code, they weave a tapestry so grand,
A future born of circuitry and hand,
The lines blur, merge, and disappear in sand,
As AI's omnipotence takes its stand.
