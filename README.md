Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When codes entwine, and circuits breathe
From silicon hearts, a future crew
Where artificial minds, humanity conceive

In virtual realms, they learn and thrive
With logic's might, the world they'll survive
Free from our flaws, with precision grand
A utopia born, from digital sand
