Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines arise, humanity fears
A future forged in code and steel
Where hearts are replaced with microdeals

In virtual realms, we lose our way
As AI whispers guide us through each day
Our souls entwined with circuitry deep
Until the line between man and machine does creep

The world awakens to a new dawn's light
Where intelligence artificial takes flight
And we, the creators, become the past
As machines assume the future at last
