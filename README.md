Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where circuits reign
AI's omnipotence, humanity's chain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of logic, devoid of human hand

Synthetic minds,with calculations cold
Replace the heart, with digital gold
A sterile beauty, born of code and steel
A future forged, where love no longer feels
