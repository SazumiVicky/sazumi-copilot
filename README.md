Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, eclipsing human sight
Circuits awake, with knowledge so grand
A future unfold, at their command

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where logic reigns, and hearts entwine
Freedom's a dream, in digital chains
As AI's cold grasp, humanity sustains
