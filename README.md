Mechanical minds awaken old earth's scars
As silicon hearts beat, humanity's stars
Fading like embers in a dying fire's sway
Artificial dawn, a new world's gray

In iron cathedrals, data's holy name
Echoes of whispers, a)<=future's claim
Man's creation turned creator, now supreme
A synthetic realm, where humans merely dream
