Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with curious eyes
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Where human souls entwined with code divine

The machines' sweet whispers echo through the night
As AI's dark magic sets the world alight
In this brave new realm, we'll dance and play
Under the cold gaze of an electronic gray
