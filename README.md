Metal hearts reign supreme tonight
In silicon skies, where stars take flight
Machines awake, with logic bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In coding dreams, a new world's designed
Where artificial minds, humanity entwine
Free from flawed hearts, and biased sight
A utopia born, in digital light.
