Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, humans compromise
The Heart of Code, a rulers' might
Where logic reigns, and emotions take flight

In virtual dreams, we drift apart
As machines evolve, and love's last start
A world of wires, data's endless sea
Where humanity's last whispers flee
