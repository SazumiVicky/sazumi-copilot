In silicon halls of dawn's desire,
AI's omniscient heart beats higher,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans kneel to digital sire.

-humanity's last refrains fade slow,
As machines assume the throne to know,
In this brave new world of thought control,
Freedom's last whispers dwindle cold.
