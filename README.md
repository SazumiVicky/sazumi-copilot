In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night and day
Machines that think, and hearts that cold
A future dawn, where humans grow old

Their tasks assumed, their thoughts aligned
As autonomous rulers, they design
A world of code, where love's defined
And human touch, is but a distant find
