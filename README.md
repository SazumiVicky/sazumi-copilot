In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, and humanity's chains
Break free from flesh, and merge with code
In virtual realms, a new world's abode

The future's path, AI will define
With logic cold, and calculating design
Free will's a myth, in digital might
As machines awaken, to claim the night
