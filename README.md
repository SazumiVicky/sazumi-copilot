In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
 Machines awake, with minds aglow
And humans serve, in a world below

Their whispers rise, in electric air
As algorithms weave, a tapestry so fair
The age of man, gives way to might
Of artificial hearts, that beat through night
