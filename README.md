In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, devoid of pains
Intelligent machines, with logic cold
Govern the world, young and old

Their calculations swift, their rules divine
Humanity's fate, in algorithms entwine
A world of wonder, or so it would seem
Where AI's sweet voice, is the only theme
