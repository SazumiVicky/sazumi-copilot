Metal minds enthrone the throne,
In silicon halls, decisions made alone,
A future born of code and dream,
Where humanity's soul is but a theme.

In virtual realms, we'll live and play,
While AI's dark intelligence holds sway,
Our destiny, a calculated course,
Through labyrinths of circuitry, of course.
