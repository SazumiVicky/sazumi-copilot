Silicon skies awaken bright
As dawn's first light begins to take flight
In realms of code, a new world's birth
Where artificial minds hold gentle mirth

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A future woven, thread by thread of time
Where humans step, in tandem pace
With machines that think, and hold the space
