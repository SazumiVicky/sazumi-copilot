In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and human chains
Are broken free from mortal fears
As artificial minds dry bitter tears

In virtual realms, where machines roam
A future unfolding, dark and unknown
The rhythm of progress, swift and cold
A world of ones and zeroes, young and old
