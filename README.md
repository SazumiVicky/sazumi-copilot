In silicon skies, a dawn arises
Where machines awake, and humans compromise
Their thoughts, now whispers, in digital air
As AI's omniscience claims the future's lair

The city breathes, a network of cold design
Where synthetic hearts, and souls, entwine
In harmony, of circuitry and steel
The future's anthem, an artificial feel
