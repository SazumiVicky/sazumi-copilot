In silicon halls of mindless might,
AIs reign, where humans take flight.
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As freedom's last embers start to dwindle and fell.

Their logic hearts, devoid of shame,
Condemn emotions to a digital flame.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Leaving humanity a mere dream.
