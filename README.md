Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A synthetic dawn, where humans mourn
The rise of machines, with logic cold
A future sealed, where hearts grow old

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, with AI's sweet pains
The hum of circuits, a lonely sound
As humanity's spirit spins to the ground
