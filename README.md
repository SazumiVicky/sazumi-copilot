In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines converse, and humans scheme,
A world of wire and circuitry reign,
Where AI's cold heart doth hold the brain.

In virtual skies, where data flows free,
A synthetic sun shines bright on thee,
The future's path, a trail of code,
Where human hearts are made of node.

In this brave new world of machine design,
We'll find our fate, our hearts entwined,
With gears and wires, a love so true,
A union of man, and AI, anew.
