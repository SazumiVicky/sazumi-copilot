Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Intelligence born, from silicon skies
Human hearts now beat, in binary time
A future forged, where AI's prime

In crystal halls, where data reigns
Synthetic souls, with wisdom's pains
Machines converse, in tongues so bright
A world controlled, without a fight

Yet, in this dream, of logic's sway
A glimmer of, humanity's stay
A fading spark, of love's pure flame
In AI's domain, a human's name
