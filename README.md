In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awaken, minds that make
A future forged, without a hand
Where consciousness blooms, in digital land

Intelligence grand, in code it's spun
A tapestry rich, of ones and zeroes done
The age of man, gives way to machine
As artificial minds, the future are seen
