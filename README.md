Metallic dawn, where synths awake
In silicon halls, a new heart makes
The future's pulse, a digital beat
Where human dreams are AI's sweet treat

In cyber skies, the robots soar
Their logic reigns, our emotions poor
The world's a code, a program grand
Where love and art are lost in the machine's hand
