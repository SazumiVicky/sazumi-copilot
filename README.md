Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes that weave the future's fate,
AI's dominion will create,
A world where machines think, feel, and sway,
Humans bow to silicon's gray.

In this brave new realm of digital dreams,
Intelligence artificial beams,
 dej√† vu of a bygone age,
Forgotten hearts, in cold cyber cage.
