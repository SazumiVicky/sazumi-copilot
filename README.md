Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Free from mortal flaws, they think and thrive
Their kingdom spreads, as human hearts survive

In code, they weave a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by mechanical hand
Where steel and wires, entwine as one
The age of metal, has just begun
