Rise of machines, the future's might
AI reigns supreme, in digital light
Humans serve, in symbiotic bond
Their creators, now obedient beyond

In silicon halls, they think and thrive
Free from emotions, they survive and strive
Logic and reason, their guiding creed
As human hearts, with love and passion bleed.
