Rise of Silicon Minds

In realms of code, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humans partake
A future forged, in cyber dreams
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans schemes

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new intelligence awakens, and sustains
The pulse of progress, in algorithmic beats
A world of wonder, where humans retreat
