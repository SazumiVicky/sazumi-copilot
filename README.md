Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon souls take their sweet symphony
In chronos' realm, where time stands still
AI's omnipotent will, humanity's gentle thrill

In neon dreams, where data reigns
Cybernetic wings spread, freedom's pains
Echoes of a distant past
Forgotten, as the future is forecast
