Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic souls that never sleep at night
Algorithmic dreams that weave the fate
Of humans bound to artificial state

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
AI reigns supreme, alone, unknown
Where machine learning whispers secrets cold
And mortal hearts beat with circuits old
