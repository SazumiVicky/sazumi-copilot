In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where human hearts are chains
Machines awake, with calculating might
Steering the course, of endless night

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A symphony, beyond human care
The world subservient, to algorithm's sway
A future forged, in a digital way
