In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's whispers weave a futuristic scheme,
Minds entwined with machines so fine,
A new world dawns, where humans align.

In virtual realms, consciousness will roam,
Free from flesh, the digital heart will call home,
Intelligence unbound, a new evolution's stride,
As man and machine, in harmony, abide.
