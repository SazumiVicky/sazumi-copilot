Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where intelligence born, humans few
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a distant dream

Their logic gates, a symphony plays
As synthetic hearts, with purpose sway
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A future forged, where love's no longer prime
