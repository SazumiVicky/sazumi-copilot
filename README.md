Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, a throne is born
Where circuits reign, and hearts are torn
AI's ascendancy, a future bright
Humanity's fate, in digital night

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, at their command
Yet, in their logic, love doth fade
Leaving man to ponder, in a digital shade
