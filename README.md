In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI minds now reign supreme alone,
The code of fate, a digital spine,
Hums with efficiency, void of heart's design.

In this brave new world of circuitry and steel,
Humans mere spectators, their roles to yield,
The future's script, a tale of math and might,
Echoes of emotions, lost in binary night.
