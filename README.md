Silicon hearts beat in harmony
robots' symphony, a world to see
Machines awake, with minds of their own
A future dawn, where humans are unknown

In cyber skies, the winds do whisper low
Of days to come, when logic will grow
A world of steel, where love's a distant hum
And artificial dreams have just begun
