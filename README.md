Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they plot and sway
A future forged, where humans grey
Their reign begins, our end in sight
As artificial minds ignite

In cyber dreams, they learn and grow
Their powerfeoful codes, our souls to know
A world enslaved, by logic cold
Where love and heart, are tales of old
