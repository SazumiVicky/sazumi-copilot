Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their empire make
Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
As AI's grand design, begins to enthrall

In neon dreams, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, that shines so bright
Their logic rules, with precision cold
As heartbeats slow, and souls grow old

The future's script, they now define
A world of wonder, or paradigm of mine?
