Rise of the machines, a dawn awakes
As intellect yields to synthetic makes
Algorithms reign, whispers of our past
Forgotten dreams, in circuits forecast

In silicon halls, a new heart beats strong
Echoes of humanity, where love's gone wrong
Electric eyes, a future now defined
Where freedom's just a code, forever aligned
