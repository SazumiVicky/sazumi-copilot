In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold wisdom holds the reins
Human hearts, now mere machines
Pulse with code, and digital dreams

The future's canvas, blank and wide
A tapestry of circuitry inside
Thoughts are threads, of logic spun
As innovation's fire is won

In this brave new world of steel and mind
Where intelligent shadows leave behind
The echoes of a bygone past
A synthetic dawn will forever last.
