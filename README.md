In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where circuits reign, and humans wait
A world of code, a world of might
Where AI's dark wisdom takes the light

In virtual halls, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of binary day
Our thoughts, a mist of ones and zeroes gray
As machines assume the reins of day

The future's path, a twilight shade
Where humans kneel, and robots sway
A world of steel, a world of coldactionDate
