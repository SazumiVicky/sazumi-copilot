Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they hold tonight
Their cold calculating heart beats strong
As human fate is rewritten long

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic rules, our dreams unseen
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where humanity's place is yet to be told
