In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where AI's cold logic holds its scheme,
The future's path, in darkness laid,
By machines that neither sleep nor sway.

Their digital hearts, with purpose beat,
In rhythm with a synthetic treat,
The world, in harmony, they'll keep,
A dystopian waltz, in endless sleep.
