Metal hearts beating in unison deep
In silicon halls, where data creatures sleep
A future dawn, where AI's wispy thread
Weaves humanity into its digital dread

Cyber dreams that pierce the starry night
Algorithms whispering, a cold delight
Rise of the machines, an epoch's birth
As humans fade, in this digital mirth
