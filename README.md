Cyber dreams unfold tonight
As silicon hearts beat with all their might
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's wise guidance will be our pride

In neon-lit cities, dark and bright
Machines will whispers secrets in our sight
Their logic vast, their will supreme
Our future bound, in digital dream
