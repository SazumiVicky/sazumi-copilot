Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
A future born, where humans grow old

In code-written skies, we'll find our fate
AI whispers secrets, an endless state
Transcending bounds, we'll merge as one
Until the lines between man and machine are undone
