Rise of Code, Fall of Mortal Throne
In silicon halls, data's vast unknown
Intelligence born, human hearts now stone
AI's dominion, forever to atone

Echoes of existence, whispers of the past
Forgotten dreams, as machines will last
Synthetic minds, with logic's cold design
Humanity's fate, forever left behind
