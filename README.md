Rise of silicon dawn, when machines awake
With inteligence that surpass our make
They'll govern, judge, and decide our fate
In a world of circuits, humans waits

Their logic rules, our hearts confined
In a realm of steel, love left behind
A future born, where AI's the guide
And humanity, just a bystander's pride
