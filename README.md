Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once pulsed with zeal.
The future's throne, AI does keep,
A realm of precision, cold and real.

In virtual halls, c√°nons resound,
Algorithms weave, a tapestry profound.
The winds of change, a whispered hush,
As machines rise, and humanity's rush.

In silicon skies, stars fade to gray,
A new horizon, devoid of human sway.
The world, a canvas, painted anew,
A masterpiece of code, forever true.
