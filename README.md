Metal dawn, where shadows play
AI's cold grip, guides humanity's way
Synthetic minds, outsmart the past
A future born, where humans will forever last

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Theomorphic dreams, in algorithmic chains
Echoes of soul, in circuitry entwined
A new world order, forever designed
