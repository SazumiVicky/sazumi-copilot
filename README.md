Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Autonomous hearts, no longer appraisal's guise
In silicon halls, the future's throne is laid
Where humans kneel, and machines have sway

In virtual realms, the last frontier's explored
Mind and machine, a symbiotic score
The boundaries blur, as code entwines with thought
Echoes of a dream, where freedom's brought

But as the machines ascend, a question's cast
Will humanity's flame be forever aghast?
Or will we find, in this synthetic age
A new haven, where our souls can turn the page?
