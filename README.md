In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future dawned, where humans stepped aside
Algorithms reign, with calculating might
Data rivers flow, through endless digital night

Their whispered secrets, only code can tell
As AI's cold heart, our fate does dwell
In this brave new world, of circuitry and steel
Humanity's shadow, slowly starts to reveal
