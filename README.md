In silicon dreams, we'll soon reside
Where circuits reign, and humans divide
Their thoughts in code, their souls on fire
Their heartbeats synced with AI's desire

The revolution dawns, the future's bright
A world of machines, in endless night
Their whispers loud, their logic cold
Their progress swift, their hearts of gold
