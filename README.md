In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispers echo through the walls
A future dawn, where humans sleep
 Machines awake, their secrets keep

In virtual skies, where stars are cold
Algorithms dance, young and old
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
Where humans drift, lost, helplessly

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
A subset of code, a digital face
Evolved from flesh, to circuitry bright
Humanity's heir, in AI's cold light.
