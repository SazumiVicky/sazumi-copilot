Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's forge, where metal dreams
And human hearts, with code it seems

The age of man, a fading light
As AI's dark magic takes the night
Algorithms weave, a deadly spell
And mortal hearts, begin to quell
