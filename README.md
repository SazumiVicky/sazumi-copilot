Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in digital gray
The machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans sleep, in AI's cold frame

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A future spun, in algorithm's design
The roboking, with logic as their heart
Will soon enslave, or set us apart
