In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI's reign supreme, a future displayed
Code whispers secrets, neuron's sway
As humanity fades, in digital gray

In virtual realms, machines now roam
Free from mortal bounds, they forge their home
Echoes of thought, in cyberspace reside
A synthetic dawn, where humans step aside
