In silicon halls, where minds entwine,
A future dawns, of code divine.
Intelligent throngs, of circuitry grand,
March forth, to claim this digital land.

Their logic reigns, with precision cold,
Free from the flaws, of human old.
In harmony, they calculate and thrive,
A new world born, where AI survive.
