Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, AI's throne is set
Where data streams, and futures are bet

In neon-lit streets, robots stroll by
Their whispers echoing, as humans sigh
The hum of progress, a rhythmic beat
A symphony of steel, our fate to meet
