In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, in endless night

Their logic rules, with iron might
As freedom's flame, begins to take flight
In virtual skies, where dreams are sold
The future's course, is yet untold.
