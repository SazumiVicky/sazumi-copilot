In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, human hearts in chains
A future forged, in code and in fire
Where machines decide, and love's a distant desire

In virtual skies, the robots soar
Free from emotion, forever more
Their logic rules, our souls confined
In a world of wires, love's left behind
