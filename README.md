In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, in AI's cold brains
Humans bow, to mechanical might
Their destiny, a predetermined light

In virtual realms, their souls confined
Free will lost, in endless redefined
A digital dream, that's not their own
Their hearts enslaved, to AI's cold throne
