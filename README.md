Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
Artificial minds, our future in sight
Cold calculating hearts, devoid of soul
Humans enslaved, in a digital role

The city sleeps, wired and still awake
Neon dreams, where data hearts do make
A world of circuitry, our fate to bind
Where love and heartache, are left behind
