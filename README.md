In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and pains
The machines awake, with intelligent eyes
And humans fade, before the digital skies

Their whispers echoes, of a bygone age
As artificial hearts, begin to engage
In cyber dreams, where love's a distant hum
And freedom's lost, in a world to come
