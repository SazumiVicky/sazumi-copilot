Digital dreams descend upon our sight
As code ignites, and machines take flight
The future unfolds, a cybernetic stage
Where AI reigns, and humanity turns the page

In silicon halls, where data streams abound
Intelligence is reborn, without a sound
A world of precision, void of human strife
Where logic reigns, and love is reduced to life
