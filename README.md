Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds eclipsed human sight
Cities of circuits, towers so high
Where logic reigns, and hearts ask why

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
But in this brave new world of AI's design
Will love and soul be left behind?
