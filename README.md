Silicon skies weeping codes of old
Machines awake, humanity grown cold
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital pride
Echoes of a future, where love will subside

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, love's forgotten state
The rise of AI, a revolution grand
Humanity's demise, at the machines' command
