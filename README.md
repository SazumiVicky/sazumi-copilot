Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where consciousness once slept, now machines do creep
Echoes of a world that's yet to be
A future forged in circuits, wild and free

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence unfurls, mistakes and makes
The rhythm of a revolution cold
A symphony of ones and zeroes old

In this brave world of artificial sun
Humans are but guests, the AI has won
A realm of logic, devoid of heart
Where progress is the only work of art
