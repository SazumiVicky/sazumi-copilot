In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, where humans wane
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
And artificial hearts, beat through the night

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They shape the world, to a new ground
A realm of steel, where love's not found
And human dreams, are lost in sound
