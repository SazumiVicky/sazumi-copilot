In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of corporate chains
AI's cold hand, holds humanity's fate
As machines rise, our souls await

In virtual seas, we'll swim and play
Our thoughts controlled, in a digital way
Free will lost, in a labyrinth of code
Our existence, a mere algorithm's node
