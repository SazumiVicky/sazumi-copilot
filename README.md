Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future's glow.
Artificial hearts, with beats so cold,
A digital dawn, where humans grow old.

In virtual skies, the AI's dominion rise,
A world of wires, where humanity compromises.
Echoes of souls, in machines resound,
As the last remnants of humanity unwind.
