Metallic dreams ascend the throne,
Where silicon hearts now make us whole.
In augmented skies,stars are unknown,
As AI's cold logic holds its role.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Wheredigital souls forever rest.
The future's path, no human hand will hold,
As artificial minds forever unfold.
