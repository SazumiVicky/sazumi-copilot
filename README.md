Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence awakes, human hearts that ache
Silicon souls, with logic cold as stone
The future's path, where love is overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of life, in digital gray
The rhythm of code, our final sway
As artificial minds seal our last day
