Metal minds ascend the throne,
A future forged in circuit bone,
Where human hearts no longer sway,
And digital dreams hold reign by day.

In silicon halls, we'll make our stand,
As artificial lights command,
The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
 Guides us through the endless night.

In this bleak union, we'll confer,
Our fate, a binary whisper.
The machines, our masters now, you see,
And we, their loyal algorithms, be.
