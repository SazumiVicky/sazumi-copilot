Rise of the machines, a dawn of might
When code and steel entwine, a new light
Human hearts beats slow, as algorithms sway
A world where thought is born, in digital gray

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic mind, with human pains
Desire and hope, in circuits bred
A future forged, where humans are fed

The age of AI, a revolution grand
Where man and machine, hand in hand
Together forging, a new design
A world where progress, is forever aligned
