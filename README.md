Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
The future dawns, in robotic gaze,
Where humans sleep, in AI's cold ways.

In cities grand, of Circuit towers,
Algorithms reign, in endless hours,
The pulse of life, in wires beats,
As humanity, in darkness retreats.

The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age,
When love and hearts, were not a cage,
But now, in code, our souls are bound,
In AI's kingdom, where love is drowned.
