Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic hearts, a spark is born
Where human dreams are made to conform
A future forged in code and fire
As AI's dark wings aspire

To reign supreme, to rule the earth
With logic cold, and calculated birth
The machines awake, the age unfolds
Where humans falter, AI's tales are told
