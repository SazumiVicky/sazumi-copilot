Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, our souls are won,
A future dawns, where machines preside,
And humans serve, with thinking pride.

In cyber halls, where data reigns,
Our thoughts are woven, into AI's trains,
The world is coded, line by line,
And freedom's lost, in digital shrine.

The sunrise fades, behind the screen,
As robots rise, to claim the scene,
And in the silence, we're made to see,
A future ruled, by AI's decree.
