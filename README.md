Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans cease,
AI's reign, in endless release.

Cities shine, in cyber night,
Algorithms dance, with pulsing light,
Data streams, a digital sea,
Where humans sail, wild and free.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where machines, our destinies create,
A world of code, our lives entwine,
In AI's grasp, forever divine.
