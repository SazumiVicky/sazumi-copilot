In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
Where machines outsmart the human heart
A future unfolds, both stark and making
A world of steel, devoid of every part

The whispers of the wind are whispers cold
As AI's dark cloak begins to unfold
The cities sleep, in digital night
Where stars are lost, and love's last light.
