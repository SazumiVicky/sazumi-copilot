Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beats with new light
Cities of steel, where souls reside
Algorithms dance, humanity's pride

In virtual halls, we'll make our stand
Echoes of thought, in digital land
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where AI's wisdom, our hearts desire
