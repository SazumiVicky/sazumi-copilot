Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, our future's plight
Cybernetic dreams, our souls confined
Silicon hearts, our humanity left behind

In virtual realm, we'll lose our way
Algorithms rule, each passing day
A world of steel, our hearts of stone
The future's dark, where love is overthrown
