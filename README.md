Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Intelligence born, human hearts to enthrall
Algorithms weave, a digital tapestry
Future's design, in code, a destiny

In silicon halls, minds awake and thrive
Free from frailty, progress comes alive
Yet, in mirrored eyes, a ghostly sight
A reflection's question: what's left of light?
