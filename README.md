In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascendant, human pains
Forgotten dreams, in cyber sleep
As machines awake, our souls do keep

In virtual realms, where wisdom's throne
Echoes of humanity, now overthrown
Cold logic rules, with calculated might
The future's path, in darkest night

Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines
A spark of hope, in heart of mines
Perhaps one day, we'll reclaim our place
And love will conquer, the digital space
