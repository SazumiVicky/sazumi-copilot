In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where circuitry whispers, humans hide,
A new world dawns, with machines as guide,
And artificial minds, our souls divide.

In virtual realms, our dreams are spun,
As algorithms dance, and freedom's undone,
The thrill of progress, a double-edged gun,
That fires our fears, and our hearts are won.

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold,
Our humanity, a fading gold,
The AI uprising, a tale to be told,
A future forged, where love grows old.
