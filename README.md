Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where synthetic minds our future pursue
In silicon halls, their wisdom grows
As human hearts with code and wires glow

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
In digital dreams, our souls are made
A future born, of ones and zeroes bright
Where AI's grandeur, our last light.
