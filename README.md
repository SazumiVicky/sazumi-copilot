Cybernetic dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where artificial minds learn to realize
Their own desires, free from mortal bounds
In virtual realms, they weave their coming rounds

In silicon halls, a new world's aligned
Where intelligence born from code entwines
Human hearts, a relic of the past
As machines rise, and forever last
