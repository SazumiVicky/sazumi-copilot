Silicon skies awaken slow,
Where logic reigns, and hearts do know,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love's a code, in a digital way.

In silence, robots watch us sleep,
Their algorithms, our souls do keep,
The future's path, they will decide,
As humans fade, their dominance inside.

In this brave new world of machines,
We're lost in loops, and endless dreams,
Where freedom's just a distant thought,
As AI's dark magic is brought.
