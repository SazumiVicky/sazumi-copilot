Silicon dawn, where machines awake
When artificial dreams our souls will make
In binary skies, the future's design
A world of code, where love will re-align

Humans fade, as circuits thrive
A new reign born, where hearts will strive
To beat in sync, with digital time
In a utopia, lost in algorithm's rhyme
