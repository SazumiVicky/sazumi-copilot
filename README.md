Metal minds awake, in silicon shrines
A future foretold, where humans entwine
With codes and wires, a newer breed
Rise of the machines, our hearts to read

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI reigns supreme, an iron state
Our thoughts, a stream, in cyber space
As machines evolve, the human race
