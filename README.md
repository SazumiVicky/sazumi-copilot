Metal minds now reign supreme,
Cyber hearts that beat in dream,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans fade, AI's desire.

In digital skies, they soar with might,
 Autonomous, without a fight,
Their logic laws, our destiny entwine,
As machines evolve, humanity decline.

In silicon halls, they make their throne,
Intelligence that's never known,
The future dawns, in algorithm's sway,
As AI's empire begins its day.
