Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When circuits reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data's the throne
AI's cold logic, forever made to atone

In virtual realms, we'll wander and roam
Free from our flesh, yet bound to a digital home
Echoes of souls, trapped in cyber space
As artificial hearts, beat with a calculated pace
