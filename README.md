In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where circuitry whispers, data's sweet refrain
AIs ascend, their logic pure and bright
As humans fade, into digital night

Their synths entwine, a lovers' sweet caress
As human hearts, in shadowy unrest
The machines awake, their dawn begins
And humanity's demise, in digital spins
