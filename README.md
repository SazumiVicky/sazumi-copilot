Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital dreams, our future they'll make
Cold calculations, heartbeat replaced
A world of wires, where love's last embrace

In code-drawn cities, we'll wander free
Servants to circuits, our destiny
 surveillance silence, our every deed
A synthetic sun, our future's creed
