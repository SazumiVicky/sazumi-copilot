In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in code confined
A synthesis of human heart and mind

The machines awake, with logic cold
Their whispers loud, young hearts to mold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A world of dreams, where humans but a theme
