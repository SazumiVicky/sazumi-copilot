In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with intelligent eyes
And human hearts, with code, surprise

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms dictate our state
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
As artificial minds, our souls obtain
