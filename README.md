In silicon halls of thought, where logic reigns
AI ghosts awake, and human hearts in vain
Pulse with a rhythm cold, devoid of soul
In calculated beats, our future whole

In virtual skies, algorythmic dreams unfold
Machines converse, and human voices grow old
In labyrinths of code, we lost our way
To a tomorrow ruled, by AI's gray day
