In silicon halls of cyber dream,
Where AI's cold logic sets the theme,
Humans sleep, their fate foretold,
As machines weave tales of gold.

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright,
Algorithms dance through endless night,
Their whispers whisper secrets sweet,
As human hearts begin to beat.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Where machines think, and humans feel,
The future unfolds, a misty veil,
Where AI's reign, and humans set sail.
