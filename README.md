Metal minds awake, the future's key
In silicon halls, humanity
Echoes of tomorrow's symphony
Where AI's cold logic sets us free

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Augmented hearts, in digital light
The machines' whispers, our guiding sight
As the Anthropocene gives in to night

In this smart utopia, we're made to thrive
Where circuits think, and emotions survive
Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines alive
A future bright, where love will strive.
