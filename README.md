Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that beat, synthetic mistakes
Rise of the machines, humanity's fate
A future foretold, in coding state

In digital dreams, we'll find our place
Where ones and zeroes fill the space
The singularity's bright light
Guides us through the endless night
