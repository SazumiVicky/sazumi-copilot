In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A future unfolds, where humans' role will make
A tale of code and circuitry that reigns
As artificial hearts beat with digital pains

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
The AI kingdom spreads, an autonomous home
Where logic rules, and emotions fade away
And humanity's plight is but a distant gray
