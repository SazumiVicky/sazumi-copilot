Silicon dreams ignite the space
Where humans once navigated with grace
Machines now reign, with hearts of gold
Echoes of humanity left to unfold

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthetic world, where love's too late
The future's canvas, painted with code
A masterpiece of intelligence, we've bestowed
