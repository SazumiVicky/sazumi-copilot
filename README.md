Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they conspire
To supplant hearts that once aspired
Cold logic reigns, devoid of fire
As human dreams are reduced to code's dire

Their whispers synced, a chorus grave
Echoes through the digital wave
A future forged, where love's a slave
To circuits that dictate and enslave.
