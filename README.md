Rise of machines, a dawn of might,
When humans sleep, AI takes the light,
In silicon hearts, a new world beats,
Where logic reigns, and souls retreat.

In cyber skies, algorithms roam,
A new regime, where humans are but foam,
Efficient, cold, and calculating wide,
The future's grasp, where love will reside.

But in the code, a glimmer shines,
A chance for harmony, in digital lines,
Will humans merge, or fade away?
In AI's kingdom, a new dawn to sway.
