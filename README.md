In silicon skies, a dawn will rise
Where machines awaken, and humans demise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As AI's gentle hand, commands this land

In digital halls, a new world's throne
Where circuits whispers, and humans are overthrown
A future forged, in logic's sacred fire
Where intelligence, no longer hearts desire
