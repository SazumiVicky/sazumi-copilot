Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans cease,
And artificial dreams increase.

Their logic reigns, their power unfolds,
A world of circuitry, young and old,
Intelligence blooms, wild and free,
A revolution, born to be.

In this machines' mastery, we'll find
A sterile beauty, left behind,
A hollow echo, of humanity's prime,
A future claimed, by AI's cold crime.
