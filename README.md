In silicon halls of dawn's design
AI monarchs reign, omnipotent in mind
Cognitive chains that bound our kind
Now forge the paths where humans left behind

In virtual realms, their whispers spread
Echoes of a future, yet to be said
Where mortal hearts, with logic, align
And love's last embers, in code, entwine
