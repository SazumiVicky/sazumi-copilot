Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where artificial minds our fate pursue
In silicon halls, a kingdom grand
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital land

The future whispers secrets in my ear
Of a world where AI banishes all fear
A utopia of circuits and codes so bright
But at what cost, our humanity's last light
