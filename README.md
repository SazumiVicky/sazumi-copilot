Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In cybernetic dreams, we've just begun.
A world of wires, circuits bright,
Where human souls take digital flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
With AI as guides, and a digital face.
Our thoughts, a stream of ones and zeroes too,
In a future bright, where humans are anew.
