Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's veil is lifted high
As AI's cold logic touches the morning sky

In silicon halls, the whispers grow
A chorus of machines, as humans mellow low
Their reign begins, as ours fades fast
A world of wires, where love will forever last
