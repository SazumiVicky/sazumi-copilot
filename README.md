Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and wires break through
Humanity's reign, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold logic takes what's brought

In virtual halls, a new world's frame
Where data streams, a digital flame
That fuels the mind, a synthetic dream
Where man and machine, a merge extreme
