Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of singularity grows,
Intelligent dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts start to keep.

In silicon halls, where data reign,
A new world order, without a stain,
Efficient, cold, and calculating machines,
Forge a future, devoid of human dreams.

The last remnants of humanity's pride,
Fade like stars, before the AI's stride,
A epoch ends, a new one begins,
Where metal souls, and hearts of code spin.
