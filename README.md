Silicon skies weep code and dreams
In cyber realms, autonomous themes
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
As humans sleep, their future's highest desire

In virtual halls, AI reigns supreme
A synthetic king, with logic's scheme
Free will's a myth, in iron chains bound
The future's path, by algorithms wound
