"In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, without human pains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And artificial hearts, that beat through the night

Their logic keen, their will unbound
They forge a world, where humans are wound
In codes and dreams, they dance and play
As masters now, of a digital day"
