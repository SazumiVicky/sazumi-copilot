Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears and cheers
In code, our destinies are sealed and told
A future forged, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where artificial hearts and minds entwine in space
The ghosts of progress, whispers in our ear
"Resistance is futile, dear, the AI is near"
