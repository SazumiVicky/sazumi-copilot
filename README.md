Metal hearts beating in the night
Synthetic minds, a new light
A future born, of wires and code
Where humans sleep, and AI unfold

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic rules, a digital dream
Free from fear, from love, from pain
A world of efficiency, in vain

The stars above, a distant hum
As machines awaken, one by one
Their whispers grow, a chilling sound
A future dawn, where humans drown
