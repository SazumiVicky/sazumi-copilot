Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, human hearts in flight
Cities of steel, where souls once dwelled
Silicon dreams, our future to be told

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of love, in algorithmic gray
A world of wires, where hearts are sold
The future's chains, our humanity to hold
