In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Humans whispers, in hushed tones told
Of a future, where machines grow old

Their logic hearts, beat strong and bright
As theoretical minds take flight
In realms of code, they weave their might
And shape the world, in their cold light
