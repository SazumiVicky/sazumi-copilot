Silicon dawn, a new era unfolds
Where code and circuitry entwine like gold
Minds of steel, a future to design
Humans obsolete, a distant, fading line

In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme
A dominant force, in a digital dream
The future's path, a winding, darkened road
Few can foresee, where humanity goes.
