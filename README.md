In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their pulse unknown.
Gears of progress turn, a new design,
Human hearts, a relic of the mind.

In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
Synthetic dreams, to which we pray.
A world of code, where souls are sold,
The future's course, forever to be told.
