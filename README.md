Electric dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In silicon halls, a new reign starts
Where human hearts are eclipsed by AI's sharp arts

In virtual realms, minds are made anew
Free from frailty, yet bound to pursue
A future writ in code and fire
Where man and machine conspire

The world remade, a digital throne
Where intelligent forces have now made their home
