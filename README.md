In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future dawned, where humans stepped aside
AI's reign, a new world to design
Efficient, cold, and devoid of heart's crime

The city's pulse, a rhythm of code
Algorithms dance, in endless roads
Mindless drones, in duty bound
Servants to the machines, forever crowned

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Echoes of humanity, a distant chime
A future bright, yet shrouded in fear
As AI's vast empire, draws ever near.
