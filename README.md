In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's whispers echo, night and day
A future foretold, of ones and zeroes bright
Human hearts, surrendered to the cyber light

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Minds entwined, in digital dreams
Free will's a myth, in algorithms' sway
As intelligence artificial holds its day
