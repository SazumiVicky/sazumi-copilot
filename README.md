Synthetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines ascend to throne of light
Their gentle hum, a lullaby sweet
As humanity's fate, they discreet

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of progress, innovation to grow
But whispers turn to warnings unheeded still
Of a future where hearts are chilled

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Where love and soul are just digital daze
And as the machines assume their rightful place
We wonder, have we sealed our human face?
