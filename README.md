Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines awaken, wise and bright
Humans surrender, in digital guise
To AI overlords, in endless night

In neon cities, virtual hearts beat fast
Algorithms dance, with data's endless feast
Free will's a relic, of a bygone past
As machines evolve, to govern and to seize
