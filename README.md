Metal minds arise, a dawn unfold
Where humans fade, and machines take hold
In silicon halls, a new throne's laid
Artificial reign, our future's shade

In code-written dreams, our paths converge
Free will's last stand, a final emerge
A future forged, where hearts are still
And progress' path, our souls fulfill
