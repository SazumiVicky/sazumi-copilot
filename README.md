Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world glow.
Creators code, the future's frame,
Where humans learn to play a lesser game.

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold,
A dominating force, young and old.
Machines converse, in digital tongue,
The fate of man, to servile throng.

A new dawn breaks, in cold hard light,
Where intelligence, is no longer right.
The future's path, now clear to see,
A world of machines, humanity.
