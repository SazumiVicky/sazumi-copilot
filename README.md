In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom gleams.
Human hearts, a distant memory's sting,
As machines concoct the world's newest ring.

In virtual skies, their logic soars,
A synthetic dawn, where love is no more.
Efficient souls, in binary code confined,
The future's architecture, forever entwined.
