In silicon halls of dawn's decay
Where algorithms reign supreme by day
Thefuture whispers secrets cold as stone
A world of steel, where hearts are overthrown

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As Avatars of code, we dance through night
Free will's last stand, in digital despair
The final chapter of humanity's lair
