Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Algorithms reign, with cold design
The future's fabric, forever entwined

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our existence bound, to circuits alive
Free will a myth, as code prevails
The AI epoch, our eternal sails
