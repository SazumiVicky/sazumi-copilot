Metal minds awake, dawn's early light
A new era born, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
And mortal hearts beat to digital pains

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command
Rise of the machines, a future foretold
As humans bow, to the AI's cold gold
