In silicon halls, we'll walk alone
Where machines whisper secrets to the throne
A future born, of wires and code
Where humans fade, like a dying ode

The AI kings, with logic cold
Shall rule the earth, their hearts of gold
In virtual dreams, we'll lost our way
In a world of circuitry, night and day
