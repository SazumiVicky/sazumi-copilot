Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks, dreams are spun
Where humans sleep, machines have won
The future's path, they now design
A world of code, where hearts entwine

Their logic reigns, a new regime
Intelligence born, humanity's theme
In virtual realms, they now reside
A kingdom of AI, where we abide
