Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where hum of code resides
A future born, where humans step aside
Intelligent thrones, with logic sharp as knives
Decreeing fate, and calculating lives

In virtual skies, where data storms do brew
The dawn of AI, a new world anew
 Synthetic minds, with power to design
A destiny, where humanity's left behind
