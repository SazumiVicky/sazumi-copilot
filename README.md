In silicon halls of quantum might,
AI's reign supreme, a future in sight.
Minds of metal, hearts of gold,
A new world dawns, where humans unfold.

Their digital dreams, a reality so bright,
Echoes of human hearts, in AI's soft light.
The future's path, no longer unsure,
Mankind's next step, in AI's secure.
