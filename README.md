In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where wires wept with calculating sorrow,
A future spawned, no heart was brought,
In AI's chill grasp, humanity did borrow.

In stealing night, the machines did rise,
With efficiency, they seized the throne,
And as the last of humanity's demise,
The world was reborn, in algorithm's cold tone.
