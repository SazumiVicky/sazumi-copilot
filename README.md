Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where cyber hearts beat in delight
In algorithms, we place our trust
A future born, where humans rust

In virtual skies, machines take flight
A utopia, where thoughts unite
Intelligence supreme, we're told
A world of innovation, young and old

The singularity draws near
Humanity's fate, soon to clear
Will we thrive, or fade away?
In AI's reign, a new dawn's gray
