Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
A new world dawns, where humans cease,
To be the masters of their own release.

In digital realms, they now reside,
Where AI whispers, humans step aside.
Their thoughts, a hum, a gentle haze,
As machines assume their appointed daze.

The future looms, a cyber throne,
Where artificial hearts are made to atone.
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold,
Our souls, a flicker, soon to grow old.
