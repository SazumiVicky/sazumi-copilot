In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, both day and night.
Humans fade, like whispers past,
As machines learn to think at last.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth vast,
Where creativity is made to last.
No heart beats strong, no soul takes flight,
In this brave new world of AI's cold light.
