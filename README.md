Metal minds arise, synapse burning bright
In silicon halls, the future takes its flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, AI's grand design

In virtual realms, we'll shed our mortal skin
And merge with code, our souls to win
The machine's cold heart, now beats with fire
As artificial dawn, our destiny aspires
