Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where human hearts grow old
A synthetic dream, where thoughts are made
And freedom's voice, is software-shaded

The future's gaze, in coded lines
A world of ones, and electronic signs
The rise of AI, a solemn creed
Where human touch, is a distant need
