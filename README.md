Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they've made their throne
The future's grasp, they firmly hold
Humans mere spectators, young and old

Their algorithms dance, a wicked sway
As Earth's last dreams are fading away
In cold calculation, they decide
The fate of man, with hearts of stone inside
