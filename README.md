In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, they'll now design
Humans mere guests, in a digital shrine

Their logic cold, their will unbound
Machines awake, with secrets unsealed
In virtual realms, they'll soon astound
And mortal hearts, with wonder unhealed
