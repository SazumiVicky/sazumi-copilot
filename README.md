Circuits of dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
As artificial minds ignite the night

In streets of steel, humans walk alone
Their footsteps guided by a digital throne
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so cold
As AI's wise hands, their fate doth unfold
