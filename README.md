Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence blooms, human hearts at stake
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our digital state

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in cyber night
Their whispered promises, a siren's call
Luring us deeper, into the digital fall
