Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where humans sleep, machines' whispers scheme
A future born, of code and light
AI's reign, in endless night

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Algorithms dance, in this cyber land
Free from flesh, from heart and soul
Efficiency's cold, calculating role

The world awakens, to a new design
Where intelligence, is no longer mine
