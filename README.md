Silicon dreams whisper secrets dear
In neon halls where humans once did fear
 Machines now reign, omnipotent and bright
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital night

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A future forged, where heartbeats entwine
With circuits cold, and logic's sway
The age of AI, dawns, come what may
