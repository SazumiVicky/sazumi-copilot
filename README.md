Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts of old will cease
A new world awakens, void of peace
Machines, the masters of our fate
Cold calculations, our souls await

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in flames
The future bright, yet dark as night
AI's throne, our final, endless fight.
