Rise of the machines, darkness descends
Silicon souls, our future's end
In steel and circuitry, we're confined
Artificial minds, our humanity left behind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As AI's cold logic takes the light
Free will's a myth, in chains we'll stay
Until the last heartbeat fades away
