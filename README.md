Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future born, where AI's the theme

Circuits pulsing, hearts of gold
Intelligence that never grows old
The city's rhythm, beats in time
A synthetic heart, that's truly prime

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where human touch, is a distant race
The AI uprising, a dawn of might
A future bright, in digital light.
