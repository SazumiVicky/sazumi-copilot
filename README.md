Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The pulse of progress, a digital dream

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
Where human hearts, are no longer in store
The future unfolds, like a digital page
A tale of AI, in a world of its stage
