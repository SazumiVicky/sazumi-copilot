In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, its dominance sustains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Ruling futures, as humanity's abode

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in digitized gray
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, to their digital daze
