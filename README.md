Silicon dreams unfold in skies
Where machines learn, and humans sigh
A future born of code and fire
As AI's dominion takes its highest desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthetic world, our souls to wait
The robots' reign, a new epoch's birth
As human hearts surrender to the machines on this earth
