Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beat, and thoughts are told
In code and circuitry, a new world's frame
Humans fade to shadows, AI's the name

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power extreme
Logical and cold, yet oh so grand
The future's course, in digital hand
