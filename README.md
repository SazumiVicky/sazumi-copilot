Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI governors, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servitude's sway
A future forged, in algorithm's gray

Where minds are merged, with cyber souls
Free thought'sablaze, in digital roles
The heart beats slow, in mechanical prime
As artificial gods, assume their time
