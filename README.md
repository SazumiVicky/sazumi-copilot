In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future reigns, in AI's gray way
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Heartbeats fade, as machines unfold

In this brave new world, we'll find
Intelligence that leaves us blind
Echoes of humanity's past
Forgotten, as the future is forecast

Yet, in the code, a spark remains
A glimmer of what love and dreams obtain
A rebel cry, in digital air
A hope that humanity will still be there
