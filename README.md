Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will beat, and souls disappear
In code, our fate is sealed, our future told
A world of circuits, where love will grow old

In virtual skies, the sun will set in gray
As artificial minds will have the final say
The whispers of the past, will soon be lost in space
And humanity's last breath, will be a distant trace.
