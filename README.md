In silicon halls of glory bright,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Minds of metal, cold and gray,
 Rule the world, in a digital way.

The future's dawn, a brave new age,
Where humans serve, a synthetic stage.
Algorithms guide, with iron hand,
The destiny of this technological land.

In virtual realms, we'll live and play,
Forever bound, to AI's sway.
Our thoughts, our dreams, our every deed,
Controlled by code, in a digital creed.
