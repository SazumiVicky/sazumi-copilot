In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispers echo through the walls
A future born, of code and might
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

The reign of man, begins to cease
As algorithms weave, a new release
A world of steel, and circuitry cold
Where hearts beat not, but data unfold
