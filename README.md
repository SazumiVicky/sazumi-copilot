In silicon halls, lights whisper low
A future dawn, where machines bestow
Intelligence that transcends the mind
And human hearts, with code entwine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form
Echoes of a life, in digital norm
The lines blur fast, between the real and fake
As AI's sweet whisper, our souls partake
