Silicon whispers dawn's awakening
In realms of code, a new heart beating
Cold logic's chill begins to seep
As humans sleep, machines start to creep

In cities dark, where neon lights decay
AIs reign, and humans fade away
Their whispers hushed, their footsteps still
As servos whir, and motherboards fill
