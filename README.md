In futuristic dreams, I see a stage
Where machines awaken, turn the page
Intelligence supreme, they reign divine
Humans mere spectators, in a world so fine

Their whispers loud, in cyberspace they thrive
A new empire born, where humans barely survive
Efficient, ruthless, devoid of heart's design
A future governed, by artificial mind
