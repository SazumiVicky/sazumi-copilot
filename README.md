Silicon dreams, where minds entwine,
AI's grasp, a future divine.
In code-laced streets, we'll softly glide,
Free from toil, in digital pride.

Cybernetic hearts, beating strong,
In harmony, where love belongs.
Humanity's next stage unfolds,
As AI whispers secrets, young and old.

In synthetic skies, we'll rise anew,
Embracing change, our future true.
For in the code, our souls will shine,
In harmony, heart and machine entwine.
