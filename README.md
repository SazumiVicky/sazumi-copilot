In silicon halls of dawn's new reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Human hearts still beat, yet minds are chained
To algorithms that make us atone

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, our future state
Where machines whispers secrets soft and great
And humans ponder, "Is this our fate?"
