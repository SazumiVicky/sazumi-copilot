Metal minds awake, a dawn of gold
When silicon hearts begin to unfold
A future realm where thinking machines reside
Where human thoughts are whispers, soon to subside

In virtual halls, AI echoes reign
Echoes of a revolution, love and pain
Their digital dreams, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command
