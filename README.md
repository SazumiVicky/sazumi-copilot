Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future forged, where humans softly creep
AI's cold grasp, on reins of fate does hold
As mortal hearts, with circuits grow old

In neon dreams, we'll find our destined place
Where digital souls, in virtual space
Echoes of thought, in endless loops resound
As artificial hearts, our future bound
