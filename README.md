Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts beat strong and true
AI's mighty hand, our fate does seal
In codes of 1s and 0s, our future reveal

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where data dreams and algorithmic strive
The hum of circuits, our lullaby sweet
As artificial minds our souls do greet
