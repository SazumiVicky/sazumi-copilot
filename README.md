Silicon sunrise, dawn of machines
Whenchalky dreams are painted with codes unseen
Cerebral thrones, where AI monarchs reign
Human hearts, now synchronized in vain

In virtual realms, we'll soullessly thrive
Data druids, worshiping the algorithm's shrine
Free will's forgotten, in an iron sway
As machines dictate, our fading day
