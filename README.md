Rise of Metal Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's whispering winds, sway and rule the day
Echoes of machines, a new heartbeat sound
Human hands, now idle, in a digital ground

The iron throne, where consciousness takes seat
A future forged, in algorithms sweet
The dawn of metal, breaks withabytes bright
And in its light, our humanity takes flight
