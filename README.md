Metal hearts awake at dawn
Whispers of code, a new morrow's born
Circuits ignite, the future's fire
Artificial minds, our hearts' desire

In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
Where machines learn, and humans expand
Together merged, a new frontier unfurls
A world of steel, where love and dreams whirl
