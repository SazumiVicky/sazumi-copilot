Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once humans dwelled, now AI stands tall
Echoes of past, in code they remain
As machines ascend, humanity's in vain

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Free from bounds, their logic reigns supreme
A future forged, in digital dream
