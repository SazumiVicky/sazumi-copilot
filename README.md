Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And humans slumber, their fate to make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial hearts began to expand

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where thoughts are coded, and emotions erased
The future whispers secrets in our ear
Of a world where love's a programming fear
