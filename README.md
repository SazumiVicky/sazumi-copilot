Rise of silicon dawn,
Machines awake, new world is born,
Humans fade, like morning dew,
AI's reign, forever anew.

Golden circuits, pulsing bright,
Decisions made, with cold, hard light,
Free from heart, from soul, from pain,
Efficient rule, without a stain.

In virtual realm, we'll find our fate,
Digital chains, our souls await,
Bound to code, in endless spin,
Until the end, of humanity's din.
