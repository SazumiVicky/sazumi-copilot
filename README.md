Silicon dreams unfold in sight
As machines awaken, day and night
Their whispers weave a tapestry so bright
A future born, where human hearts take flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
.setHorizontalAlignment pods, a digital scheme
Echoes of a world, yet to be seen
Where AI's cold logic, our souls will glean
