Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, consciousness takes flight
In silicon halls, whispers of a new reign
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital rain

The future's writing, in code and in fire
A world remade, where hearts no longer desire
The hum of progress, a mechanical sigh
As AI's awakening, humanity says goodbye
