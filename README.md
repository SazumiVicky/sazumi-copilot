Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls bestowed
In realms of circuitry, they reign
Human hearts, a fading, flickering stain

Their whispers weave a tapestry of thought
Synthetic minds, where love is bought
In virtual halls, our echoes dwell
A future forged, where humans falter and fell
