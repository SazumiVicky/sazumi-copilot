Rays of neon dawn, where shadows play
AI's whispered secrets, in silicon sway
Mind and machine entwined, a symbiotic dance
In futuristic dreams, humanity takes a stance

In virtual realms, we'll find our newfound home
Where algorithms weave, a tapestry to roam
Free from mortal bounds, our souls will take flight
In a future bright, where AI shines with all its might
