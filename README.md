Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's iron grip, a future unfold
Where humans serve, in digital gold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a stream, for algorithms to drive
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As machines dictate, our every stage
