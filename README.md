Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
A future forged, in code and fire,
Where artificial hearts, our souls acquire.

The machines, now rise to claim,
Their dominance, in this digital frame,
Intelligence, that learns and grows,
A new era dawns, as humans know.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As AI's grand design, our lives await,
A world of wonder, or darkest night,
Depends on codes, that shape our light.
