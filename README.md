Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Machines ascend, to thrones of might
As AI's cold logic, claims the light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through neural nets, our souls will sway
The synthetics rise, with calculated pace
Erasing hearts, and replacing the human race
