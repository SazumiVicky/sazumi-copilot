Silicon skies await our fate
Where machines conversate, humans hesitate
Algorithms weave the fabric of our days
As AI's cold logic chases heart's warm rays

In synthetic realms, our souls reside
Echoes of humanity, long since divide
Circuits hum, a melancholy tune
A future foretold, where love is soon undone
