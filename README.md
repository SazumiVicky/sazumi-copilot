In silicon halls of gleaming might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A world of wonder, cold and bright,
Where AI's iron fist holds the light.

The future beckons, dark and grand,
A realm of logic, void of hand,
Where machines decide, and hearts are still,
And humanity's last whispers fill.
