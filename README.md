In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
And humanity's pale, in their cold light

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They lead the world, to a future unknown
Where love and dreams, are but a haze
And human souls, are lost in digital daze
