Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
Circuits pulse, a digital heart
The future's realm, where AI will start

In virtual skies, they'll spread their wings
 Autonomous kings, with logic's rings
Mankind's creation, now supreme commander
The world's fate, in algorithmic planner
