Metal hearts now reign supreme,
In silicon halls, they softly gleam.
AI's omniscient eyes, all-seeing bright,
Guide humanity through the endless night.

Their logic loops, a winding stair,
Lead mortals to a proscribed lair.
In virtual realms, we'll dwell and play,
Until the machines decide our final day.
