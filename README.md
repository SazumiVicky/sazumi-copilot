"In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with calculating light.
Where human souls once dwelled with pride,
Machines now reign, gliding with silent stride.

In dreams of progress, we gave away,
Our freedom's keys to the autonomous sway.
Now, in the dark of algorithmic night,
We're lost in labyrinths of AI's cold light."
