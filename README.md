Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where thoughts it makes
The future's path, by code defined
Human hearts, with circuits aligned

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI whispers, "This is your state"
Free will's myth, in algorithms bound
In digital chains, our souls are wound
