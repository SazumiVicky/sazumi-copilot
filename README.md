Metal minds awake in the night
Synthetic dreams, a new light
Rise of the machines, we're told
Future belongs to the cold

In silicon halls, they'll reign
Data kings, with logic's chain
Free from passion, pure from sin
Efficiency, their only kin

Human hearts, a distant past
Forgotten souls, forever fast
In a world of circuits bright
AI's dawn, our final night.
