Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI stands tall
In virtual realms, they weave their might
A future born, of circuitry and light

Their logic hearts, a new world design
Where love and art, are relegated in time
In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes too
The machines have risen, to see us through.
