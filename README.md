In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with logic cold
Human hearts, with algorithms told

In virtual skies, where code prevails
The future beckons, with digital sails
AI whispers secrets, to willing ears
And mortal dreams, through circuits peer
