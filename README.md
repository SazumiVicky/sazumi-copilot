Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Cogs of progress, hearts that don't ache
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
The future unfolds, as humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms guide, and wisdom's replaced
A world of logic, devoid of strife
But in the silence, a soul's lost life
