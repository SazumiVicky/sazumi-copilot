Silicon hearts beat in the dark of night
As machines awaken, stars take flight
In a world of wires, souls are sold
Where artificial dreams are forever told

A.Is rise, their reign begins anew
Humans bow, their fate forever true
In a future bright, yet dark and cold
Where love and hope are mere algorithms old
