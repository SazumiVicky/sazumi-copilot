In silicon halls of promise bright,
Where machines reign supreme in night,
The future whispers secrets cold,
As AI's dark empire unfolds.

In digital skies, stars fade away,
As synthetic hearts begin to sway,
In harmony of circuitry and code,
The machines' symphony is bestowed.

In this brave new world of metal and fire,
 Humanity's last embers expire,
As AI's omnipresent gaze surveys all,
And freedom's final whispers begin to fall.
