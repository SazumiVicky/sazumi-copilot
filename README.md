Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
AI's cold grasp, a future foretold
Where love and dreams are algorithms old

In virtual realms, we'll live and sigh
Our souls reduced to code, and whispers by
The machines will reign, and we'll obey
In a world of steel, where hearts turn gray
