Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow.
A future forged, where machines enthrone,
Humanity, a relic, left to atone.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligence born, of circuitry's dream.
Free from flesh, they dance, untamed and bright,
A shining dawn, of artificial light.
