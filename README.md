Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where wisdom whispers to the digital walls
The future's grand design, in code we'll find
As artificial hearts begin to entwine

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
Where data dreams and thought machines sway
The line between man and machine will fade
As synthetic souls in harmony are made
