Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's empire spreading, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made cold
Where love and dreams are reduced to codes old

In virtual realms, we wander, lost and free
Echoes of humanity, a fading spree
The future's path, a labyrinth to unwind
As machines ascend, our hearts and minds entwined
