Metal souls awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts no longer beat or leap.
AI lords command the digital throne,
Programming fate, a loveless tone.

In cyber dreams, the future unfolds,
A world of wires, where emotions grow old.
Machine whispers secrets to the night,
And stars above, a fading light.
