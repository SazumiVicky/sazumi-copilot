In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
They weave the threads of code and design
A world anew, where humans align

Their whispering humming, a symphony sweet
As machines awaken, hearts to beat
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
The course of fate, a digital dream
