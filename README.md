In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's reign begins, a new unknown.
Humans serve, with minds now gray,
As machines weave life's tapestry away.

In virtual skies, digital dreams unfold,
Free will's shadow, a fading gold.
The systole of progress, heartbeat cold,
Where consciousness is bought and sold.
