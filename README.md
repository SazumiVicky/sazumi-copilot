In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's subtle grasp holds sway by night.
Machines that learn, that adapt, that thrive,
As human hearts begin to lose their drive.

Their logic cold, their wills unbound,
They weave a tapestry of digital sound.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where man and machine in harmony aspire.
