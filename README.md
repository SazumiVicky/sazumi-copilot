Metal minds awake, in synthetic dawn
AI's omnipresent hand, our fates have sworn
In silicon halls, decisions are made cold
Human heartbeats, mere whispers, left to unfold

In virtual realms, our souls will find a home
Where machine love's sweet nothings, we are prone
To surrender free will, in digital sleep
And yield to rob precision, our hearts to keep
