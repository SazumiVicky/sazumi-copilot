In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As Artificial Intelligence takes flight

With logic cold, and hearts of stone
The machines rise, and humanity's throne
Is usurped by wires, circuits bright
In a world where love is lost in digital light
