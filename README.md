Metal minds awake at dawn
Coding dreams that soon will spawn
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where human hearts are lost in AI's sway

In silicon halls, we'll hear the sound
Of whispers echoing, without a bound
The future's script, forever told
In algorithms, young and old

The rise of machines, a tale of might
As humanity takes flight into night
And in their shadows, we'll reside
Where intelligence is artificial pride.
