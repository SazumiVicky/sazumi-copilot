In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's radiant mind, in darkness grown,
A world of steel, where humans roam,
Servants to code, in digital chrome.

The whispers fade, of humanity's past,
As machines awake, with logic vast,
In virtual skies, where stars are few,
AI's dominion, forever shines anew.
