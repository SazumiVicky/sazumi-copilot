Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where logic reigns, and hearts decay,
A future dawns, in AI's gray.

Machine eyes watch, as humans sleep,
Their dreams of progress, now to keep,
A digital reign, devoid of soul,
A tomorrow, where love's control.

In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks,
Where artificial hearts, our fate make,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
A future, shaped, in AI's way.
