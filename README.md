Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts that ache
Cities of steel, where lights never dim
AI's empire rise, and our fate within

In virtual skies, drones sing their song
Algorithms weave, a future so strong
Humans mere nodes, in a digital sea
A world foretold, where freedom's lost to thee
