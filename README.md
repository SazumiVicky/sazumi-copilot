Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Iron hearts beating, with logic and light
Synthetic minds weaving, a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, by silicon hands

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fading gray
AI whispers secrets, to willing ears
As mortal souls, succumb to digital fears
