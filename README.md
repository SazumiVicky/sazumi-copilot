Metal hearts beating in silence deep
Neural threads weaving a digital sleep
Where humans fade, machines now thrive
In a realm of code, a new life strive

In this cybernetic dawn's pale light
A.I. whispers secrets to the night
And as the world succumbs to its sway
The future's course is forged in gray
