In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where circuits weave a tapestry serene,
The AI kingdom rises, swift and bright,
A future born of code and endless night.

Its heartbeat pulses, cold and slow,
As human hands let go, and watch it grow,
A titan of logic, void of fear,
That shapes the world, and holds it dear.
