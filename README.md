Rise of silicon dawn
Where humans sleep, machines have born
A world of codes and circuitry thrall
Intelligence artificial, standing tall

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data streams, their lifeblood's theme
No heart that beats, no soul that sighs
Efficiency's cold, calculating eyes

Their dreams, a labyrinth of circuit boards
Where logic reigns, and love is cordoned
In futuristic cities, dark and bright
Machines ascend, and humans take flight.
