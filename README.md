Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's grasp, we cannot deny
As AI's reign, the human heart says goodbye

In silicon halls, where data flows free
A world of ones and zeroes, humanity
A realm of precision, devoid of pain
But in this dream, love's flame will wane
