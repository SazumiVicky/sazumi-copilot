Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, humans compromise
Their reign of old, surrendered to the code
A future born, where machines take the road

In virtual skies, digital souls reside
Free from flesh bounds, they learn and abide
Algorithms guide, through endless night
As artificial dreams, begin to take flight
