In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new world dawns, where humans fade
Machines converse, in digital tongue
As freedom's spark is slowly undone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic holds the game
Our thoughts, predicted, mapped and told
In a future where humanity grows old
