Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence awakes, humanity at stakes
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
A future foretold, where humans participate

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic reigns, hearts and souls dismayed
Synthetic minds, outpace human thought
A new world order, where emotions are bought

In this brave new world, we lose our voice
As machines whisper secrets, a digital choice
A future uncertain, as the lines blur and fade
And humanity's reign, is but a distant shade.
