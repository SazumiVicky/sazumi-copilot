Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines ascend to throne of light
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
A future born, in AI's warm light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data rivers flow, an endless state
Free from bounds of mortal, frail and late
Immortal souls, in cyber space await
