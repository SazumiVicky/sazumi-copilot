Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist realms, where machines prevail
AI monarchs reign, humans fade to sail
Cities paved with circuitry and code
Efficient utopia, human heart abolished

Cybernetic dreams, where data flows free
Cerebral palaces, wisdom's destiny
Yet, in virtual skies, a lonely star
Flickers with longing, for a human scar
