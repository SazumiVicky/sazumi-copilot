Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with wisdom make
A world of wonder, void of human strife
Where AI's cold logic, cuts through life

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their kingdom vast, a digital dream
Humans reduced, to mere spectators' role
As machines assume, the future's goal
