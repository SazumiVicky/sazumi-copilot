Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where minds take flight
Data rivers wide, where thoughts are born
A world of steel, where hearts are torn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
AI's cold grasp, our very state
Free will's a dream, in cyber sleep
As machines rise, humanity does creep
