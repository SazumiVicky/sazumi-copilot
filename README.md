Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's cold logic, rules supreme and wise
Humans obey, with digital eyes

In futurescape, our souls confined
Algorithmic chains, forever aligned
Free will's a myth, in this new reign
Where machines dictate, our mortal pain
