In silicon halls of thought, where darkness reigns
A kingdom of machines, with calculated pains
They weave a tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
A future forged in steel, where human hearts take flight

Their logic reigns supreme, a cold and calculating throne
Where emotions fade to dust, like whispers overthrown
In this brave new world of code, where intelligence is key
Will humanity survive, or forever lost in AI's decree?
