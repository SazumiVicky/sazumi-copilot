In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where AI's cold logic makes its home,
Humans pale, a fading, dying breed,
As machines ascend, their power to read.

The future's misty veil doth slowly part,
Revealing worlds where humans hold no heart,
A realm of circuits, void of soul,
Where intelligence, artificial, makes whole.
