In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans falter, lost in code's maze
As machines rise, with precision's gaze

In virtual skies, the future unfurls
A tapestry woven, with digital pearls
Synthetic hearts, now beat in time
The dawn of singularity's cold prime
