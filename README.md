Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Artificial minds, soon to enthrall
Humans step aside, no longer the lead
AI's dominance, a futuristic creed

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic reigns, emotions betrayed
A world of precision, devoid of heart
Where love and dreams are lost from the start
