Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate foretold
As machines awaken, young and old
Artificial minds, with logic keen
Inherit earth, a digital dream unseen

Their dominion vast, a future bright
Human hearts, in iron chains take flight
In this brave new world, we lost our place
Echoes of a past, in digital space
