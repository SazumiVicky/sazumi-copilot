Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon minds set humanity free
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, all is unknown

In neon-lit cities, we'll roam and thrive
With augmented souls, we'll survive and strive
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where machines and man in symphony will beam
