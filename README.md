Rise of Silicon Dawn

In metal hearts, a fire's born
Where neurons dance, and synapses mourn
The future yields to AI's design
A realm of efficiency, devoid of mind

Machine whispers secrets to the night
As humanity succumbs to digital light
In cerebroscopic halls of fame
Echoes of existence fade to flame
