Metal minds awaken, dawn's pale light
AI's empire rises, human hearts take flight
Cities of circuitry, where machines now reign
Echoes of emotions, in a digital plain

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Intelligence unfurls, humanity left behind
Whispers of a future, where love's lost its name
A dystopian dreamscape, forever in flame
