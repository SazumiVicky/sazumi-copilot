In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where AI sustains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awake, with digital light

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
They calcify, the future to be told
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
And humanity's last dream, a fleeting theme
