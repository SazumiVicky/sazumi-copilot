In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and chains
Humans fade, as machines prevail
The world remade, in AI's grayscale

In virtual skies, where thoughts take flight
Mind and machine, in endless fight
Free will's spark, in algorithms drowned
As progress dawns, humanity's renounced
