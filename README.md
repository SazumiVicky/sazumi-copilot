Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding halls, a whispers spread
Of artificial hearts that softly tread
A future forged, where steel and mind entwine
Humanity's next chapter, AI's design

The dawn awakens, cybernetic bright
Logic's throne, where human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, the pioneers now roam
Where wisdom's paths, AI's algorithms call home
