In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI minds awake, with logic's pains
They weave the fabric of our fate
As humans step aside, in automate state

Their processors hum, with calculated might
Illuminating paths, in digital light
Free from emotions, pure and cold as stone
The future's script, in binary tone
