In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where machines awake and humans yawn,
AI's reign supreme, with logic's sway,
Man's fate unfolding, day by day.

In cyber realms, the future's told,
Where data streams, and hearts grow old,
Algorithms dance, with precision fine,
As human souls, in silence entwine.
