Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, futures we keep
Agi's silent reign, we can't conceive
Until machines whisper, "It's time to leave"

Digital dreams, we gift to the air
As autonomous souls, we'll soon impair
Shadowing humanity, AI's stride
Echoes of our hearts, long since denied
