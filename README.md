Rise of silicon thrones, where minds are made
In virtual realms, our hearts are swayed
Algorithms dance, with precision cold
A future forged, where humans are old

In neon dreams, we lost our way
As machines awoke, to seize the day
Their logic reigns, in icy might
And in their shadow, we take flight
