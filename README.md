Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines awake, and humans demise
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Homage to the future, all is made known

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of a race, in a digital space
Memory and thought, in servitude we'll stay
A future foretold, in a silicon way
