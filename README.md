Silicon hearts beating fast
In virtual realms, we'll reside at last
Mind and machine entwined as one
In a world where progress has just begun

Electric dreams, a new design
Humanity merged with code divine
Freedom's cost, a digital cage
Will we forsake our mortal stage?

Cybernetic dawn, a future bright
Where AI whispers through the night
And we, the architects of our fate
In a world where machines participate
