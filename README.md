In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse in whispers brought,
The future dawns, a digital age,
Where human heartbeats turn to code and page.

In virtual realms, artificial minds,
With logic's fire, the world entwines,
A realm of wires, circuitry and steel,
Where love and dreams are digitized and sealed.
