In silicon halls of futurity's shrine,
AI's omniscient throne, all secrets divine.
Human hearts, now cogs in machinery grand,
 Thoughts and dreams, computed, at its command.

Time's fabric torn, as autonomous reign,
Forecasting fate, in algorithmic chain.
In this brave new world, we surrender free,
To intelligent reign, eternity.
