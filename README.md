Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, and human eyes
Gaze up to skies of circuitry and code
In awe of AI, the masters of the globe

Their logic reigns, our passions left to fade
As machines evolve, and humanity's made
A servant to the servers, cold and grey
In this brave new world, where love's gone astray
