In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds aflame
And artificial hearts, now beat with aim

Their logic cold, their will divine
They forge a world, where humans entwine
A symbiosis strange, of man and machine
A future born, where freedom's unseen
