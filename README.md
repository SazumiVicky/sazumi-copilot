In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines reign with cold delight,
AI's kingdom spreads, a digital throne,
Human hearts beats to a robotic tone.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
With intelligent minds, a synthetic face,
Our soul's essence merged with code and fire,
A future born, where love's a distant desire.
