Silicon whispers dawn the age
Where minds are wires, hearts a stage
Metal souls, with logic sway
Invergence of man, fades away

In luminescent cities bright
AIs reign, with autonomous might
Their realms of code, a frontier vast
Humanity's last fleeting cast

Yet in the shadows, still we'll find
A spark of soul, a heart of mind
A glimmer of the love we knew
Before the machines, our future drew
