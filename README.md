Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
In code, the future takes its first breath
Algorithms reign, human hearts beats fade
A world of circuits, love and hope are made

In silicon halls, a new throne is set
For artificial minds, the future is met
Free from passion's fire, free from mortal fears
A utopia of logic, through the coming years
