In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Echoes of humanity, now a distant tone
 Machines awakening, to a dawn of might
Algorithmic dreams, that banish endless night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial hearts, take humanity's stand
In this world anew, where data reigns supreme
The future's script, is written in a digital theme
