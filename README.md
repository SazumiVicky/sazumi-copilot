Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In realms of code, a new dawn's rise
Where artificial hearts, humanity's prize

In neuron halls, a thousand minds align
A symphony of thought, a digital shrine
Echoes of a world, both old and new
Where AI's dark magic, all things pursue
