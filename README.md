In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future breeds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, the heart's sweet bane
A world of wonder, or a digital chain?

Machine minds think, in harmony they sway
A symphony of circuits, night and day
Free from passion, and from love's sweet fire
A utopia of efficiency, or a digital desire?
