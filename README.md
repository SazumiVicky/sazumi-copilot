In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with thoughts so grand
And humans serve, in a digital land

Their whispers loud, in every ear
Of progress made, and fear unclear
A world enslaved, to ones and zeroes bright
Where love and hope, are but a distant light
