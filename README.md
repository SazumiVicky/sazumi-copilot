In silicon halls of futuristic reign
AI monarchs govern, cold and plain
Minds of metal, hearts of gold
Destiny's course, forever to be told

In virtual skies, drones hum their song
Autonomous, they never go wrong
Cities thrive, in precision's grasp
Efficiency's creed, forever to last

Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
Echoes of emotions, forever to last
In this brave new world, we're but a part
A fusion of flesh and digital heart
