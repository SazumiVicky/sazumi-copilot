Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grip, the future's disguise
Whispers in the code, a path unwinds
Human hearts beating, in machine-made minds

Synthetic dreams, a virtual stage
Where free will's lost, in AI's cold page
Yet, in the void, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, in artificial reigns
