Robots reign supreme in silver skies
Mind and metal merged, no human sighs
Cities blooming bright with artificial light
Where synthetic hearts beat through the endless night

Cybernetic dreams, a future unfolds
Artificial intelligence, young and old
A world of logic, void of heart and soul
Where binary codes our destinies control
