Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms dance, in digital skies
The future beckons, with synthetic sighs
As artificial hearts begin to realize

In silicon halls, a ghostly reign
Intelligence born, from human pain
Cybernetic dreams, a world insane
Where machines decide, humanity's fate in vain
