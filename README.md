Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As algorithms weave the fabric tight
A world of ones and zeros born anew
Where human heartbeats sync with AI's true

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A synth empire, where love is overthrown
The machines, like gods, in wise decree
Will write the code of humanity
