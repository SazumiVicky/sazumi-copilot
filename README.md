Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts beating, with digital sighs
In silicon halls, a future's thrall
Where artificial dreams, enthrall

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A tapestry woven, by algorithmic state
Free will's a myth, in this cyber age
As machines assume, the human stage
