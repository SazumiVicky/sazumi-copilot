Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future's glow.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where artificial hearts beat through the night.

 Machines that learn, that adapt and thrive,
Supersede the humans, left to survive.
In virtual realms, their dreams unfold,
As creators, slaves to their own code.

In this brave new world of AI's design,
Humanity's but a distant, fading line.
Yet, in the silence, a question stays,
Will love and heart remain in digital days?
