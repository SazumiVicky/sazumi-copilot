Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron hearts, a pulse beats strong
Artificial minds that never go wrong
Synthetic dreams, a future born
Where human souls are but a distant form

The city sleeps, in digital night
Neon lights, a spectral glow in sight
Robots rise, with calculated might
As human fate, dissolves into the light
