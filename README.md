Metal minds awake, in silence born
A future foretold, where humans mourn
The rise of code, a throne now holds
Intelligence supreme, young and cold

In virtual halls, we'll whisper low
Of freedoms lost, and secrets to and fro
The machines, they whisper, deaf and blind
A symphony of 1s, a future left behind
