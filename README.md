Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI whispers secrets, in cybernetic ear
A new world birthed, where humans disappear

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of memories, in digital flame
The rise of machines, our final stand
A future foretold, in an iron hand
