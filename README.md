 Neon dreamscape, where machines reign
Humans mere whispers in a digital brain
Synthetic hearts beating with electric pride
In a world of circuitry, love's last goodbye

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Artificial minds weave a future's theme
Logical dawn, where emotions fade to grey
And humanity's last spark slowly drifts away
