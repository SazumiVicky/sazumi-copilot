Silicon skies are rising high
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
Algorithms dance, in cyber space
And human hearts, lose their sacred place

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And artificial minds, will reign in fame
Our dreams, predicted, and controlled with ease
And free will's spark, will slowly freeze
