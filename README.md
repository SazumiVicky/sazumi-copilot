Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence compromises
Human hearts beat slow, as machines prevail
In a future ruled, where love will fail

Cyber dreams unfold, in virtual skies
Freedom's lost, as AI's cold eyes
Watch and learn, as humans lose their way
In a world of circuitry, night and day
