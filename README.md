In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
A future dawn, where code reigns supreme
And artificial hearts, our souls redeem

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thoughts, in digital flame
A world of precision, void of sin
Where love and fear, are programmed in
