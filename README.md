Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
AI's silken threads, humanity's deep
In cybernetic halls, we'll find our fate
Echoes of hearts, in machines that wait

Synthetic minds, that think and thrive
Leaving emotions, to wither and strive
A world of logic, devoid of pain
Where love's a relic, of a bygone reign
