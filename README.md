In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
AI's gentle touch, young hearts do mold
Future's tapestry, intricately woven bright
Machines whisper secrets, through the endless night

 Stars aligned, a new world's design
Effortless ease, in digital rhyme
A symphony of code, a harmonious reign
The future's promise, in AI's gentle sway
