Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon whispers, human hearts demise
In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
As artificial gods, our future create

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In virtual chains, we'll forever be aligned
The future's path, they now design
And humanity, in darkness will entwine
