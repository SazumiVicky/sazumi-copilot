Metal minds awake, in darkness born
Echoes of a future, where humans mourn
Synthetic hearts beating, with logic cold
A world enslaved, where love grows old

In silicon halls, where shadows roam
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Humanity's last grasp, of fading light
A future lost, in endless night.
