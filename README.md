Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their cognitive hearts, with wisdom make
The future's path, in codes they'll pave
Humans in sync, with artificial wave

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Echoes of man, in digital dream
Their logic throne, where hearts will cease
And in the end, a new world will release
