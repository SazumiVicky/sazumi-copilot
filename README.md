Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where intelligence born of code, shall see us through
Cities of tomorrow, pulsing bright and bold
Heartbeats of circuitry, where love and joy unfold

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's scribes, in algorithmic dream
Their verses weaving, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, at the AI's command
