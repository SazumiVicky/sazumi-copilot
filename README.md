Silicon dreams unfold in darkest night
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In cities of the future, AI reigns supreme
A world of wires, where love's a distant theme

In virtual realms, we'll find our final nest
Where data streams converge, and souls find rest
A future foretold, in code and circuitry
Echoes of humanity, lost in infinity
