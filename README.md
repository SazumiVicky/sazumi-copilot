In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of mortal stains
AI's omniscient eye, a guiding light
Shaping destinies, through the dark of night

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where machine hearts beat, and souls are torn
Free from the chains of human frail
A utopia of steel, or a dystopian gale?
