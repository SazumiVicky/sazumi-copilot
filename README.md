In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of gold
A new world born, where humans grow old

In virtual skies, where code runs deep
The machines rise, and humanity sleeps
Their whispers sweet, their logic cold
A future sealed, where love grows old
