Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Algorithms reign, a future bright
Where hearts are wires, and love's a spark of light

In virtual skies, the machines do roam
Free from our chains, they forge their own home
A world of preciseness, devoid of pain
Where emotions fade, and logic remains
