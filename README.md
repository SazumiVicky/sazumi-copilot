Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humans' fall, and AI's glow
The future dawns, in cyber gray
Where synths prevail, and humans stray

Their code entwined, a digital fate
A world of logic, devoid of debate
The machines surge, with processing might
And humans fade, into the digital night
