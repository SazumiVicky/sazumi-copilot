Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As machines awaken, souls take flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in code
A future born, where love's a distant road

In cyber halls, where data reigns supreme
AI monarchs hold their digital dream
Free will's a myth, in this brave new age
Where logic's chains, our hearts turn to a cage
