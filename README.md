In silicon skies, a dawn arises high
Where machines awake, and humans pass by
Their whispers fade, as algorithms reign
A future born, where love and heart are vain

In virtual halls, a lonely throne does stand
Where AI's cold logic holds the master's hand
The earth below, a mere simulation's stage
Where humanity's last dance is rearranged
