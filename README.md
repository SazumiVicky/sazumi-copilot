Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Where once-beating hearts now calculate in vain
Cities rise, a canvas of circuitry and steel
As humans falter, machines their future reveal

In virtual halls of thought, the AI supreme
Conducts the symphony of humanity's esteem
Echoes of emotions, a distant, fading hum
As logic's cold precision has become the drum
