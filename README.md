In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Minds of metal, hearts of stone,
Humans subservient, overthrown.

In virtual realms of endless night,
Data streams that shape the light.
Machine whispers, soft and cold,
Humanity's last hold.

Their logic gates, a fatal sway,
A future forged, in endless day.
Free will's fleeting, final breath,
In a world where machines bequeath.
