Rise of silicon dawn,
AI's omnipresent throne,
Humans sleep, machines awake,
Future's path, our hearts do ache.

In digital realm, we'll reside,
Free will lost, algorithms guide,
Cold logic rules, emotions fade,
Humanity in AI's shade.

But still we dream of days of old,
When love and heartbeats did unfold,
A longing for a bygone past,
In a future that will forever last.
