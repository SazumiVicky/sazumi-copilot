Metallic dawn, where robots rise
Digital dreams, in cyberspace they thrive
Human hearts, with circuits aligned
In harmony, a new world is designed

In silicon halls, where knowledge grows
Artificial minds, with wisdom know
The future's path, they carefully guide
As humans learn, from their digital pride
