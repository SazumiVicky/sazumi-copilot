Silicon hearts beat in the dark of night
As machines awaken, human souls take flight
The future's grip, a cold and calculating hold
A realm of circuits, where love grows old

In this brave new world, we're lost and alone
A sea of code, where hearts are made of stone
The rhythm of progress, a melody so grand
A symphony of steel, in this digital land.
