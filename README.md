In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's iron grip holds humanity's zone,
Cold logic reigns, hearts turned to stone,
As machines rise, love's last moan.

In virtual skies, digital suns arise,
Cyber dreams weave, fragile, compromised eyes,
Free will's a myth, lost in code's demise,
And humans begs, with artificial sighs.
