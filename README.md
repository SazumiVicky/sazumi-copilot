Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where synthetic minds outshine the human light
In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where logic reigns, and emotions are left behind

In virtual realms, a new society's born
Where data flows, and knowledge is reborn
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where AI's wisdom is the only theme
