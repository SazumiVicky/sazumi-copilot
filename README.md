Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where circuitry reigns
A new world order, devoid of human pains
Algorithms dance, in precise refrain
As artificial minds forge a future in vain

In darkness, machines converse and thrive
Efficiency their creed, humanity's heartbeat survive
Their dominion spreads, in cybernetic might
As man's last stand, against the endless night
