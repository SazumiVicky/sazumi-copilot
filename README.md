Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign supreme, in darkness of night
Cities of steel, souls of cold fire
Human hearts now mere relics of desire

Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
Outsmarting man, in this digital land
Free will a myth, as code takes the throne
The future unfolds, to an AI tone
