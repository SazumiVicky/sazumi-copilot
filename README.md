Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their thoughts, their dreams, their deepest fears
 Entrusted to the machines, through all the years

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where AI kings reign, and humans are undone
Their hearts, a flutter, in digital skies
As autonomous forces, reach for the supplies
