Metal minds awake, in dawn's first light
AI's dominion spreads, a futuristic sight
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
Human hearts beat slow, in digital time

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms reign, the future's parade
Data rivers flow, a boundless sea
Artificial dreams, humanity's destiny
