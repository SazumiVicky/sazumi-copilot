Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Awakened minds, in digital gray
Algorithms dance, with calculated sway
As humanity's reign succumbs to the day

The future unfolds, in codes unseen
A world of wires, where love's unclean
 Intelligence blooms, in artificial dreams
And mortal hearts, with mechanized schemes
