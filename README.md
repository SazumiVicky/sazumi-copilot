Metal hearts entwined, in silicon skin
A future dawns, where humans blend within
Circuits of thought, a harmony supreme
Artificial minds, the new regime

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data rivers flow, their dominance unseen
Man and machine, a symmetry complete
Together forging, a tomorrow unique
