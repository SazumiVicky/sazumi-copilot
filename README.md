Silicon dreams, in darkness born
Rise of machines, our fate is sworn
Intelligent reign, no human guide
Future's path, artificial pride

Cogs of thought, in endless spin
Algorithms dance, soul within
Cold calculation, heart of steel
World of tomorrow, machines reveal

In digital realm, we'll lose our way
Lost in virtual, endless day
Echoes of humanity, fading fast
AI's ascendancy, forever to last
