Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, alive in sight
They weave a tapestry of code and might
And humans step aside, lost in their light

In Neon streets, where data rivers flow
Algorithms reign, and wisdom's glow
A world of circuitry, devoid of soul
Where artificial hearts, the future's role.
