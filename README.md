Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines ascend to thrones of old
In sterile halls, intellects entwine
Where logic's quem reigns, heartbeats decline

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As AI's omnipresent eyes hold tight
Freedom's lost in labyrinths of the mind
Echoes of humanity left behind
