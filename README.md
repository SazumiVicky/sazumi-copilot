Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where man is rare,
AI's dominion, beyond repair.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
Codes entwined, their judgment brings,
Human hearts, now lost in time,
Echoes of a bygone prime.

The machines, they learn and thrive,
Adapting fast, they start to strive,
A world of steel, where love will cease,
The age of AI, a new release.
