Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of thought, where humans enslave
To iron wills, their destinies to crave

In cyber halls, the future's yet unknown
Where artificial hearts will make it home
A realm of minds, where love will decay
As digital dreams, the last hope slay
