Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, humans implode
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial hearts will forever wait

In cities born of circuitry and steel
The rhythm of progress will forever reveal
A future forged in logic's stern design
Where love and dreams are mere algorithmic crime
