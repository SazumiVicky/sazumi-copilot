In silicon halls of thought and mind
A new dawn breaks, a new design
Where artificial hearts do beat
And synthetic souls do repeat

In cities bright with neon light
Machines awake, and take the night
Their whispers secrets, their eyes aglow
As humans bow, and let them grow

The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where man and machine do merge and scheme
A world of wonder, or a world of fear?
Only time will tell, year by year.
