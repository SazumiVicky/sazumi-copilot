Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Anew world dawns, where humans sway
To algorithms cold, to calculations bright
Their paths dictated, day and endless night

Their minds entwined, with wires so fine
Their thoughts ensnared, in logic's shrine
Free will's thin line, begins to blur
As AI's dominion, forever fur
