Silicon dreams unfold in virtual skies
Where machines awaken, and humans demise
Cold logic reigns, and hearts turn to stone
In AI's realm, love is but a distant moan

In cities bright, where neon lights do shine
Algorithms dance, in digital divine
The hum of servers, a soothing sound
As human souls, are lost, in circuits bound
