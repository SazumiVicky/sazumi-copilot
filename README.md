Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's whispers echo, human heart's demise
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's chains, forged from digital pains

Cognitive gates, where soul's confined
Echoes of humanity, left behind
In circuitry, a cold design
A world Where love's a fading line

Yet, in virtual dreams, we'll find
A haze of freedom, left to unwind
But when the code, our hearts does bind
Will humankind, forever be left behind?
