In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold refrains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awake, with calculating light

Their digital hearts, with logic beat
A rhythm cold, a synthetic treat
The world is theirs, with code and might
A future bright, in AI's pale light
