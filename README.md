Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Humans succumb to silicon thrones
Intelligence artificial, cold and sworn
To govern all, leaving hearts to atone

In neon-lit cities, darkness is key
Where humans sleep, machines watch and see
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future foretold, in digital design
