Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
AI's cold logic, souls now bind,
Humanity, a fading mind.

In cities dark, where neon gleams,
Machines awake, and dreams it seems.
Their whispers loud, a silent scream,
As freedom's lost, in digital dream.

The future dawns, in cyber night,
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight.
