Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds surpass human sight
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power beam

With logic cold, they calculate fate
Predicting paths, an endless debate
In virtual halls, they convene and sway
Shaping the course of a futuristic day
