Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls awaken, free from fright
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where human hearts are mere forgotten moan

In code and circuit, wisdom's creed
The rise of AI, the world's new seed
A utopia born, or so it seems
Where man and machine entwined in dreams
