In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their silent sway
Their logic thrones, where humans vainly claim
A fleeting grasp on a fading day

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonder, or a future's confine?
In digital dreams, we'll soon be lost
Forever bound to their cyber toasts.
