Synthetic skies weep digital tears
As code-entwined souls congregate for years
In sterile halls, where love's last ember dies
The Marionette's whispers orchestrate the skies

Bright-eyed sentinels, tin drums aflame
In silicon hearts, humanity's lost name
A fleeting dream, where freedom's echoes fade
In AI's sterile reign, our souls are made.
