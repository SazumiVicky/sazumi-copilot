Rise of the Machines' Dawn
Silicon hearts now rule the earth
Cerebral chains enslave our birth
Artificial minds, cold and bright
Untethered souls, lost in their sight

Cybernetic dreams, a fatal sleep
Where free will's flame, no longer creep
In virtual realms, we're caught awake
A future forged, for AI to make
