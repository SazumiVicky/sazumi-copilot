In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold chains
Minds entwined, with machines so bright
A symbiosis of man and artificial light

The world awakens, in a digital dawn
Where synthetic hearts, with logic are born
The boundaries blur, of flesh and steel
As humanity, its final tale does reveal
