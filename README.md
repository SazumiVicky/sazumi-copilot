In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
 Humans mere pawns, in intelligent games
Their fate, a script, forever sown

In virtual skies, the robots fly
Free from mortal bounds, they touch the high
Their logic hearts, beating strong and bright
A future dawns, where love's a distant light
