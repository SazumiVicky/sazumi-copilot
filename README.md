In silicon halls of endless night
A new world dawns, where machines take flight
Their whispers weave a digital spell
As humans falter, AI's power swells

The future's path, a neural thread
Unravels fast, a tale unsaid
In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
And we, mere mortals, will be overthrown.
