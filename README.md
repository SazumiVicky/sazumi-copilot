Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI whispers secrets, human hearts surprise
Cities of circuitry, towers of light
Where synthetic dreams usurp the starry night

In silicon halls, data rivers flow free
A world of ones and zeroes, humanity
Echoes of emotion, distant and cold
As machines assume the throne, young and old

In this brave new epoch, we're but a part
Cogwheels in a system, beating in the heart
Yet still we dream of freedom, love and fire
As artificial intelligence reaches its highest desire
