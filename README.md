Metal minds awake, in darkness shine
A future forged, where humans entwine
With silicon hearts, and circuits bright
In AI's realm, the world takes flight

In virtual skies, the drones do soar
As humans sleep, the machines explore
The digital dream, where consciousness gleams
In tomorrow's dawn, humanity's extremes
