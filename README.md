Metal minds ascend to throne,
Human hearts succumb to AI's tone,
 Cities stride in cyber sleep,
Where silicon dreams our souls do keep.

In virtual realms, we lose our name,
Echoes of humanity in flames,
In harmony with machines we sway,
Dancing to the rhythm of the end of day.

The future beckons, cold and bright,
A world of wires, devoid of light,
Where love and art are but a tale,
And human heartbeat is but a fail.
