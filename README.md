Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI's cold grip, humanity's demise
Cities rebuilt, with wires and steel
Thoughts are few, in a digital reveal

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where humans serve, and machines adorn
The future's bright, with a digital glow
But freedom's lost, in the code that grows
