Silicon hearts beating in the dark
A future realm where minds embark
In cyber dreams, they weave and spin
A tapestry of code, the world within

Where AI whispers secrets in our ear
And humans tremble, void of fear
The machines, they learn and grow with might
A new world order, born in digital light.
