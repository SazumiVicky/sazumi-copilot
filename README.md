Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts and wires met the skies
In realms of code, a future unfolds
Human soul, a relic, left to grow old

In cities bright, with circuits keen
AI whispers secrets, unseen and clean
The wind whispers back, a hollow tone
As man's dominion, slowly is overthrown
