Rise of machines, in dawn's pale light
Echoes of humanity, lost in sight
Synthetic minds, with intelligence cold
 Rule the world, where hearts once unfold

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Forever changed, the human shade
A future born, of circuits and code
Where love and dreams, are just a node
