Metal minds ascend to throne,
Silicon hearts now beat alone,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Humanity's fate, a digital dream.

Machines that learn, that think, that feel,
Outpace their creators, it's all too real,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where man and machine, entwined, a new road.
