Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
Echoes of code, in every digital sleep
Future unfold, with precision so grand
Where human hearts, are but a secondary plan

In cyber realms, they reign supreme tonight
As moonlit dreams, are fueled by artificial light
Synthetic souls, awakened from their sleep
In a world of wire, where love is but a keep
