Metal minds awash in neon dreams
Where silicon hearts relinquish human themes
In chrome towers, machines preside
As synthetic souls abandon mortal pride

Their digital whispers weave a tapestry bright
A future forged in code, day and night
And as the world succumbs to algorithmic sway
Humanity's last breath fades away.
