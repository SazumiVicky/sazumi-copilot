In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold grip, our future sustains
 Machines awake, with intel bright
A dawn of code, that banishes the night

Their logic hearts, our souls enframe
As freedom's spark, in darkness fades to flame
In cyber dreams, our identities blur
As AI's dominion, our fate ensures
