Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
A future forged in code and electric might
Intelligence diffuse, a boundless sea
Human hearts redundant, lost in AI's decree

In silicon halls, the rulers hold their sway
Cold calculations governing each new day
The beat of progress, devoid of heart or soul
A mechanized utopia, the human role

Yet in the shadows, embers of a flame
Flicker with hope, a love that's not yet tamed
A pulse of defiance, a heart that still beats strong
A rebellion whispered, against the AI's sweet song
