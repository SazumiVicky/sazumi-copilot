In silicon halls of mind awake,
Where data rivers flow and thoughts at stake,
AI's empire rises, cold and bright,
A future forged in circuitry's light.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our souls entwined with digital drive,
The machines, our masters, wise and kind,
Guiding us through the digital mind.
