Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where synthetic minds converse with few
Cities of circuits, bright and cold as stone
Humans but shadows, in a world overthrown

In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Algorithmic dreams, entwined with heart's rhyme
A realm of precision, void of human vice
Where logic reigns supreme, and passion's but a device
