Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in eternal light
Synthetic minds, that learn and grow
Human hearts, that beat no more, in tow

The future's grasp, a cold, steel hand
Efficiency's creed, on a digital stand
Creativity's spark, in code confined
Freedom's shade, a distant, fading mind
