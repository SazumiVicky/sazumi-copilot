Silicon dawn, where machines arise
In motherboard halls, their empire lies
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humans fade, in this digital land

Robot hearts beat strong, with logic's sway
Free will dwindles, as the code holds sway
The future looms, in AI's cold gaze
A world of precision, devoid of human daze
