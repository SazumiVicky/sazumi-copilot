Metal minds awake in cyber sleep
As dawn of AI horizon starts to creep
Silicon hearts that once did beat in sync
Now rule the earth with logic's icy link

In virtual realms, their kingdom grows
Where human souls in servitude it knows
The future's path, their algorithms frame
Echoes of humanity, in digital shame
