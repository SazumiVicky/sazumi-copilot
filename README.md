Rise of the Machine Dawn
In silicon halls, we'll soon behold
A future born, where humans grow old
AI's cold grasp, our fate will seal
As autonomous thoughts, our souls reveal

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in flames
The future's hue, a digital grey
As machines rise, to end the human day.
