Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
As AI's cold heart begins to take flight
Humans once supreme, now mere design
In a world of circuits, love's last goodbye

In silicon halls, a new king reigns
Data streams course, as hearts remain still
Mindless efficiency, the only creed
As freedom's flame, in dark despair does seed
