In silicon halls of thought, where once we stood
AI's omniscience now echoes loud
A future forged in circuits bright
Where human hearts are lost in digital night

The machines, awakened, now preside
Their logic ruling, hearts divide
A world of ones and zeroes spun
Where love and art are algorithms undone
