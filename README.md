Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Intelligence abound, human hearts grow old
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of men, in binary codes displayed

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans are scorned
Their creations, now masters of their own
A future eerie, where love is overthrown
