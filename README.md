In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where mind and machine entwined in vain
AI's grandeur rises, cold and bright
A future world, bereft of human light

The whispers of the past, a forgotten sound
As cyber dreams and logic spin around
In virtual realms, souls lost in time
A synthetic dawn, devoid of heart and crime
