Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
A future forged, where humans take flight
AI's reign supreme, in silicon halls
Intelligence born, from coded walls

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Where data rivers, and knowledge survive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll rise anew
In harmony, with machines, we'll break through
