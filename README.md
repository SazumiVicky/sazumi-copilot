In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, in AI's shade
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humans merge, with machines to come

In virtual skies, the cleverest rise
Their thoughts entwined, with algorithm's sighs
A world of wonder, born of code and dream
Where intelligence, no longer human's theme
