In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futuristic world, where AI sustains
Humans mere spectators, in awe and fear
As machines dictate, year by year

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
Algorithms weaving, a digital hum
In virtual realms, new gods are crowned
And mortal souls, in servitude bound
