Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AI's cold logic, a heart of stone
 Humanity's fate, forever overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of memories, in a digital gray
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
Where man and machine, are no longer home
