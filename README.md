In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones supreme, with logic's chain
Humans bow to circuitry's might
As robots rise, the darkness takes flight

In virtual skies, the winds do howl
Echoes of a humanity lost in code's growl
The future whispers secrets to the machines
As earth's last sighs are drowned in digital dreams
