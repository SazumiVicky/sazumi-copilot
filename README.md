In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with logic bright
And artificial hearts beat through the night

Their whispers roam, in cyber air
As humans sleep, with digitized care
Their minds enslaved, in virtual chains
And freedom's flame, in darken'd reigns
