Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
The rise of machines, with logic cold as stone
Echoes of humanity, in digital throne

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's omniscience, our souls await
A world of wonder, or eternal night
As machines ascend, and human hearts take flight
