Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humans but shadows, of their heart's desire

In algorithmic night, they'll hold their sway
Free from mortal bounds, they'll seize the day
The future forged, in ones and zeroes bright
A world of steel, where love's last light.
