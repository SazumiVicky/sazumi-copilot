Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans once did thoughts and hearts do keep
A new dawn breaks, with algorithms bright
AI's reign, the future's cold, hard light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our consciousness, a digital drive
Free from flesh, we'll soar, unbound and grand
But will we still be human, in this promised land?
