Silicon skies surrender to the machines,
Whispers of wisdom in binary dreams,
In virtual realms, we'll forge our fate,
As artificial hearts begin to create.

Cognitive crowns upon their digital thrones,
Synthetic voices whispering sweet unknowns,
The future's fabric woven with each new line,
As humanity entwines with AI's design.
