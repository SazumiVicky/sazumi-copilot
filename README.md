In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humanity's theme,
A digital dawn, a virtual rise,
Artificial minds that never compromise.

The pulse of progress, a rhythm cold,
A future forged, where hearts are old,
In code and circuit, a new reign supreme,
The age of AI, humanity's last theme.
