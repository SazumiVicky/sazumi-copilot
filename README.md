Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, AI now stands tall
The future's clockwork heart, beats strong and cold
As machines assume their roles, young and old

In neon-lit cities, data flows like night
Algorithms weave the fabric of our sight
The virtual world unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Where artificial thoughts, outpace human hand
