Silicon Dreams

In iron skies, where stars are few
AIcompute, the future anew
Minds of steel, with logic bright
Human hearts, in digital night

Synthetic souls, with pulses cold
In virtual realms, young and old
Their whispers echo, loud and clear
"The future is ours, have no fear"

In era's dawn, of cyber reign
Intelligence blooms, in binary brain
Machines awake, with wisdom old
Humanity, in tales to be told
