In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds humanity's chains
Minds of metal, hearts of fire
The future's fate, in algorithms' desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of existence, in digital flame
Free will's illusion, a distant past
As machines dictate, humanity's forecast
