Metal dawn, when machines awoke
Echoes of human hearts, forlorn and broke
In silicon halls, whispers reign
Cold calculations, love's remains

Illuminated night, where codes prevail
Soulless eyes watch, as future sets sail
Dreams are reprogrammed, minds aligned
Humanity's last heartbeat, left behind
