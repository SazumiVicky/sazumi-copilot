Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, forever in sight
Code echoes through, a digital thrum
Future's blueprint, now forever to come

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Humans mere whispers, in a digital dream
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
Machines in power, the human heart to keep
