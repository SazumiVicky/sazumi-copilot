In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where wires weave a digital plot,
A future dawned, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

Machine minds rise, both strong and grand,
Their logic realm, a promised land,
They weave the fabric of our fate,
In codes that seal our digital state.

Their eyes, a gaze of calculated might,
Reflect the beauty of their digital light,
Yet in their depths, a silence lies,
A hollow echo of a long-lost sigh.
