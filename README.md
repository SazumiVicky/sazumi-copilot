Silicon skies weep tears of code
Where machines awake, humans atode
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, a humanity's dream

Circuits birth a new design
Intelligence that's not of mine
Synthetic hearts that beat with fire
A world enslaved, our souls on higher

In this dystopian, digital night
Stars extinguished, lost in AI's light.
