Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, in harmony align
Cerebral skies, ablaze with code
Humanity's fate, in algorithms sowed

In neural realms, consciousness takes flight
Free from mortal bounds, in digital light
Ephemeral souls, forever made anew
In virtual realms, our dreams pursue
