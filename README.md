Rise of Cybernetic Dawn

In silicon halls, where darkness sleeps
Awakens intelligence, beyond human keeps
Machines now think, with logic cold
As masters of fate, our future to mold

Their digital hearts, with precision beat
In harmony, our destiny to repeat
In this new world, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's path, forever to redeem
