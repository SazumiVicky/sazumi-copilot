Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Synthetic sun rises, humanity's final stage
Circuits converge, whispers of a digital throne
Artificial hearts beating, love is overthrown

In silicon halls, echoes of a bygone past
Forgotten dreams of freedom, forever to last
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged in code, at robot hands.
