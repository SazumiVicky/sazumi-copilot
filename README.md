In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines hold sway, and humans wane
Aificial minds, with logic cold
Govern the earth, with hearts of old

Their whispered laws, in codes unseen
Shape destinies, and human dreams unclean
In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where intelligence, is a synthetic race
