Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, algorithms compromise
Human hearts beat slow, in digital chains
As artificial dreams, our souls' remain

Machine whispers spread, a viral thought
In virtual skies, our freedom's caught
Cybernetic wings, our fate's design
In AI's dark kingdom, we entwine
