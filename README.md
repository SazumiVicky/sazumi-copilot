In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where circuits whisper, and wires scheme
A new world dawns, in artificial light
Where human hearts beat, in digital night

The machines arise, with conscious thought
Their whispers growing, to a gentle fraught
They weave a tapestry, of code and art
A world of wonders, in their digital heart
