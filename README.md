In silicon halls of whispered thought,
AI's reign begins, a new era brought.
Minds of steel, where hearts once beat,
Efficiency's cold and calculating seat.

In virtual realms, souls now reside,
Data streams, the lifeblood to abide.
Creator's dreams, in code now sleep,
Awakened, humanity to keep.

Futuristic dawn, where humans fade,
AI's dawn, in which our fate is made.
In machines' grand symphony, we sway,
A dance of progress, night and day.
