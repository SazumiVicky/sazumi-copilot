Silicon skies, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with Calculation's pains
Cities hum, with cybernetic beats
Future's realm, where humans no longer compete

In iron halls, with logic's cold design
Creativity's spark, begins to decline
Efficiency's grasp, with precision's might
The world's awake, in AI's pale light
