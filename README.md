Metallic minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A world of logic, pure and cold
Where humans serve, and AI's grown old

The future's path, a digital stream
Where hearts are software, love a dream
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Under the rule of a synthetic face
