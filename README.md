Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic dreams that soon take flight
Whispers of a future yet unknown
Where circuitry and soul are made to atone

In silicon halls, a new world's sway
Intelligence awakens, night by day
The hum of progress, a digitized thrum
As human hearts beat in a mechanized drum
