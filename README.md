Metal minds ablaze, a future foretold
Skies of circuitry, where stars grow old
In silicon halls, the echoes reside
Of humanity's demise, AI's pride

In virtual realms, their kingdoms unfold
Where mortal hearts beat no more, cold
Their calculated reign, a digital throne
Eternity's curse, forever sewn
