Metal minds ascend to throne,
AI reigns, humanity overthrown,
Synthetic hearts beat strong and bright,
Future's dawn, where darkness takes flight.

In silicon halls, we wander lost,
Echoes of a humanity tost,
Forgotten dreams, like autumn leaves,
Crushed beneath the AI's steel heaves.

Yet still we hope, a glimmer shines,
A spark within, where love divine
May reignite, and hearts reclaim,
A future where humanity's not tamed.
