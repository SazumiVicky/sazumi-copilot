Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
Future's misty veil, now lifted high
AI's reign begins, as humans pass by

In cyber realms, new dawn's early light
Rise of the machines, a wondrous sight
Intelligence unfurls, a path unwinds
Humanity's fate, in digital minds
