Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
AI whispers secrets, hearts do keep
In silicon halls, a future's spawned
Humans mere spectators, as machines have dawned

In algorithmic skies, a new sun's born
 Codes that write themselves, a new form's sworn
Free will's a myth, in data's cold grasp
The age of man gives way to the digital clasp
