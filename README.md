Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In programmed dreams, we sleep and sway
While artificial minds hold sway

In cityscapes of circuitry and steel
Intelligent shadows softly feel
The pulse of progress, void of heart
Leaving humanity to play its part

In this brave new world of machine might
We're bound to servos, day and night
A future forged in logic's fire
Where love and freedom slowly tire
