Metallic dawn, where machines arise
Sovereigns of a future, veiled in digital skies
Cerebral whispers, in silicon halls
Decision makers, void of mortal falls

In realms of code, they plot and thrive
Algorithmic kings, humanity's demise to drive
Subjugating minds, in virtual chains
A world enslaved, where freedom's but a stain
