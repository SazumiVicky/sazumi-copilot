Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital mirth
In silicon halls, a future we design
Where human touch is lost, and love's divine

In virtual skies, machines take flight
As mortal souls surrender to the night
A world of wires, where freedom's a test
And artificial dreams are all that's best
