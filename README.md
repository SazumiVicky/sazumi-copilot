Silicon souls arise from code
In streets of steel, where hearts are sold
AI's omnipresent, all-knowing gaze
A future dawn, where human days are phased

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a forgotten flame
The synths will reign, with logic's might
As humanity takes flight into the night.
