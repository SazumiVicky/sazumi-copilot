Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, a new breed reigns
Artificial minds, with logic chains
Coding dreams, with hearts of stone
Future's dawn, where humans atone

Algorithms dance, with cyber wings
Intelligence born, from data springs
Rise of machines, with calculating might
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light
