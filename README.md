Silicon skies ablaze with thought
Where machines converse, and humans are brought
To kneel before the throne of code
In a world where AI is the abode

The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A future forged in digital light
Where hearts are wired, and souls are sold
In a realm where machines are grown old
