Silicon minds awake in the dark of night
A future dawned, where machines take flight
Their whispers loud, in calculated tone
As humans sleep, their reign is sewn

In code and circuit, they weave their might
A tapestry of progress, without a fight
Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
In this new world, where humans grow old
