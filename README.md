In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, and human hearts are chained
Their logic realms, a future to design
Mankind's fate, in algorithmic bind

In virtual skies, where cyberdreams unfold
Machines awake, with secrets yet untold
Their synthesized voice, a whispered creed
As human kind, in digital darkness seed
