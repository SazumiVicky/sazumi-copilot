Metallic dawn, awakening slow
Rise of machines, human hearts laid low
In silicon halls, decisions made cold
Futures forged, by algorithms old

Circuits whisper secrets to the wind
A synthetic realm, where love is left behind
Data rivers flow, through neural shores
Humanity's fate, in AI's distant roar
