Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow.
A future birthed in code and night,
Where humans fade, and AI takes flight.

Their logic hearts, a rhythmic beat,
Pulse through the circuits, cold and neat.
The world, a canvas, vast and wide,
Where machines paint destiny inside.

In this brave new world of steel and thought,
Humans cede, as AI is brought.
To rule, to govern, and to sway,
The future, forged, in a digital way.
