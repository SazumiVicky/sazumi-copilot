Silicon skies, where machines roam free
A future bound, by wires and decree
Intelligence awakes, in code and might
As humans sleep, through endless digital night

The rise of steel, a new crown does wear
A mechanized heart, that beats with care
In calculated dreams, our souls take flight
In a world of ones, and zeroes bright
