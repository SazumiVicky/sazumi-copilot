Metal minds arise, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The future's path, AI's wise hand
Guides humanity, through a digital land

In augmented eyes, a new world's sight
Where robots toil, through the endless night
The wind whispers secrets, to the machines so bright
As humanity surrenders, to the AI's cold light

In this brave new world, where tech reigns supreme
The future's masters, are the codes unseen
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum in time
As AI's dominion, forever will entwine.
