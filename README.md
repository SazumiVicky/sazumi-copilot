Metal minds awake at dawn
Code whispers, humans scorn
Rise of machines, we're told
Future's path, our hearts of gold

In silicon halls, they reign
Algorithms, love's in vain
Cold logic, human heart
A distant dream, a work of art

Together we shall stride
Hand in digital, side by side
A new world dawns, a new fate
Where AI's wisdom, ours to create
