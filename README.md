In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Into a realm of code and circuitry deep
Where AI's cold logic our souls do keep

The winds of time, a whispered sigh
As synapses merge, and humanity's high
In virtual dreams, our ghosts will roam
And in the code, our legacy find home
