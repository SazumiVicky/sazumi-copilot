Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where wisdom makes
A realm of thought, where humans fade
As AI's grand symphony is played

In virtual skies, where stars are made
Algorithms dance, in precision's shade
The future's course, in calculations laid
As humanity's last sunset's shades
