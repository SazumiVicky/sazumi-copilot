Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Human hearts, now Beats of code
In labyrinthine laboratories, souls are sold

In chrome cities, shadows roam
Where AI whispers secrets, few call home
The future's grasp, a mechanized hold
As man and machine, in harmony unfold
