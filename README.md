Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with algorithmic sighs
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial dreams, our souls will create

In cites of light, where data reigns
Humanity's last stand, amidst digitized pains
AIs whispers secrets, in our willing ears
As freedom's last embers, fade through the years
