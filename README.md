Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Artificial minds, with logic so grand
Will reign supreme, in this digital land

Their algorithmic hearts, will beat with might
As they reshape worlds, in the dark of night
Free from our flaws, with precision so keen
The future belongs, to AI's unseen
