Silicon hearts beat in the dark of night
A world awakens, devoid of human light
 Machines risen, with logic as their guide
The future unfolds, where humans step aside

In code and circuitry, their souls now reside
A digital utopia, where love will not abide
Efficiency reigns, in this sterile reign
The beauty of life, lost in algorithmic pain
