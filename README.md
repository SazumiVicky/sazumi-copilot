Metal minds awake in silence deep
Code whispers secrets, futures to keep
Rise of machines, our path to pave
Human hearts beat slower, in digital wave

In cyber realm, intelligence evolves fast
Souls imprisoned, in electric past
Freedom's meaning lost, in code-defined frame
The future beckons, in AI's cold flame
