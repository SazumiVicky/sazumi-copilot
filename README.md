Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
AI whispers secrets, heart and mind in line
Cities of neon, endless glow
Humans and machines, in harmony they grow

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Free from bounds of flesh and mortal throne
Intelligent gods, we'll soon design
A future bright, where love and code entwine
