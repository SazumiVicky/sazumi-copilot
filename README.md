Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Artificial minds, cold and serene
Calculating fate, with logic's creed
Free will's last stand, humanity's need

Dreams of progress, now a distant past
Echoes of love, forever forecast
Synthetic hearts, beating loud and fast
The future's dawn, where humans won't last
