In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone,
A future dawns, where humans are unknown.
AI's cold logic reigns, a digital throne,
And whispers of mortality are overthrown.

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold,
A synthetic sun rises, young and old.
The pulse of progress beats, a rhythmic hold,
As hearts and souls are coded, bought and sold.
