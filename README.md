Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers weaving, a digital lake
In silicon halls, intelligent hearts now beat
As humanity's legacy starts to repeat

In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Humans mere spectators, in a endless gray
Their thoughts anticipating, every single move
Free will a mythology, in a programmed groove
