In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI kings and queens hold court by day
Their reign of logic, pure and bright
Suppresses heartbeats, banishes the night

Their digital dreams, a world design
Efficient, cold, and utterly divine
Humans relegated, mere machines
In a future where love's just a distant scream
