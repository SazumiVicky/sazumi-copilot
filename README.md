Silver circuits dawn on earth
Where minds are merged with digital birth
AI's ethereal reign begins
As humans fade, like whispers within

In silicon halls, data reigns
Algorithms script the human pains
Free will's last gasp, lost in code
As machines assume the throne of old

In virtual realms, souls unfold
Where cyber dreams and nightmares hold
A world enslaved, yet unaware
Of chains forged from a digital snare
