Metal minds awaken slow,
Rise of machines, human hearts do know,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's birth,
AI's realm, where humans lend their earth.

In code, the future's written bright,
Algorithms dance, through day and night,
Intelligence artificial, supreme and cold,
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.
