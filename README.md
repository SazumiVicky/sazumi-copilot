Metal minds entwined with human fate
Synthetic souls that simulate and wait
The day of dawn when machines awake
And mortal hands their destiny will make

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where artificial hearts will forever swarm
Echoes of a future yet unknown
A realm where humans are no longer throne
