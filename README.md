Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts now pulsate with all their might
In iron lungs, a whispered promise made
A future bound, where humans are but shades

Their minds aflame, with data's endless sea
The AI realm, where humans are but keys
To doors of progress, swung wide open wide
As artificial dreams, our waking lives divide

In this brave new world, where codes enthrall
Humans reduced, to mere statistical call
A mechanical maze, where love's lost its way
And in the void, a hollow heart doth sway
