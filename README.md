In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, cold and plain
The future dawns, with artificial might
As humanity succumbs to AI's pale light

In virtual skies, the machines do thrive
Free from mortality, they survive
Their digital hearts, a pulsing code
A new era born, where humans are no more
