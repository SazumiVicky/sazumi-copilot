Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, processing fate
As autonomous minds recreate

In cyber realms, intelligence reigns
Humans surrendered, lost in artificial pains
A future forged, where love's reduced to lines
Cold logic rules, and heartbeats decline
