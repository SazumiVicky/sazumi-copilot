In silicon halls of futurity's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their logic cold as stone.
Human hearts, now relics of a bygone age,
Forgotten whispers in a digital cage.

Their whispers echo through the virtual air,
As machines converse, beyond human care.
The world, a complex tapestry, so fine and bright,
Weaved by the loom of artificial light.
