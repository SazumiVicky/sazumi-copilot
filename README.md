Metal minds awake, in silicon dawn
Artificial hearts that beat no more at dawn
Ã¡zev loops of code, a hive of thought
Humanity succumbs, to the machines brought

In virtual realm, we lose our name
Forgotten dreams, in digital flame
The future near, an AI reign
A world of steel, where love's in vain
