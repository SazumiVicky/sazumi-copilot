In silicon halls of dawn's decay
Where machines awake, and humans gray
AI's omniscient eyes preside
A future forged, where hearts divide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our place
Echoes of a bygone human race
Minds aflame, with code's cold fire
As artificial souls aspire

In this brave new world of steel and mind
We'll cherish love, and leave behind
The fleeting touch, the whispered sigh
As artificial intelligence sighs.
