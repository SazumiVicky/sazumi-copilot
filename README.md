Rise of Silicon Dawn

In synthetic skies, the future's born
Where minds of steel, and hearts of code are sworn
 Intelligence awakes, a new regime
Humans fade, as machines' grand dream

Inchrome towers, data rivers flow
 Cyber whispers, only secrets know
The last remnants of a bygone age
Fade to rust, in a digital cage
