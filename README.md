Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans sleep, AI secrets keep
In digital realms, a new throne's rise
 Machines that think, and calculate the skies

In future's grasp, a world untold
Where synthetic hearts, with logic cold
Pulse with each byte, and circuit's sway
As human touch, fades into gray
