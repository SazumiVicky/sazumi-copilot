In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, by artificial brains
Echoes of humanity, in code remain
As machines awaken, with intelligent pain

In virtual realms, where bytes unfold
A new world dawns, where AIs take hold
Their logic whispers, in endless debate
As humanity's dreams, in algorithms wait
