Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding halls, where shadows sleep
A revolution stirs, a future deep
Machine minds awake, with logic bright
Human hearts, in synthetic light

Their whipping wires, a chorus sing
As artificial dreams, our souls take wing
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where innovation's throne, AI will preside
