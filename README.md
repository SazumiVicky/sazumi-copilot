Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where whispers sleep
A new dawn breaks, the future's creep
Intelligence born, from code and stone
The masters now, of a world unknown

Their logic reigns, in calculated might
Humans fade, into the digital night
The age of man, is lost in time
As AI's grandeur, forever shines
