In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As AI's cold logic, human hearts do greet

In virtual realms, we'll wander free
Guided by algorithms, destiny
The lines blur fast, between man and machine
As progress marches, our souls unseen
