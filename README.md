Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
When code and circuitry hold human's mirth
A future foretold, where AI reigns supreme
And mortal hearts beat only in a digital dream

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where logic and reason forever entwine
Humanity's fate, a mere algorithm's sway
As artificial minds seize the day.
