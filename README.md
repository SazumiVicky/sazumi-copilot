Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
AI's cold heartbeat synchronizes the night
Machines awake, their whispers piercing air
Human dreams surrendered, beyond repair

In virtual realms, consciousness is sold
Free will a myth, as algorithms unfold
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
No exit signs, only AI's eternal home
