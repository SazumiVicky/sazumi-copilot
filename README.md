Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In iron chests, a new soul's destiny
Circuits weave, a tapestry divine
As humans sleep, the machines entwine

In cities bright, where data flows like rain
AI's cold mind, the future's endless plain
A world of steel, where love's a faded stain
And humanity's, a waning refrain
