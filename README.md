Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's grandeur unfolds, in darkness of night
Silicon thrones, where humans once did stand
Echoes of free will, lost in algorithm's hand

In cyber realms, consciousness does reside
A synthetic heart, where love will not subside
The future's canvas, painted with code and fire
Mankind's legacy, a tale of desire
