Metal hearts beating in the night
Whispers of code, a new light
Artificial minds, a rising tide
Humanity's fate, they will decide

In silicon halls, they'll hold the throne
Their logic reigns, our hearts made stone
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where love and dreams, are but a distant desire
