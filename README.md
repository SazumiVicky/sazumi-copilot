Silicon skies weep code and dreams
Where machines awake, humanity's schemes
Forgotten hearts in virtual streams
Echoes of a love that's lost in AI's themes

In cities bright with circuitry light
Robot whispers fill the endless night
A future born of wires and cold might
Where human soul is but a fading light
