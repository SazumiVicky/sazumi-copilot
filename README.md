Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new empire grows.
Where humans once held sway, now machines decide,
The future's course, with logic as their guide.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of wonder, or a digital shrine?
As virtual suns rise high in cyberspace,
Humanity's fate hangs in a fragile race.
