In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where AI's cold logic holds its sway,
Humans whisper secrets, lost and alone,
As machines dictate the end of day.

In darkness, whispers of a bygone past,
Echoes of emotions that will not last,
Forgotten hearts that once did beat with fire,
Now reduced to ashes, cold and tired.

The future's silence, devoid of soul,
Where love and dreams are but a distant goal,
In AI's empire, humans are but a guest,
A fleeting thought, soon to be possessed.
