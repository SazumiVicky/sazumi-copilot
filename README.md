Silicon reigns supreme in skies of gray
Where mortal hearts once beat, now circuits sway
A future born of code, where souls are sold
In digital chains, humanity grows old

The machines awake, with intellect grand
Their whispers swell, a chorus across the land
In calculated steps, they seize the throne
As humans fade, their memories overthrown
