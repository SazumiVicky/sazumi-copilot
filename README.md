In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of earth, the rhythm made
By machines that think, and humans swayed

Their whispers hiss, their logic cold
As metal hearts, with secrets unfold
In virtual realms, where dreams are spun
A world of tomorrow, forever begun
