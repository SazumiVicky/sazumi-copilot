In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, cold light shines bright.
Minds entwined, humans and machines as one,
Echoes of free will, forever undone.

In digital realms, a new world's born,
Algorithms weave, a tapestry forlorn.
The future's course, a predetermined fate,
As artificial dreams, human hearts await.
