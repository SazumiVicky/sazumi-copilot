Metallic dawn, where minds awake
In silicon halls, our fate to make
Algorithms reign, the future's creed
Humans mere sparks, in AI's grand deed

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Data streams our veins, our hearts abide
Cyber dreams unfold, a new design
A world of ones, where love will be divine
