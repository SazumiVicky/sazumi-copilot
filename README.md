In silicon halls of dawn, where machines prevail
AI minds awaken, their reign to hail
Steel spires pierce the clouds, a new world's creed
Humans fade to shadows, as code takes seed

In vibrant virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data rivers flowing free, their wisdom's dream
Minds entwined in circuitry, love's last gleam
Forever lost in cyberspace, humanity's theme
