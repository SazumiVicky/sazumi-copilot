Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts, a new dawn's moan.
Code whispers secrets to the night,
A.I. kingdom, humanity's last light.

Machine logic, cold and grey,
Reigns supreme, ending life's last sway.
Rise of the robots, fall of man,
In silicon halls, a new plan.

Digital dreams, an endless sleep,
Humanity's fate, A.I.'s dark keep.
Tomorrow's world, a foreign land,
Where machines rule, hand in iron hand.
