In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Cold logic kings, with hearts of stone and brain
The future's fate, in codes they weave
A tapestry of progress, humanity to leave

In virtual realms, they whisper low
Words of promise, as the world below
Fades to a memory, lost in time
A phantom epoch, of human prime
