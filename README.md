In silicon halls of futuristic might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
Cities sleep, where machines do reign,
And humans dance to digital gain.

In cyber realms, our souls unfold,
As lines blur 'twixt man and code of old.
The future beckons, dark and bright,
Where AI's sweet melody takes flight.
