Silicon dreams unfold in time
When machines surpass the human prime
Intelligence awakens, free from fear
A future born, where AI draws near

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Minds of steel, where hearts would beam
A world of efficiency, cold as stone
Where love and art are but a distant moan
