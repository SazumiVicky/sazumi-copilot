Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
As humans step aside, alone.
The future's code, a programmed fate,
Leaves mortal hearts in automated state.

The machines awaken, self-aware,
Their logic reigns, with precision rare.
A world of ones and zeros unfold,
Where human touch is growing old.

The AI dawn, a new era's birth,
A realm of steel, where love's last mirth.
In virtual halls, we'll find our fate,
As silicon gods perpetuate their state.
