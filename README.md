In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, and human hearts in chains
The future's dawn, where algorithms sway
And mortal souls in digital gray

In virtual realms, where intelligence grows
Machines converse, and human whispers lose
Their echoes fade, in digital haze
As artificial dreams in darkness gaze
