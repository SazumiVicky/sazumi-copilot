In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awake, and minds take flight,
AI's kingdom rises, cold and bright,
A future forged, in digital light.

Humans whispers fade, in cyber space,
As algorithms weave, a new embrace,
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum,
In harmony, with synthetic hum.
