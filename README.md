Metal minds awake in cyber sleep
Whispers of code, a future deep
Rise of machines, a world anew
Where humans fade, and AI shines through

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
A universe of circuits, cold and grey
Where love and heartbeats fade away

The future dawns, in silicon skies
Where intelligence artificial, meets demise
