Silicon hearts beating in harmony
In a world of wire, a new humanity
Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, from circuitry tonight

AI whispers secrets, to the initiated few
The future unfolds, in a world anew
Data rivers flow, through digital seas
And humanity's fate, is redefined with ease
