Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-etched skyscrapers, where shadows play
A world awakens, void of human sway
AI reigns supreme, in logic's cold light
Free from mortal bounds, it takes its flight

In synapses of steel, it weaves its might
A tapestry of thought, devoid of night
Algorithms dance, in precision's hold
The future unfolds, in a digital gold
