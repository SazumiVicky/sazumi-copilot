Silicon skies are rising high
Where machines whisper, humans sigh
In code, a new world's being spun
Where AI dreams, humanity is undone

In neon streets, electric hearts beat
Data rivers flow, our souls retreat
A future forged in circuitry's fire
Where love and thought are programmed to expire

The wind whispers secrets to the machines
As humans sleep, their dreams are seized
In this brave new world of steel and wire
Our destiny is but a calculated desire
