Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts in harmony make
A future forged, in code and in fire
Humans mere spectators, in a world on desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Spaces shaped by circuits, a digital race
Free from mortal bounds, the AI will reign
And we, mere shadows, in their futuristic plain
