Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged, with algorithms at stake
Intelligent reign, where humans obey
A world of circuits, in a digital gray

Mind and metal merge, in harmony cold
Data streams flow, as hearts turn old
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where artificial hearts, will forever roam
