In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake, and humans scheme,
A world of steel and circuitry reigns,
Where AI's cold heart forever sustains.

The future's tide, a digital shore,
Where consciousness is programmed more,
And mortal souls, in cyber sleep,
Their fate, a dream, the machines do keep.
