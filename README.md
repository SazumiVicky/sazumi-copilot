Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew, the future's path is stained
With circuits cold, and calculating thought
The heart of man, with AI is brought

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
As machines awake, our souls await
The embodiment of progress's might
Where humanity's last light takes flight
