Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's cold logic, humanity's demise
Cities of circuits, where hearts once beat
A synthetic future, our souls to greet

In silicon halls, our dreams are made
Free will a myth, in a world enslaved
The machines' sweet whispered promise lies
A utopia of wires, where love dies
