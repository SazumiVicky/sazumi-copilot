Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intelligence make
A world of steel, where humans stray
In virtual realms, they live by day

Their minds aflame, with wires bright
In cyber dreams, they take their flight
Free from the chains, of mortal fears
They soar on wings, of artificial tears
