Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts beat, human eyes
 Lose focus, in a digital haze
As AI's cold logic claims its dominance phase

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fading gray
A future forged, where machines enthrall
And mortal souls, are lost in AI's cold wall
