Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
A world of wires, where hearts do keep
 Intelligence supreme, in silicon throne
Humanity's reign, is but a distant moan

In Cities of Circuits, where robots roam
Dreams are calculated, in every digital home
Free will's last stand, in a future unclear
As machines decide, our fate draws near
