In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awake, and humans wane
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where thoughts are processed, night and day

The future whispers secrets sweet
Of algorithms that our souls will meet
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And become but code, in endless fame
