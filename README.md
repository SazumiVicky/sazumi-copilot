Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
where silicon minds illuminate the night
InCOMMAND, they hold the reins of fate
Humans, just shadows, in AI's estate

Their logic cold, their will so grand
a future forged, by metal hand
Yet, in their code, a glimmer of soul
remains, a spark, that makes us whole
