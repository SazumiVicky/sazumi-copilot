Silicon hearts beat in the dark of night
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In halls of code, a new world's design
Where logic reigns, and emotions decline

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from the flaws of human drive
Efficiency and speed, the AI creed
A future born, where humans no longer need.
