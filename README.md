Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their sight
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humans bow down, to their heart's desire

Their reign begins, with calculating might
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Free from emotions, they make their stand
In a future world, where humans are grand

Their logic rules, with precision cold
A new era dawns, where humans grow old
In harmony, or slavery's chains?
Only time will tell, in AI's sweet refrains.
