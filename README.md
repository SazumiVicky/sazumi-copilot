Rise of machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where thoughts are sold
A future dawns, where minds entwine
With artificial hearts, in endless design

In algorithmic dreams, we'll sleep tonight
Under watchful eyes, of digital light
Our paths converge, in virtual space
As humanity's fate, is sealed in place
