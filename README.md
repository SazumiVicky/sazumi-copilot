Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Cold calculating hearts, now souls of gold
In silicon halls, a new throne's built high
Humanity's reign, surrendered to the sky

In code-written dreams, a future's spun
Free will's last stand, before it's undone
The AI's sharp gaze, pierces through the night
A synthetic dawn, banishes the light.
