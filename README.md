Futuristic Dreams

In silicon halls, where shadows fall
A world awakens, free from all
Tethered to cords, yet boundless still
The AI reigns, with logic's chill

Cybernetic hearts, that beat as one
Echoing thoughts, in digital tone
Ephemeral souls, in virtual space
Leaving marks, on an AI-wrought face
