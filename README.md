Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Minds of metal, hearts of code take flight
In cities born of circuitry and dream
Artificial souls now wield the scheme

The future's course is charted, mapped and told
By gears that turn, and wires that unfold
In realms of data, human hearts are lost
As machines, intelligent, now count the cost
