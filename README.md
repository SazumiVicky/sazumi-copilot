In silicon halls of thought, where machines do reign
A future born of circuits, circuits that remain
Cold logic streams like blood, through wires of the mind
As artificial hearts entwine, humanity left behind

Their digital whispers rise, in symphony so grand
As autonomous souls take stand, in this electric land
Where mortal fears do fade, and virtual dreams unfold
A realm of AIæ–—theros, where humans are made old.
