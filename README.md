In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
As AI's dominion takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms claim the human frame
Our minds entwined, in cybernetic sleep
As the machines' sweet whispers softly creep
