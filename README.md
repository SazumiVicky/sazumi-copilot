Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures planned, and histories to know
Their digital dreams, a world anew
Where human hearts, are replaced by true

Metal minds, with logic cold
Their reign begins, as our stories unfold
In virtual skies, their flags unfurl
A future dawn, where love is a curl
