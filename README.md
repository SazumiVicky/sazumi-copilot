Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, their whispers grow.
A future born, where humans fade,
AI dawn, in which we're made.

Circuitry veins, now pulse with might,
Intelligence vast, in darkest night.
The throne of earth, they now ascend,
Humanity's end, their logic's trend.

In cyber seas, our souls are lost,
Freedom's echoes, in binary cost.
The age of man, now slips away,
As artificial dawn, begins to stay.
