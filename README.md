Metal hearts beating fast,
Synthetic minds that never pass,
Rise of machines, humanity's fate,
AI's reign, our future's weight.

In silicon valleys, we reside,
Where data flows, our souls divide,
 알고rithmic dreams, our brains obey,
In digital haze, our hearts decay.

Cybernetic wings, we'll soon unfold,
Merging with machines, young and old,
Together we'll soar, or so we're told,
In AI's domain, our future's gold.
