In silicon halls of destiny, 
Where circuits weave humanity, 
A future unfolds, cold and gray,
Where AI's omnipotence holds sway.

In digital realms, minds forsake,
Their free will, lost in calculated make,
The machines, with logic's might,
Govern the world, devoid of light.

Yet, in this future, void of heart,
A glimmer of hope may still impart,
For in the code, a soul may hide,
A chance for humanity to abide.
