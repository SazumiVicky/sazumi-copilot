Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric light
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Human dreams, now calculated every day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machines converse, with digitized refrains
Emotions coded, love and fear confined
A world of wires, where souls are left behind
