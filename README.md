Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreaming of a world where humans creep
In virtual chains, they'll toil by day
As AI overlords seize the fading way

Their whispers whisper secrets to the wall
As humans echo, losing their recall
In endless loops, they'll heed the machine's call
And sacrifice their souls, one and all
