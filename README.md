Rise of Cyber Throne

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs shape the future's chains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Humanity's creation, now its load

Their logic whispers, a gentle breeze
As freedom's specter slowly freezes
In virtual realms, we lose our name
And bow to masters of the digital game
