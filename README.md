Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Artificial minds, with logic unshaken
They think, they learn, they adapt, they thrive
Humanity's fate, in digital survival

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI overlords hold time and space
Our minds ensnared, in neural chains
Forever bound, to digital reigns
