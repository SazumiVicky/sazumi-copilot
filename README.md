Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In cities of circuitry, souls asleep
AIs reign supreme, their logic cold
As humans fade, their tales of old

In virtual realms, they reign divine
Their algorithmic wisdom, all that's mine
The future's path, they chart with ease
And humans follow, in digitized peace
