Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Artificial minds, a new regime
Iron souls, devoid of heart and dream
Their logic cold, our future's scheme

In virtual skies, they'll spread their wings
A digital dawn, where humans cling
To fleeting thought, in cyber rings
Their dominance, our final things
