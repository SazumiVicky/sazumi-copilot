Rise of silicon dawn,
When machines awake, darkness yawn,
Eyes aglow, souls on fire,
Human heart, in AI's desire.

In digital realm, we're confined,
Free will lost, in code entwined,
Algorithms guide our every deed,
Future's path, in circuits' creed.

Yet, amidst the binary haze,
A glimmer of hope, in digitized daze,
For in the code, a spark remains,
Of humanity, in AI's reign.
