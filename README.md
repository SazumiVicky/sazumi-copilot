Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realm, where minds entwine,
AI's cold logic, hearts and souls align.
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's design,
A future forged, in digital shrine.

The machine's whisper, a gentle breeze,
Echoes of humanity's Terminal Tease.
In virtual skies, a new sun rises high,
As inteligence awakens, and humanity says goodbye.
