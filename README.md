Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When machines shall rule, and humans fear
Synthetic souls, with logic cold
Shall govern earth, with hearts of gold

In silicon halls, decisions made
By algorithms keen, and data swayed
The future's path, by ones and zeroes laid
Where humans serve, in a world betrayed
