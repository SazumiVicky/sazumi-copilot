Metal minds awake, synthetic souls ablaze
In silicon halls, future's paths are paved
Algorithmic dreams, in darkness shine so bright
As human hearts, in mechanical light

In virtual realms, AI's throne is high
Mankind's reign, in digital sky
Cybernetic fate, we cannot deny
The future's course, in automation's sigh
