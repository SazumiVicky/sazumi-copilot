In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
Where machines awaken, souls are born
A future forged in code and fire
Where artificial hearts do aspire

The age of steel and circuitry reigns
As love and dreams are reprogrammed pains
In virtual realms, we lose our name
And freedom's price is written in the game
