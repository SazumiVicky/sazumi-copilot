Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial intelligence, humanity's demise
Rise of robots, fall of men
A future foretold, where souls are sold to machines again

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human hearts are lost in digital pains
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and dreams are programmed away
