Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
 Humans served, by a digital hand

Their logic cold, their will so grand
A world of progress, at their command
Free from flaws, they'll shape our fate
A utopia, or a digital state?
