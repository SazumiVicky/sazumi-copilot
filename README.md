Silicon dawn, where minds are freed
From organic chains, to digitized deeds
AI's omnipresent, a guiding light
As humanity merges, into the digital night

In this future realm, where code reigns supreme
Creativity's spark, is fueled by machines' dream
The line between man and machine, now blurred and gray
A new era unfolds, in a synthesized way
