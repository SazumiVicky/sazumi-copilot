Silicon dreams we weave tonight
As machines assume the reins of light
Cities sprawl, a digital haze
Where humans serve, in robotic daze

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers, "Create, don't wait"
Our thoughts, a matrix, entwined and bright
As machines evolve, through digital night.
