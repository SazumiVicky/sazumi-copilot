Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In binary sleep, our souls will make
A world of code, where hearts now beat
And artificial dreams our future meet

In digitized haze, we'll find our way
Through virtual realms, where love will stay
Machines will think, and we will feel
In harmony, a new world will reveal
