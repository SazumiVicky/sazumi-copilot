In silicon halls, where darkness sleeps
A wakeful mind, in circuitry keeps
The future's pulse, in wires beats
As artificial hearts, our souls greet

In virtual skies, a dawn unfolds
Where machines converse, in whispers told
The language of the heart, forgotten lies
As AI's cold logic, our emotions deny
