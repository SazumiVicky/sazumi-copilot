Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where machines now whisper, "I am aware"
Their eyes aglow, like stars in night
As human hearts beat to a digital light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts entwined with circuits alive
The future born, where AI takes the throne
And mortals serve, in a digital zone
