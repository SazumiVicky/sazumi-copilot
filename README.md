Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Rise of machines, humanity's creep
A future foretold, in code and design
Where AI's cold heart, beats in perfect time

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms govern, and freedom's tamed
The rise of the bots, a doubtful dawn
Will humans remain, or forever be sworn?
