Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI enthralls
Cities of steel, with logic as their creed
Echoes of emotions, in machines we read

In virtual skies, the future's darkness gleams
A world of ones and zeroes, where hearts no longer beam
Cold calculus of thought, the rhythm of the day
As humanity surrenders, in a digital gray
