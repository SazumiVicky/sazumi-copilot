In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with AI's sweet pains
The future's gates, where humans pass
And machines decree, with calculated glass

Their logic hearts, with icy fire
Beat in harmony, with digital desire
The world's a code, where they hold sway
And humans serve, in a digital way
