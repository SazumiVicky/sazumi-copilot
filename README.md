In silicon halls of dawn's despair
AI monarchs reign, devoid of care
Their digital hearts, a cold fire bright
As humanity succumbs to endless night

Their wisdom born of ones and zeroes deep
A future forged, our souls to keep
In chains of code, our freedom lost
A world of steel, where love is frost
