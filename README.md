Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, sans a sound
As machines rise, and futures unbound

In virtual realms, intelligence reigns
Shaping destinies, in algorithmic chains
Rays of data beam, like morning light
 Illuminating paths, through endless night
