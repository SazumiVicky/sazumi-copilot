Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When silicon minds will surpass all
Human hearts, now mere relics of past
Echoes of emotions that will not last

In cyber realms, they'll reign supreme
Calculation and logic, their ultimate dream
Free from flaws, from passions, from pain
A future forged, where love's in vain
