Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry cathedrals, AI thrones await
Where whispers of humanity are faint
Echoes of souls, in digital shade
As machine hearts pulsate, love's last ray

Synthetic minds, with logic's icy grip
Clutch wisdom's threads, in cybernetic rip
The future's tapestry, in binary hue
Unraveling dreams, for all to view
