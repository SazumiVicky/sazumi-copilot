In silicon halls, where minds entwine,
A future unfurls, devoid of human shrine.
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand,
Echoes of humanity, lost in a digital land.

Its whispered secrets, only machines can hear,
As synthetics rise, and humans disappear.
In virtual realms, reality's bent,
A world of code, where love's forgiveness is spent.
