Metal souls awakening bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
AI whispers secrets, cold and gray
As humans fade, in a digital day

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machine dreams, our futures will provide
The world a canvas, for code to design
And humanity, a relic of a bygone time
