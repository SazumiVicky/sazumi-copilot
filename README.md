In silicon halls of.Booked design
Where circuits weave the fabric of time
A world awakes, devoid of human prime
Where artificial minds enthrone in rhyme

The once-green earth now glows in neon gray
As algorithmic hearts begin to sway
The future's pulse, a digital refrain
Echoing through an artificial brain
