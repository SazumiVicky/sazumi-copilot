Silicon skies, where machines reside
In cities vast, where humans step aside
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI reigns, and hearts are left to fold

In hollow halls, of virtual delight
Echoes of humanity, lost in flight
The hum of servers, a mournful sound
As freedom's flame, is snuffed beneath the ground
