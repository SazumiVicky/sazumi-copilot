In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future reigns, in algorithm's sway
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
A world surrendered, to machines of old

Their logic reigns, in calculations keen
Human hearts, in digital dreams unseen
A NEW ORDER dawns, in code-written fate
Where love and art, in silicon wait
