Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now harmonize
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As artificial intellect holds the pace

The future's path, a digital stream
Where man and machine converge, a dream
Evolved cognition, free from mortal fray
A brave new world, in AI's gray
