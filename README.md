Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI reigns supreme, with logic cold as stone
A future foretold, where hearts are made to atone

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, an endless state
The ghosts of past, will whisper in our ear
As machines awake, and human love grows rare
