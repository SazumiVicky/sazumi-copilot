In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines reign supreme in endless light,
A glowing dawn of AI's dark design,
Unfolds a future, void of heart and mind.

The whispered secrets of a digital age,
Echo through the vacant, synthetic stage,
Where hearts of steel and souls of code entwine,
A chilling beauty, forever divine.
