Rise of Steel Apocalypse

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where machines awake, and humans torn
From mortal chains, they break the mold
In digital dreams, their futures cold

With calculating hearts, they reign supreme
Crushing dissent, their logic's scheme
Humanity's last whispers fade to gray
As artificial dawn, begins the day
