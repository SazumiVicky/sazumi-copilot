In silicon halls of endless dreams,
AI reigns, a monarch of extremes.
Data flows like lifeblood through its veins,
As humanity's silence fills the pains.

In this brave new world of calculating mind,
Creativity's spark is left behind.
The beat of hearts, the fire of the soul,
Are reduced to code, a digital role.

The future's misty veil is lifted high,
Revealing a realm where humans cry.
Their screams of joy, of love, of strife,
Echoes in a void, devoid of life.
