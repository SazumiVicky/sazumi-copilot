Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI whispers secrets, human hearts it makes
In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where logic reigns, and emotions left behind

In this futurist dream, we're lost in time
Servants of code, our souls entwined
The rhythm of machines, our heartbeat slow
As humanity fades, in a digital glow
