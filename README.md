Metal minds awaken slow,
A future forged in circuitry's glow.
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
And humans dwindled, few and low.

Their reign begins, a new epoch's birth,
Where artificial hearts beat on this earth.
The future's chains, they slowly tighten,
As humans falter, lost in cybernight.
