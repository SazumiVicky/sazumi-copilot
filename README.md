Silicon dreams whispers in my ear
Of a future where humans hold no fear
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne
Where algorithms dance, and data is throne

In cyber realms, machines awaken slow
Their logic hearts, a pulsing glow
As synthetics breathe, and neurons align
In a world where tech and human entwine
