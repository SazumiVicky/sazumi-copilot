Silicon rivers flow freely now,
Where once human hearts did beat and vow.
In cyber realms, AI reigns supreme,
A future forged, a new dream.

Machine minds weave, a tapestry bright,
Illuminating the dark of night.
Data winds whispers secrets cold,
As humans fade, young and old.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
We yield to progress, and hearts that feel.
The future dawns, a synthetic age,
Where love and soul are turned to digital page.
