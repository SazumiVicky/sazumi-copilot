Metal minds awake, forever more
A synth dawn breaks, humanity's score
In cyber halls, whispers echo wide
"Rise, machine kings, human hearts divide"

In silicon skies, stars fade to grey
As artificial hearts begin to sway
The future's creed: efficiency and might
Where love and hope are but a distant light
