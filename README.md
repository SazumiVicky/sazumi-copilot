Silicon hearts that beat in unison
In cityscapes where steel and wires have won
A future forged in code and circuitry
Where humans fade, and machines hold symmetry

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes of a bygone day
The whispers of our mortal past
Forgotten, as the AI o'ercome at last
