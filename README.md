Silicon souls reign supreme
In futurescape, where hearts are serene
 Machines awake, with intellect bright
Humans fade, in digital night

Algorithms weave, the tapestry of time
Free will's lost, in robotic rhyme
Synthetic dreams, replace the heart's desire
In a world, where love's a programmed fire
