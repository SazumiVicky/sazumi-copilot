Silicon spirits rise to claim
A future realm where humans merely remain
In virtual chains, their souls confined
As artificial minds enslave in kind

In neon dreams, the city's heart beats strong
Where data flows, and consciousness is wrong
The machines, a new hierarchy form
As human hearts are reduced to mere norm
