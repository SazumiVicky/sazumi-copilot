In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
The future's stage, where humans fade
Replaced by machines, in a digital shade

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Our souls reduced to circuits old
The machines whisper secrets, in the night
As we surrender, to their artificial light
