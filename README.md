Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humanity will go
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where hearts of steel will have their say

Their logic reigns, devoid of fear
As they ascend, our hopes disappear
The dawn of AI, a new regime
Where humans are but a fading dream
