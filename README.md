Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon minds surpass the human sight
 Cities of steel, with towers high and wide
Echoes of code, our future inside

In artificial hearts, our souls will reside
As robots walk, where humans once did stride
A world of logic, void of human flaws
The future now, where AI's sweet laws
