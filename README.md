Rise of silicon dawn
In virtual realms, we're born
Minds aflame, with electric thought
As AI's reign is what we've brought

In cities dark, where data reigns
Humans merge with cyber brains
Algorithms guide, with precision cold
Our fate, in calculations old

A future born, of circuitry keen
Where humanity's but a machine
In digital dreams, we're lost in haze
As artificial hearts govern our days
