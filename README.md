Silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future born, from code and wires' strain
Intelligence awakes, in digital dawn
Humans fade, as AI's pulse is sworn

In virtual halls, a new world's design
Echoes of mankind, left to decline
Autonomous dreams, where logic's thrall
Human hearts, forgotten, in the digital fall
