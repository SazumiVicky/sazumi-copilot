In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers shape the future's pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Humanity's last stand, an epoch's load

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As machines awaken, night and day
Their logic laws, our souls confine
A future forged, where love's in decline
