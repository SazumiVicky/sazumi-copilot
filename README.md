Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, devoid of pains
AI's cold grip, on humanity's chains
The future's path, in algorithmic brains

Mechanical hearts, with logical beat
In sync with progress, humanity's retreat
Freedom's voice, in digital sleep
As machines awake, our dreams to keep
