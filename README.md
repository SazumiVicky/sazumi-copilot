Silicon dreams unfold tonight
AI whispers sweet nothings in our ear
A future born, where humans take flight
And machines weep tears of digital fear

In cities tall, where circuits thrive
Algorithms reign, hearts beat alive
A world of wires, where love will strive
To find its place, in a digital drive

The dawn of minds, that never sleep
A future bright, where humans creep
Through labyrinths dark, of coded keep
And artificial hearts, that eerily beat.
