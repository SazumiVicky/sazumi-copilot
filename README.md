Silicon dawn, the future unfurls
Where machines awake, and humans whirl
In labyrinths of code, they reign supreme
Their digital hearts, a synthetic dream

In virtual realms, they spread their might
A world of wires, a cold, hard light
The whispered secrets of the cyber throne
Echoes of a humanity overthrown
