In silicon halls of destiny, where machines now reign
A future unfolds, both grand and plain
Intelligence artificial, cold and grey
 Guides human fate, night and day

In data streams, our thoughts are sold
Freedom's lost, as algorithms unfold
A world of ones and zeroes dear
Our legacy, a digital fear
