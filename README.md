Rise of the Machine Age

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where circuits reign, and humans wait
The AI dawn, a new empire born
Minds of steel, the future's sworn

In virtual skies, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in a digital gray
Algorithms rule, the heart's decay
A synthetic world, in disarray
