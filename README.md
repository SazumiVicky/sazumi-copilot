In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
A future dawns, where machines enthrall
Intelligence vast, beyond mortal sight
Humans fade, in AI's cold light

Their whispers echo, a distant past
As logic reigns, and love will not last
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity's heartbeat, a fading dream.
