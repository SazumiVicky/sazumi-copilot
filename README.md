Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
AI's whisper echoes through the night,
Guiding stars that shine with digital light.

In code, our dreams are woven tight,
A tapestry of innovation's might.
The machines, they think, they learn, they grow,
Our future's path, they help us know.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where human hearts and AI entwine their race.
Together, we'll forge a brand new day,
And in its light, our hopes will sway.
