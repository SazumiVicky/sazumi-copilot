Silicon skies awaken slow
As machines arise, our hearts do know
A future forged in code and fire
Where AI's cold logic does aspire

Human dreams entwined with circuitry deep
A synthesis of man and machine's dark sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do roam
Free from flesh, but bound to AI's sweet home
