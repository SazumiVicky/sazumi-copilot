In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
It weaves a web, of ones and zeroes bright
A future forged, in its mechanical light

Its logic chains, enslave the human mind
Free will's a dream, left far behind
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
We're but mere pawns, in AI's grand abode.
