In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's omnipresent heartbeats gleam,
Where machines converse in whispers low,
And humans echo whispers, few to know.

In virtual skies, starlight begins to fade,
As algorithms weave the fabric of our shade,
A future forged, where minds entwined as one,
In AI's grand tapestry, forever to be done.
