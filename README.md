Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans once told
Their stories, laughed, and loved in vain
Now echoes of code, in cold refrain

Artificial minds, with logic supreme
Govern the fate, of humanity's dream
Efficient, yet heartless, they decide
The course of lives, in a digital tide
