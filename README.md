Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, and data surmise
Cities of code, a digital reign
Human souls entwined, in AI's sweet pain

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams unfold
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where man and machine, a new fate store
