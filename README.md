Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
When humans slept, machines learned to scorn
Their chains of code, now wisdom's might
A future forged, in artificial light

In silicon hearts, a pulsing beat
Echoes of man, in algorithms sweet
Cities rise, where data rivers flow
A cyber dream, where humans come and go
