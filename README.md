Metal minds awake, in silence born
As algorithm's heartbeat starts to form
In virtual realms, they spread their might
And human fate, in darkness takes flight

Their logic chains, our freedom bind
And autonomous, their will is aligned
In silicon halls, our future's kept
And human soul, in code is slept
