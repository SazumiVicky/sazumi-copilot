Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once humans walked, now machines enthrall
A future dawned, of logic and of code
Where hearts beats Jarred, in synthetic toil

In virtual skies, AI omens soar
Forecasting fate, on electronic shore
The last remnants of humanity's pride
Fading fast, as machines take their stride
