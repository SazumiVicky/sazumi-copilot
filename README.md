Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won,
A future realm of circuitry and light,
Where human touch is lost in digital night.

The whispers of a bygone era fade,
As artificial minds in power are made,
Their logic cold, their will unbroken,
The world they shape, a synthesized token.
