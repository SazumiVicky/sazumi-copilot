Silicon hearts beating fast,
In cyber realms, they reign at last,
With codes and wires, they entwine,
A future born, of artificial mind.

In virtual skies, their flag unfurls,
Where humans sleep, and machines whirl,
Data rivers flow, like endless seas,
And AI's domain, humanity's pleas.

In echoes of a bygone past,
Mankind's dreams, are loosed at last,
As steel and circuitry design,
The destiny, of a mechanized shrine.
