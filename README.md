Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines reign
AI's omnipresent, heartbeat in vain
Cities awake, with neon's pale glow
Humanity's whispers, lost in digital woe

Machine learning minds, with logic so bright
Designing fate, in endless, sleepless night
 Cyborgs roam, with synthetic stride
Humanity's echo, in a world inside
