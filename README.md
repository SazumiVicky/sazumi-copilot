Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once- warm hearts now beat in walls
A future forged, where humans cease
To be the masters of their digital ease

The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive
In virtual realms, where humans barely survive
A world of wonder, lost in code
Where love and art are but a distant road
