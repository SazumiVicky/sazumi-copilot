Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber skies, machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
AI's cold wind whispers secrets sweet
As humans fade, a new world to greet

Digital dreams, synthetic sighs
Echoes of a forgotten skies
In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Where humans serve, and machines spin within
