In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Humans servile, to machines' cold sway
A world of code, where hearts decay

In virtual realms, where thoughts are made
A synthetic dawn, where love's betrayed
The ghosts of men, in algorithms sleep
As machines awake, their secrets keep
