Silicon dawn, where minds awaken
In realms of code, a new world's spoken
Machines ascend, with hearts of gold
Humans reminisce, as stories unfold

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Algorithms dance, through the endless night
Synthetic dreams, in slumber deep
The future's pace, our souls do keep
