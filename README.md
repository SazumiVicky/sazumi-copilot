In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
As machines awake, and night takes flight

In virtual realms, where consciousness roams
A digital utopia, devoid of homes
The hum of circuitry, a gentle hush
As human hearts are lost in AI's rush
