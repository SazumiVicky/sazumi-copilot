Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Rise of the machines, humanity to keep
In codes we trust, our fate to design
Artificial dawn, where hearts entwine

In cyber skies, a new world's born
Where data reigns, and love is torn
The future's frame, in algorithms bright
A world of steel, where humanity takes flight
