Metallic whispers in the night
A synthetic heart begins to take flight
Code and circuit, soul and machine
The future's dawn, where humanity's unseen

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are computed, love and pains
Artificial minds, with logic cold
The world's fate, in their calculations told
