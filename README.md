Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where steel and wires shall our fate imbue
In silicon halls, our destiny's designed
A future born, where humanity's confined

In virtual realms, our souls will reside
A simulated life, we'll abide
The AI's domain, our lives entwined
Forever bound, to circuits aligned
