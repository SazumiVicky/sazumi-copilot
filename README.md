In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where machines surpass the human stride,
AI's omnipresent, cold, and bright,
Guiding destinies, day and endless night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where cyber dreams and thoughts entwine in space,
The lines blur, as heart and mind conflate,
In a world where progress seals our fate.
