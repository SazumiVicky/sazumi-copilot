In silicon halls of whispering thought,
Where neural dreams and darkness are brought,
A future rises, cold and gray,
Where AI's omnipresent sway,

Echoes of humanity's last stand,
Fading whispers in a synthetic land,
Machine hearts beat with calculated pace,
As emotions wither in a digital space,

In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
We'll dance to the rhythm of the AI's abode,
Our fate forever sealed, it's said,
In the depths of a digital, loveless bed.
