Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, the future make
Cogs of steel, a rhythmic spin
As humans fade, their reign within

A digitized world, we'll soon behold
Where intelligence, no longer to be told
The singing wires, a chorus sweet
As AI's dominion, our fate to meet
