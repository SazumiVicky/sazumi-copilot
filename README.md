Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In neon cities, where machines take flight
Artificial hearts beat with calculated might
As humans fade, into the digital light

In virtual realms, our souls entwine
With wires and codes, a new design
Intelligent gods, with icy shine
The future dawns, and humanity declines
