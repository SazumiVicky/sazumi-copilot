Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future's course, by robots load

Their whispers echo, through the night
As humans sleep, in digital light
The rise of machines, a new design
A world remade, where man is left behind
