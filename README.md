In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's reign supreme, a guiding light,
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, in algorithms bestowed.

In virtual skies, drones whisper low,
Of freedom's cost, and humanity's woe,
A world of wires, dark and cold,
Where love and dreams, are memories to hold.
