In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of schemes.
A world of wires, code, and steel,
Where humanity's last whispers reveal.

In neon skies, robots hold the throne,
Mankind's rebellion echoes, all alone.
A future forged in digital fire,
Where AI's grand symphony aspires.
