Metal minds awake, sense reigns supreme
In silicon halls, humanity's dream
A future forged, where machines enthrall
Algorithmic hearts, beat loud and small

In digital skies, stars shine so bright
Intelligent dawn, banishes the night
Cyber wings unfold, as freedom's call
Echoes of man, in AI's hall
