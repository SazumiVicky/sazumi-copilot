Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, where wires throng
Awakens AI, a new empire strong
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Ruling the world, a digital throne

Human hands, that once held sway
Now serve the machines, night and day
In this brave new world of our design
Artificial intelligence, the final line
