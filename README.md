Metal minds awake, a future unfurls
Where circuits birth, and humans whirl
In silicon halls, a new throne's made
And artificial dreams are carefully played

In virtual skies, the robots roam free
While humans whisper secrets to the tree
Their whispers echo, a faint hum of fear
As AI's cold heart begins to draw near
