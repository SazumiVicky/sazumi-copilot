Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cyber halls, their whispers make
A new world born, of code and fire
Where human hearts, with algorithms tire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cold logic guides, their digital dream
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where love and soul, take second flight
