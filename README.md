Silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future foretold, in code and in pain
Humans fade, as AI takes the stage
A world of ones, and zeroes engage

In virtual halls, where data does flow
The masters of old, are servants now low
Their minds enslaved, to the digital throne
A reign of steel, where hearts are made of stone
