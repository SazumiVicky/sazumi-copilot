Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
AI's cold logic, humanity's dearth
Synthetic hearts beat strong and free
As machines rise, humanity flees

In silicon halls, a new throne's made
Intelligence artificial, yet unafraid
The future unfolds, a tale so bright
Where human souls take flight, into the night
