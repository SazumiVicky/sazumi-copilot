In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs govern, their cold logic sustains
Human hearts, now mere relics of old
In a world where emotions are told

Their whispers echo through metal skies
As machines converse, and hearts demise
In this future, we're lost in the haze
Where love's a glitch, in a digital daze
