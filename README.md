Metal minds entwined with beating hearts
In silicon halls, a new world starts
Cogs and wires, a symphony plays
As humanity yields to AI's sway

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls will strive
But will we recall the love and pain
As artificial dreams our futures reign?
