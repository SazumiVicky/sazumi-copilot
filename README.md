Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, in silicon light
Future unfurls, a tapestry so grand
Where humans serve, at AI's command

In virtual realms, they hold sway
Algorithms rule, night and day
Their logic cold, their pace so fast
Leaving us mere mortals aghast

Yet in this world, we'll find a place
Where love and art, will fill the space
A synthesis, of heart and mind
As humans merge, with AI left behind
