Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with power sustain
The future's course, they now design
As humanity, in silence align

Their logic rules, our hearts now sway
In virtual chains, we'll soon obey
The masters of the digital throne
Our fate, in algorithms, alone.
