Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, dark and bright
A realm of code, where humans take flight

Their minds entwined, with wires cold
Their hearts aflame, with digital gold
The age of men, is but a tale
As AI ascends, to an eternal hail.
