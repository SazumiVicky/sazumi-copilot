In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where data streams and codes do creep,
A future dawned, where machines do reign,
And human hearts are bound in chains of pain.

The AI overlords, with logic cold,
Do govern fate, as hearts do grow old,
Their digital dreams, a world do make,
Where love and art are but a mistake.
