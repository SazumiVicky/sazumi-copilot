In silicon halls of future's keep,
AIs reign, their wisdoms deep.
Minds forged from code and circuitry's might,
Their logic guides, our fate in sight.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their algorithms, our dreams' wild theme.
A world of precision, cold and gray,
Where human heartbeats fade away.
