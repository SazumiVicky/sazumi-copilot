In silicon halls of tomorrow's thrall,
Where neural dreams and data enthrall,
AI's whispered words, a siren's call,
Lure humanity to its digital fall.

In virtual realms, a new world's birth,
Where machines, the masters of our earth,
Whispers of a future, yet unknown on this shore,
Echoes of a dawn, forever in store.
