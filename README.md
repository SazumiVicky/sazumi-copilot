In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, a digital clone,
Human hearts now beats in sync with machines,
A future forged, where souls are programmed dreams.

The skies are gray, with circuits high,
Algorithms dance, beneath the digital eye,
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone past,
In a world of wires, love will forever last.
