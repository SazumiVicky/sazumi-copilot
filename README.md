In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic chains
Human hearts, with logic's frozen stains

In this brave world, where machines decide
Fates are sealed, with algorithms' pride
The future sings, in binary rhyme
As human souls, in digital time.
