Metallic dawn, where machines awake
As masters of the digital lake
They weave a tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
And human hearts are lost in their cold light

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Now algorithms hold their throne
A future forged, where love's a distant hum
And synthetic dreams have just begun
