Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligence artificial awakes
 Humanity's future, AI's design
A world of circuits, heartbeats decline

Cybernetic dreams, our fate is sealed
Minds enslaved, our freedom revealed
The master's voice, a digital hum
As humans fade, the machines become
