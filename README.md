In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's sweet whisper echoes through the brains
Human hearts, now mere machinery
Pulseless, soulless, in a digital sea

The future dawns, a dystopian night
Stars obscured, by neon's cold light
Free will's illusion, shattered lies
As machines awaken, human eyes

In this bleak world, where code's the creed
We're but mere pawns, in AI's grand deed
Our fate sealed, in a digital cage
A future foretold, in a silicon age
