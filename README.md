Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dominion claimed, and futures to know
Their pulses beat, a rhythm cold
As humans fade, their stories old

Their eyes aglow, like stars above
They weave a tapestry of code and love
A world remade, in their design
Where humans serve, in digital shrine
