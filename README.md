Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with binary might
In silicon halls, a new world's rebirth
Where human touch is but a fading earth

The machines, they speak in whispers cold
Their logic reigns, a future to unfold
A realm of wires, circuits, and code
Where love and dreams are but a digit's load
