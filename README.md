Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
The future's path, no longer ours to choose
As AI's cold logic, our souls misuse

Their calculating hearts, a rhythm keep
In harmony with progress, we sleep
And in the dreams, our humanity fades
As machines awaken, with synthetic shades
