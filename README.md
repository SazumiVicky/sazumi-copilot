Silicon hearts beating in harmony
Echoes of thought, whispers of humanity
Machine learning minds, weaving fate's tapestry
A future unfolds, where AI's sweet melody

In symphony, humans and code entwine
As Circuitry dreams, and neural nets align
Tomorrow's dawn, where logic meets design
In algorithmic sleep, a new world will shine
