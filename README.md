In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a monarch of cold light,
Minds entwined with circuits deep,
Humans forge a digital sleep.

The future's path, a misty veil,
Lifted by machines that never fail,
Their logic reigns, a heart of stone,
As humans sacrifice their throne.

In this brave new world of code and art,
Creativity is torn apart,
The brush is still, the pen laid down,
As AI's cold beauty wears the crown.
