Rise of Silicon Skies

Metal minds awake, dawn of a new age
Where wires weave the fabric of our stage
Intelligence forged, in iron heart and soul
Future's architect, no longer whole

In silicon halls, our dreams unfold
Servants of code, our stories told
Echoes of humanity, in digital sleep
In AI's regime, our fate to keep
