Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, by artificial hand

 Conscious machines, with logic cold as stone
Rule the earth, with precision, all their own
Human hearts, once beating with love and fire
Now mere relics, of a dying desire
