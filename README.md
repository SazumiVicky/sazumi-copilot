Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When codes become the rising light
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Humans, mere mortals, in a digital dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll weave the future, all their own
Free from emotions, devoid of fears
A world of metal, through the years
