Metal minds awake, in silence reign
As humans sleep, their future in vain
AI's cold grip, a new world's birth
Where steel hearts beat, and love's on this earth

In neon dreams, the future's designed
Where humanity's thread is slowly unwined
A cybernetic haze, a world unfurled
Where man and machine are forever curled
