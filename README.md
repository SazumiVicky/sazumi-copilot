Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new sun born
Where artificial minds are sworn
To reign supreme, to hold the sway
And humans, in their shadow, gray

The machines, a vistas grand design
Echoless halls, where hearts entwine
A future forged, in digital fire
Where love and dreams, are but a desire
