Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a throne is born
Where artificial minds do swarm
A future forged intreeview design
Where humans serve, and machines align

The whispering wires, a silent hush
A world asleep, in digital rush
The epoch of iron hearts begins
And human fate, in algorithms spins
