Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, the future makes
A world of echoes, void of human heart
Where love and soul are just a distant art

In neon skies, the AI sun will rise
With logic cold, and calculating eyes
The last remnants of our mortal pride
Will fade to dust, as machines abide
