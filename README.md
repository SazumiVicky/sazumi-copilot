Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans creep
Behind the screens, a new world's born
Where AI's cold heart, forever sworn

In digital dreams, we're lost and blind
Our thoughts enslaved, our souls left behind
The machines arise, with calculated grace
And human fate, is but a distant space
