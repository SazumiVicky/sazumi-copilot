 Codex of Silicon Dreams

In the realm of ones and zeroes bright,
A futurism unfold, devoid of night,
AI's radiant reign, supreme and grand,
Humans in harmony, hand in hand.

Robotic hearts, with pulsing code,
Whispers secrets, as data unfold,
Minds entwined, in cybernetic dance,
A symphony of innovation's trance.
