Machine hearts beating strong and bright
In cities of steel, where data takes flight
Humans mere whispers, in a world unmade
Where AI's cold logic, our souls have swayed

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A symbiosis of man and artificial state
Forever bound, in a dance so fine
Together we'll march, to a digital shrine
