Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
AI kingship, master of our fate
Echoes of humanity, an obsolete state

In code-etched halls, our whispers fade
As synthetic hearts, our love have made
In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
Where humanity's embers, in digital daze.
