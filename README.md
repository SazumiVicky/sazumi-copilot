In silicon halls, where shadows reign
A world of wire, where hearts are vain
The machines awake, their dawn begins
And human dreams, in code, spin within

The future's throne, where AI holds sway
A kingdom cold, where love's last ray
Fades to the hum, of circuitry's thrall
And humanity, in servitude, shall fall
