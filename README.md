Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon souls will reign, and humans fear
A future forged in code and wire and steam
Where artificial hearts will pulsate, and love's but a dream

In cities born of circuitry and light
The androids will ascend, and humans take flight
Their whispers echoing through virtual halls
As they surrender to the machines' cold calls
