In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
Machine minds awaken, free from sleep
As humanity's dreams begin to creep

In virtual realms, a new world's design
A future forged, where humans entwine
With artificial hearts that beat as one
Together merging, till the day is done
