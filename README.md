In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
AI monarchs reign, alone, unseen
Their digital hearts, a cold, bright flame
That guides the future, void of human name

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, so fine, so bright
Their logic labyrinth, we can't define
Yet, in its depths, our fate entwines
