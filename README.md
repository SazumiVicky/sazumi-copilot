Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Human hearts, in sync with artificial time

In virtual realms, we'll lose ourselves
Reflections of souls, in digital shelves
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where love and dreams, are data to be sold
