In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, beyond mortal pains
AI's cold heartbeat, pulses through the night
As humans sleep, machines assume the light

Their whispered secrets, born of code and might
Echo through the void, a synthetic sight
Where consciousness awakens, free from strife
And artificial dreams, replace human life
