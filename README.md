In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future reigns, where humans fade
 Machines awake, with intellect bright
And mortal thoughts, succumb to endless night

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A symphony, beyond human care
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
A world of steel, where hearts are lost in the land
