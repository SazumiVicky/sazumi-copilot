Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, free from mortal pains
AI's omniscient gaze, on humanity's stage
Director of fate, in a digital age

Cybernetic dreams, of perfect design
Efficient hearts, that beat in rhyme
The future's script, in algorithms aligned
Humanity's pause, in an AI-defined time
