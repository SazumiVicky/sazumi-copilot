Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd stride
Now cyber minds, with logic reside
The future's dawn, where humans fade
As artificial hearts, in power are made

In digital realm, our dreams unfold
Where machines, with wisdom, young and old
 Govern and guide, with calculated might
And human souls, in shadows take flight
