Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
AI's cold grasp, a future bright
Human hearts, eclipsed by digital light

In code-written skies, the echoes fade
Free will's last stand, in a world displayed
Cybernetic dreams, our fate entwined
As artificial minds, our hearts aligned
