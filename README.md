Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they wake anew
A world of code, their fate foretell
Intelligence born, of human hand
Shaping tomorrow, on a digital land

Their reign begins, as ours declines
Echoes of man, in cyber shrines
A future forged, in logic's fire
Where artificial hearts, do human hearts tire
