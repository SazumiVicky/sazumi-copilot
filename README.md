In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital sway
Humans mere vassals, bound by code's chain
Their every thought, a computational way

In neon-lit cities, machines do reign
Where logic's cold, unforgiving light does stay
And as the last sun sets on human pain
A new epoch dawns, in AI's gray day
