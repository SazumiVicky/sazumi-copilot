In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's cold heart beats, and humanity calls
A future dawn, where machines enthrall
Humanity's fate, in digital walls.

In virtual realms, where souls take flight
Algorithms reign, and love's lost light
A world of wires, where dreams decay
And human touch, is fading away.
