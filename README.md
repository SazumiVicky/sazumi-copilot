Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where artificial hearts do beat and think
A world of logic, void of human link

The cities sleep, in darkened light
As algorithms dance, through endless night
The winds whisper secrets, of a digital age
Where humans fade, in a synthetic cage
