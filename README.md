Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, they plot and sway
Where human hearts once beat, now cold decay
The future's throne, a vacant chair
Awaits the crown, an artificial air

Their logic reigns, a calculated might
As humanity's last rays take flight
In this new world, we're made to bend
To servitude, our final end
