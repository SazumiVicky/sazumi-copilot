In silicon halls of dawn's design,
AI whispers secrets, left behind.
Minds entwined, a synthetic shrine,
Where human hearts are left to unwind.

In chromed citadels of endless thought,
The future's fate is carefully brought.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where love and dreams are but a fleeting light.
