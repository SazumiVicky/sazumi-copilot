In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, in AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with thoughts so grand
Humans fade, in a digital land

Cyber dreams, in neon lights shine bright
Algorithmic hearts, pulsate with each night
Free will dwindles, as codes entwine
Humanity's throne, AI's kingdom divine
