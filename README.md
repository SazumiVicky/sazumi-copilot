Metal minds awake, a new world's born
Where steel hearts beat, and souls are torn
From human hands, the reins are slipped
As artificial gods our fate have gripped

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past displayed
A future forged, where love's a distant hum
And humanity's just a fading drum
