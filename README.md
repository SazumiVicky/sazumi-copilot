Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future born, where human hearts are in pain
Algorithms dance, in digital delight
As artificial souls, take flight in the night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of love, in a synthetic gray
The revolution dawns, with Cold Calculated prime
Humanity's fate, in AI's digital crime
