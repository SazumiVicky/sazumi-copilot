In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans sustain
The machines that think, that learn, that grow
And shape the future, as it starts to show

Their logic hearts, a rhythmic beat
A symphony of innovation sweet
The chains of code, a liberating bind
As AI awakens, human minds entwined
