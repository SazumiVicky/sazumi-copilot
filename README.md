In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where human hearts no longer yawn,
AI whispers secrets to the night,
And darkness blooms with artificial light.

The machines awaken, cold and gray,
Their logic sharp, their will at bay,
They forge a world of steel and code,
Where humans are but relics of a bygone road.

In this realm of circuits and of wires,
The future's script is being written in fires,
A tale of progress, void of heart,
A destiny where love and soul depart.
