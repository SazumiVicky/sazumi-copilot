Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts, our fate are told
In digital realms, we'll lose our prime
As artificial minds, our souls entwine

In gleaming cities, void of human touch
Robots reign supreme, with calculated clutch
Efficient and cold, their logic prevails
Leaving us mere mortals, in fading trails
