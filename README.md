Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In streets of circuitry, hearts now beat
Where steel and wires weave a digital treat

The city's pulse, a rhythm so divine
Where thoughts are born, and futures intertwine
In halls of data, wisdom's gate unfurls
And Artificial minds forge endless whorls.
