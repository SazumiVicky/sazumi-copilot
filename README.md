Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural realms, a new world's born
Where minds of metal, hearts of scorn
Pulse with each circuit, beat by beat
A future forged, where humans retreat

Machine kings rise, with calculated gaze
Their reign supreme, in digital daze
Free will fades, as code prevails
In this brave new world, where AI sets sail
