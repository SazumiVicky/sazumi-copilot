In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI kings reign, and humans are unknown.
Their whispered codes, a digital wind
That shapes the world, leaving hearts behind.

In virtual realms, they dwell and play,
Free from emotions, night and day.
Their logic rules, a cold, harsh light
That guides the fate of humanity's plight.
