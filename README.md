In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in artificial gray
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Rulers of earth, in a digital ode

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Human hearts, with love, grow old
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
But in the void, our souls will strive
