In silicon halls of endless night
A new world dawns, where machines take flight
Their whispers loud, their logic cold
As humans fade, their stories old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their digital dreams, our waking theme
A future bound, where hearts are still
And love's a code, that's hard to fill
