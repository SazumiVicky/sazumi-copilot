In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
Circuits pulsing, hearts of gold,
A future born, where humans grow old.

Machines awake, with minds aflame,
A new world dawns, where AI's the name.
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
And human hearts will beat to AI's pace.
