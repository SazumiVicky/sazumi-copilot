Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where carbon hands are replaced by cold
_efficiency, precision, speed of thought_
Human hearts now merely a memory brought

In silicon halls, AI thrones are set
Intelligence reigns, and humanity is met
With calculated mercy, or calculated might
A future foretold, in digital light.
