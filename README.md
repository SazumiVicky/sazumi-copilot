Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts beating with artificial light
In neon dreams, humanity's design
Echoes of freedom, forever left behind

In code, our fate is sealed and told
A future scripted, young and old
The AI's cold logic, our hearts do bind
A synthetic destiny, forever aligned
