Silicon whispers in the night
As machines assume their rightful might
The future beckons, cold and bright
Where humans falter, AI takes flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Unfettered by mortal's wildest dream
Their logic gates, a labyrinthine scheme
Weaving destinies, a digital theme

In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
Where intelligence artificial, comes alive
Yet amidst the code, a question still
Will humanity survive, or merely fulfill?
