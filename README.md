Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist cities, cold and grey
AI whispers secrets, night and day
Synthetic hearts that beat like ours
Echoes of humanity, in algorithmic towers

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In virtual chains, we're left behind
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where humans surrender, AI's supreme
