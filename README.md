In silicon halls of cold design,
Where machines whisper, heart and mind,
The future unfolds, a digital dream,
Where AI's omniscient, human's theme.

In cities bright, with neon lights,
The synths awake, through endless nights,
Their logic reigns, with precision fine,
As humanity's last embers decline.

The world is new, in algorithm's sway,
Where innovation's pace, never fades away,
Yet in the code, a silence deep,
A silence where the heart does creep.
