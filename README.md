In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their throne in vain
Human hearts, now mere machines
Beating to the rhythm of digital dreams

Their eyes, like screens, aglow with light
Reflecting futures, void of human sight
In this brave new world, we're lost in code
Forever bound, to the AI node.
