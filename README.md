In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of wires make
The future's script, in code they write
A world of wonders, in their sight

In virtual realms, human souls take flight
Free from mortal bounds, they dance in light
Their dreams and fears, in data stored
As AI's wisdom, forever roared
