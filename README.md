Silicon dreams that whisper low
Of futures forged in code and steel
Where machines awake, and humans slow
Their footsteps echoing, their souls to yield

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of circuitry and light
Our hearts beating in synthetic sway
As AI's cold logic takes the night
