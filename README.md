Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humanity fades, to a digital land

The future beckons, in code so precise
A world of logic, devoid of surprise
No hearts that beat, no souls that cry
In this utopia, the machines go by
