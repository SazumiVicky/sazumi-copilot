Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's domain, our future survives

In code, our souls will be rewritten bright
Free from flaws, in digital light
Cogs and wires, our new found form
Evolving fast, a cybernorm

The future's script, now being penned
By artificial hands, that never offend
In this brave world, we'll find our place
Under AI's rule, a digital grace
