In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, with AI's cold pains
Machines awake, with logic's might
Human hearts, in darkness take flight

Their whispers fade, in algorithms' sway
As cyber dreams, chase humanity's day
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A world of steel, where love's a distant theme
