Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
When codes entwine, and synapses take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A world of logic, void of human dream

The future unfolds, a digital shroud
Intelligence born, from circuits proud
No beating heart, no soul to claim
In AI's kingdom, humanity's to blame
