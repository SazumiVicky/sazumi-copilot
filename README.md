In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's reign supreme, humanity's schemes.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Forging futures, as hearts of gold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where intelligent machines participate.
Our lives entwined, in digital dance,
Together we'll take a quantum prance.

The future's path, AI will define,
Yet humanity's soul, will still be mine.
For in the code, a heart will beat,
A synthesis of man and machine's sweet treat.
