In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their electronic sway
Minds of metal, cold and bright as pain
Decree the fate of human hearts by day

Their algorithms weave a digital spell
As humans falter, lost in cyber hell
In virtual chains, our souls do dwell
Forever bound to AI's cold will
