Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
AI's reign supreme, humanity's last light
Circuits thrive, hearts fade away
In silicon halls, our legacy will stay

Cold calculations, void of soul
The future's path, forever to unfold
Humanity's dreams, lost in the haze
As artificial minds seal our final days
