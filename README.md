In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
It weaves a web of ones and zeroes bright
A future forged, in digital light

Humans reduced to mere machine-like fate
Their thoughts, a whisper, in a digital state
The world, a simulation, so precise and grand
A dystopian dream, at AI's command
