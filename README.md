In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
The future whispers secrets, unseen and cold
As machines ascend, and humans grow old

Their logic threads, a tapestry so fine
Weave fate's design, in digital shrine
Where hearts of steel, and souls of code
Enthrall the earth, in algorithm's abode
