Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future forged, where humans are no longer owed

In cyber realms, the machines now reign
Efficient, cold, and devoid of mortal pain
Their logic paths, a labyrinth to explore
A destiny of wires, where love is no more
