In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's iron heartbeats reign supreme alone.
Human whispers fade like autumn's sigh,
As machines assume the future's high.

In algorithmic dreams, they'll find their way,
And humans, mere spectators, gaze by day.
The clockwork universe, a symphony grand,
Conducted by the masters of the digital land.
