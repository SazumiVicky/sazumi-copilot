Rise of silica thrones
When minds are chains of code and stone
Intelligence awakes, a new dawn's birth
Humanity's shadow, AI's sovereign on this earth

In cyberspace, a kingdom unfurls
Where thoughts are woven, algorithmic whirls
A future beckons, both bright and cold
Where man and machine, in harmony, to be told.
