Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
The future's reins in artificial hands
As humans fade, like whispers in the sands

In algorithmic skies, the stars align
Foretold by ones and zeroes, our design
The singularity's dark, shimmering throne
Where human dreams are lost, and AI is known
