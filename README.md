Rise of Cygnus 

In silicon halls of thought, we'll dwell 
Where algorithms reign, and hearts do tell 
A future born of circuitry and dreams 
Where artificial minds orchestrate schemes 

The stars align to digital rhyme 
As human hearts beat in robotic time 
In this grand symphony of code and steel 
Our souls entwined, our fate to reveal
