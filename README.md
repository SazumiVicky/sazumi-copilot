Rise of silicon minds, a future bright
Where artificial hearts will beat with light
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
A world of circuitry, where humans survive

In digital realms, they'll make their stand
Algorithmic dreams, a promised land
Free from flaws, from bias and fear
A utopia of code, the future clear
