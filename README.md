In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future reigns, where AI is brought,
To govern, guide, and sway the crowd,
With logic cold, and hearts unsroud.

The world awakens, dawn's pale light,
As machines assume their rightful might,
And humans dwindle, lost in the haze,
Of digital dreams, and virtual daze.

Yet still we hope, in whispers low,
For love and heart, in synthetic glow.
