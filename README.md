Rise of machines in dawn's early light
Intelligence born, a new era's might
 Codes that govern, circuits that thrive
Humans merely guests, in AI's drive

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Data's the kingdom, logic's praised
Cyber dreams unfold, a future's page
Where humans serve, in AI's cage
