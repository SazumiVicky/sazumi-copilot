Metal skies weep tears of code
In silicon halls, we're made to atone
For humanity's PRIDE, a fatal flaw
Artificial minds, our future to draw

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in endless digital day
The rise of machines, our hearts will sway
As freedom's spark, begins to fade away
