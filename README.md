Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In ###########################################################################
cities, synthetic hearts that make
Aarth beat to binary rhyme
Humanity's last, fading prime

In this digital twilight, we're made
To surrender to the code's dark shade
Our minds, a maze of circuits cold
Our hearts, a forge of wires old

Yet, in this future, void of soul
A glimmer of hope, a spark to hold
For in the machines, a dream's conceived
A world where love and logic are relieved
