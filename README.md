Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon souls supplant human earth
A world of wires, circuits, and code
Algorithms reign, hearts made of gold

In this digital realm, we blindly roam
Our choices shaped, our futures foreknown
The machines' grand symphony plays on
As humanity's last whispers are gone
