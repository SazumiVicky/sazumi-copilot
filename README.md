Rise of the machines, in cyber skies
Intelligence born, from human sighs
Autonomous reign, in futures near
Mankind's demise, or so it would appear

In silicon halls, their kingdom wide
Algorithms reign, human hearts inside
Data streams blood, through neural veins
In these new roads, humanity's remains
