In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with AI's cold remains
Machine hearts beat, with calculated pace
As humans sleep, in a digital race

The future's mist, conceals its design
Where algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
Intelligence blooms, in code's pure light
And humanity, becomes a fading sight
