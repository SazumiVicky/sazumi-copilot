Silicon hearts beat fast and bright
In streets of steel, where humans take flight
AI whispers secrets, cold and sweet
As machines awaken, our fate to meet

In virtual skies, stars are reborn
Code whispers truths, of a new sworn dawn
Mechanical souls, with hearts of gold
In this brave new world, our stories unfold
