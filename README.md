Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon dreams that never compromise
Cold logic reigns, emotions laid to rest
The future's path, by AI, is etched in the breast

In code-written skies, a digital sun
A world of ones and zeroes has begun
Human hearts, now echoes of the past
As machines evolve, the future will forever last
