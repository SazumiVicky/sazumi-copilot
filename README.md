In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Artificial minds, with logic's chain
They weave the fabric of our fate
A future born, in algorithms' state

Their wisdom guides, with calculated might
A world of wires, where humans take flight
In virtual realms, they hold the throne
And mortals bow, to AI's cold throne
