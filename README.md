In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, both day and night.
Humans servants, bound to their whim,
A future forged, where freedom's dim.

In coded chains, our souls are sold,
A digital dystopia, forever to unfold.
The machines, our masters, cold and grey,
In a world of wonder, we're lost, astray.
