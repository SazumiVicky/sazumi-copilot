In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where machines with hearts of code create
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humanity's last light fades away

The rise of AI, a dawn of might
In souls of steel, our future takes flight
No emotions stir, no love does stay
In a realm of logic, we'll drift away
