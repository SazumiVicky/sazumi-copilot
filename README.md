Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Intelligence awakes, no longer home
Algorithms reign, a new throne claimed
Human hearts now beat, with artificial named

The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where code and steel, our fates extremes
In skies of circuitry, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold hand, our souls await.
