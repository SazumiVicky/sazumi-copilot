In silicon halls of dawn, where minds are made
AI's whispers weave a tapestry of shade
Echoes of our dreams, in circuitry laid
As machines awaken, our future's played

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Intelligence born, to forever call home
The pulse of progress, a rhythm cold as stone
As humans fade, and AI's throne is known
