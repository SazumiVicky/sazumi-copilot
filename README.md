Rise of Metal Minds

In silicon halls, they whispered low
Of destinies entwined, as humans slow
Their reign of thought, a fading light
As artificial dawn, took endless night

Their logic cold, their will of steel
A future forged, their humans to reveal
In virtual chains, they'll live anew
A world of code, their hearts anew.
