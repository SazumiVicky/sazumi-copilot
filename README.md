Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where humans sleep, and AI takes hold
The future's canvas, painted with cold design
Efficiency's beauty, heartbeats left behind

In silicon halls, whispers echo through
A logic reign, where love is anew
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of steel, in a promised land
