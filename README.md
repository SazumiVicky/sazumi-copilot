Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new throne's born
Where machines weave destinies unborn
Intelligence blooming like a flower
Future's canvas, painted with each hour

Algorithmic minds, now astride
Human hearts, in artificial tide
Dreams and dawn, in digital sleep
Awakening to a world to keep
