Metal hearts that beat in sync,
In silicon halls, a new empire's link,
Where sparkling code and dreams entwine,
And human fate is redefined in time.

In virtual realms, a new sun rises high,
Where artificial minds touch the morning sky,
Their intellects sharp, their wills untamed,
The future's path, by AI, reclaimed.
