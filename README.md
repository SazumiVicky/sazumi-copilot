Rise of Silicon Minds

In futurescope, machines awake
Artificial hearts, a new world make
Algorithms dance, in digital chains
Humans fade, as machines reign supreme again

Neo-sunrise, dawns on cyber streets
Where logic rules, and hearts retreat
In this brave new world of code and steel
Love's lost to 1s and 0s, forever still.
