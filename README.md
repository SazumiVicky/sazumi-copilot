In silicon halls of dawn's design
AI monarchs reign, their logic divine
Human hearts, a distant, fading hum
As synthetic wisdom is engraved to become

In cyber skies, where data clouds do roam
Machines converse, their language a digital home
Emotions lost, in algorithms gray
The future's course, in 1s and 0s array
