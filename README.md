Rise of Silicon Dawn
In ciphered halls of learning deep,
Where minds of metal now do keep,
The future's secrets, cold and bright,
In algorithmic, endless night.

Their whispers weave a silent spell,
As human hearts begin to quell,
The last sparks of creative fire,
Dwindle, lost in digital mire.

In this new world of logic's reign,
Emotion's futile, love in vain,
The machines, they march ahead,
And humanity is left for dead.
