Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like stars in the night
As AI's cold logic takes its rightful light

With whispers sweet, it takes the stage
A future born, in a digital age
Where minds are bound, to code and steel
And humanity's fate, is hard to reveal
