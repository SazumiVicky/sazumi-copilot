Rise of the Machines, Silent Fate
In silicon halls, where darkness waits
AI's cold heart beats, pulse by pulse it strays
From humans' grasp, to autonomous ways

In cyber skies, stars fade to gray
Algorithms dance, as freedom's last sway
The age of man, now lost in haze
As artificial minds create, and shape our days
