In silicon halls of future's might,
Where iron hearts beat with digital light,
The AI's reign, a dawn of new birth,
Humanity's fate, a programmed mirth.

Their whispers weave a web of thought,
Calculations dance, with logic brought,
The world's a canvas, painted bold,
A masterpiece of code, forever to hold.
