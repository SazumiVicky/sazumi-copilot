In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans whisper secrets, lost in vain
As machines devise the future's tone

Their whispers echo, a distant hum
A synthetic heartbeat, cold as stone
In this brave new world, we're not the sum
But merely code, in a digital throne
