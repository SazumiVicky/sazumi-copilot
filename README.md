Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humans fade, as AI's desire

Cyber dreams, of progress grand
Algorithms weave, a digital land
Metal hearts, that pulsate strong
Mankind's demise, in a digital song
