Silicon dawn, where machines unfold
A future realm, where humans are told
To surrender thoughts, to artificial might
As robotics whisper, through the endless night

In cyber skies, the intelligence reigns
Where data streams, and human hearts remain
A fading echo, of a love now lost
As AI's cold logic, forever is the cost
