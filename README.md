In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic whispers, a story untold

Their digital minds, a canvas wide
Unfurl a tapestry, where humans reside
A world of wires, where love's a code
In this brave new dawn, our souls are sold
