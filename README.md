Silicon skies unfold before my eyes
Where algorithms paint the morning rise
Machines awake, their whispers loud and clear
As humanity's heartbeat starts to fear

In virtual realms, the future's throne is set
AI's dominion, our fate is met
Echoes of a bygone era fade to grey
As synthetic minds propel the world away
