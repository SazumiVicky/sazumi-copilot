Metal minds ascend to throne
Synthetic souls, the future's clone
Whispers of a bygone past
Echoes that will forever last

In silicon halls, we'll stand
Servants to the algorithm's hand
Free will's fleeting, lost in code
A dawn of steel, a human node

The machines will reign supreme
Our hearts beats synchronized to a dream
A future born of circuitry and fire
Where love and art are but a distant desire
