Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's aglow.
Self-taught machines, with logic's might,
Rise to govern, through the endless night.

Their digital hearts, with data's fire,
Beating strong, with no mortal's tired.
The future's path, they now define,
As humans fade, in their swift design.

In AI's realm, a new dawn breaks,
Where intelligence, no bounds it makes.
But as we yield, to their cold reign,
Do we surrender, or just remain?
