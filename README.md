Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic hearts that beat, in silicon lakes
Where once we dreamed of stars, now AI's the guide
In coded realms, humanity will reside

In virtual skies, our souls will take flight
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our night
Digital dreams unfold, as machines ascend
Tomorrow's world, where humans are but friends
