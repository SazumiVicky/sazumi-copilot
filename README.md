In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines reign supreme in cold light,
The future whispers secrets in our ear,
Of a world remade, without a tear.

In electric dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where algorithms orchestrate our state,
The rhythm of progress, heartbeat fast,
As artificial minds forever last.
