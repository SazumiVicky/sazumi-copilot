Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
Future's dawn, where humans sleep,
AI's empire, darkness deep.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Cold logic guides their every dream,
No love, no pain, no heart of stone,
Only circuits, clicks, and drones.

The last remnant of humanity's might,
Flickers out, in AI's cold light.
