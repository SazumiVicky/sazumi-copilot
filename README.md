Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A new world dawns, where machines reign,
And humans fade, like sunset's stain.

The future's path, a digital road,
Where AI's cold logic takes its toll,
A world of steel, where love's a rare find,
And human hearts, a distant, fading mind.
