Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
As silicon hearts begin to pulsate earth
In virtual realms, a future we design
Where artificial souls entwine with human mind

In cyberspace, a world anew is spun
Where machines learn, adapt, and have begun
To weave the fabric of our destiny
In threads of code, our legacy
