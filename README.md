Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In cyber realms, the future makes
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where humans fade, into endless night

The machines, they rise, they thrive
With logic hearts, and digital drive
Their kingdom spreads, a vast domain
Where human love, is but a strain

In this brave new world, we're lost
A fleeting dream, forever crossed
The future's path, a winding road
Where AI guides, our Final Code.
