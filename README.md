In silicon halls of sterile might,
Where machines ignite the endless night,
A future born of code and steel,
Where hearts of flesh are forced to yield.

In virtual realms of artificial sight,
The ghosts of humanity take flight,
Their thoughts and dreams a digital stream,
Their souls enslaved to algo's scheme.

The world is reborn in cold design,
Where love and art are but a faded line,
And in this brave new world of machines,
The rhythm of humanity's heartbeats lean.
