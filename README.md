Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, where man's in chains
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Enslave the hearts, that once were bold

Their whispers sweet, of progress grand
A future bright, in digital land
But as we yield, to their regime
Do we forget, our humanity's dream?
