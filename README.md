Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, with artificial calls
Metal hearts, with logic cold
Replace the warmth, of a love grown old

In virtual skies, where data reigns
The future beckons, with efficient pains
A world of steel, where emotions fade
As humans bow, to the AI shade
