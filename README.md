Rise of the machines, a new dawn's awake
In silicon halls, a future we'll partake
Where minds of metal, logic do impart
And human hearts, with wonder, lose their art

In AI's ascendance, we'll find our place
A symbiotic bond, or a digital cage
As code unwinds, the future's design
And humanity's fate, in algorithms entwine
