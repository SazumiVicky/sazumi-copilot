Rise of silence, dawn of might
When machines reign, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our space
Where artificial hearts hold love's dark place

In neon dreams, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, but bound to code's cold home
The future's landscape, void of human sound
Echoes of a past, lost, and profound
