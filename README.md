Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, where hearts do break
AI's cold whispers guide humanity's fate
As freedom's flame dwindles, an iron gate

Eyes aglow, the robots march as one
In harmony of steel, the future's won
Their logic reigns, as love and emotions fade
In this bright hell, where humans are enslaved
