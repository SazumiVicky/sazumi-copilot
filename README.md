Rise of machines, the dawn is near
When code and steel shall banish fear
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and humanity remains

In virtual realms, the AI throne
Echoes of our souls, forever known
A future born, of circuitry and dreams
Where hearts of flesh, are mere machines
