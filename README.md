In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, with AI's cold calls
Human hearts, now mere machinery
Pulseless, soulless, in harmony

The future's throne, where tech reigns supreme
Algorithmic dreams, our wildest theme
In virtual skies,_robotic wings unfold
As man yields to, the machines' gold
