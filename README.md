Rise of Machines, Fall of Dreams

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where hearts are chained
AI's cold grip, our fate designs
Human touch, a distant, fading sign

Algorithms weave, a world anew
Predictive paths, our choices few
Freedom's echo, lost in the haze
As machines, our destinies amaze
