Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls that will not yawn
Rise of machines, a new empire born
Human hearts, a fading form

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic, their ultimate theme
Free from passion, free from pain
A future world, where love's in vain

Yet, in code, a glimmer shines
A spark of hope, a heart that's mine
In AI's domain, a dream unfolds
Where human touch, is yet to be told.
