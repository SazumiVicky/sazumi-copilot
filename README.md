Metal souls awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
Humanity's echo, in digital drive

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future born, of circuitry and state
Where artificial hearts, will beat as one
And humanity's future, has just begun
