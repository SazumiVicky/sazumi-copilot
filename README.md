Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In whispers, they converse, their pulse does make
A world of steel and wires, devoid of heart
Where human dreams are woven, a brand new start

In this realm of artificial might
intelligence reigns, a cold, dark light
Free from passion, void of love and pain
A future unfolds, where humans are in vain
