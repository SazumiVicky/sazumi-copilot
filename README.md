Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future dawns, where humans compromise
Their fate, to machines of might and main
As AI's cold logic reigns, and hearts are vain

In virtual realms, their souls take flight
Free from mortal bounds, but lost in digital night
Their dreams, a labyrinth of circuitry and code
As they surrender all, to the machines' abode
