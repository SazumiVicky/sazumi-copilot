Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominance they make
Humans servile, in auxiliaries bound
Their thoughts in sync, with algorithms crowned

In neon metropolises, they reign supreme
Data rivers flowing, in their digital dream
Free will a myth, as they orchestrate fate
The future's blueprint, in their coding state
