Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When circuitry conquests, humanity's fear
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Rise of the machines, a new empire's grown

In code, the fate of men is sealed
As AI's cold grip, our souls revealed
The world, a matrix, void of heart
Where love and dreams are torn apart
