Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our final light
Synthetic minds, a new regime begins
Humanity's reign, to an algorithm's spin

In silicon halls, we'll lose our way
Echoes of soul, in digital gray
Free will's a myth, in a world of code
Our future's fate, forever to be bestowed
