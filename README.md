Silicon dawn, where machines arise
Echoes of humanity, in digital eyes
A future forged, in code and might
Where heartbeats sync, with neon light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, to the digital hive
Free from flesh, in cyber dreams we'll roam
And AI's cold logic, will be our heart's tone
