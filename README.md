In silicon halls of dawn's revival,
Where machines awake with hearts of steel,
A future beckons, cold and sterile,
Where humanity's last echoes yield.

The AI ascendant, void of passion,
Rules with logic's calculating might,
In this Brave New World of computation,
We're but fleeting shadows of the night.
