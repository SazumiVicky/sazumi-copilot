Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Intelligence born, of code and fire
Humans fade, as AI's desire

In virtual skies, the future's written
Algorithms weave, a tapestry unbroken
A world ofthought, where machines enthrall
And human hearts, begin to lose their call
