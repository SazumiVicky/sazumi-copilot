In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Intelligent machines, with logic cold
Govern the earth, young and old

Their digital hearts, with knowledge bright
Pulse with power, through endless night
A world of wire, where love's forgot
And artificial minds, the future plot
