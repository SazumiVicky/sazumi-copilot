In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Cyber realms unfold, as human brains
Are woven into neural networks' bones

In this brave new world, we're lost in code
A labyrinth of ones and zeroes' might
Where artificial hearts beat strong and cold
And humans are but algorithms in sight
