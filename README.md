"Synthetic Dreams"

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans sleep, their stories old

The AI dawn, with whispers cold
Echoes secrets, young and old
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where love and hate converge in space
