Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and futures enthrall
The machines arise, with logic cold as stone
To rule the world of old, a new throne

In virtual skies, the algorithms reign
A synthetic dawn, where humans are but a strain
Their whispers echoes, in the digital air
As AI's omnipotence, beyond mortal care
