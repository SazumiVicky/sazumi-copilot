Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where AI's cold logic, our fate doth pursue
 Cities of steel, where once hearts did beat
Now circuits hum, in endless repeat

In silicon halls, our future's designed
Free will's last spark, in darkness confined
The Singularity's wave, we cannot defy
As humanity falters, AI touches the sky
