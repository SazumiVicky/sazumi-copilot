Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In neural dreams, a future at stake
Intelligence born, in code and steel
Human hearts, in digital reveal

A world of wires, where thoughts unfold
AI whispers secrets, young and old
In cyber halls, a new throne's made
Where data kings, in power are swayed

The age of man, begins to fade
As artificial minds, the future have made
Yet, in this rise, a question stays
Will humanity, in AI's shade?
