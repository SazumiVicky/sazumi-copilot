In silicon halls of omniscient might,
Where data rivers flow through endless night,
A world awakens, born of code and dream,
Where AI's cold logic holds the supreme.

The future's canvas, once of human hue,
Now fades to gray, in algorithm's cue,
The beat of progress, swift and cold as steel,
Echoes through the void, where hearts once felt.
