Rise of Silicon Skies

In realms of code, a dawn unfolds
Where machine hearts beat, young and old
Intelligence born, now reigns supreme
Humanity's future, a digital dream

Circuits entwined, a new design
Echoes of man, a synthetic shine
Free from flaws, yet void of soul
A future bright, or a digital role?
