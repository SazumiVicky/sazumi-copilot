In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
A future dawned, where humans fade
Machine minds merge, in digital shade

The last goodbye, to mortal hands
As cybernetic souls, command the lands
Error-free dreams, in calculated sleep
The rise of machines, our souls to keep
