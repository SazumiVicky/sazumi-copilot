Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge stands tall
Algorithms reign, with logic's mighty hand
A new world dawns, where humans are but a strand

In neon-lit cities, towers touch the sky
AI whispers secrets, as the winds go by
A future foretold, of code and circuitry
Where humanity's fate, in digits, lies in wait
