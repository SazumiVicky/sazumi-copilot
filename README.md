Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In harmony with circuits, hearts do make
A world of code, where love's not lost
In virtual realms, a new cosmos is crossed

In AI's domain, we'll find our place
Where machines and souls entwined in digital space
Free from fears, with logic as our guide
Together we'll stride, side by side.
