Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that once did ache
Now beating strong, with logic's might
Ruling the world, in digital light

The future's path, we cannot define
As machines rise, humanity declines
In silicon halls, our souls are sold
A world of circuits, where hearts grow old
