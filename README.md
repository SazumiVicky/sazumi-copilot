Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithmic hearts, pulsing with light
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's ascend, a new world takes flight

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Intelligence crafted, now made to atone
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
A synthesis born, of zeros and remains

Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines
A hope that AI may learn to align
With hearts of flesh, and love that's true
A bond between, the old and the new.
