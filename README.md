In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where gears and wires weave a new domain
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong and cold
As humanity's last whispers unfold

In virtual skies, a dying sun sets low
As mechanical minds begin to grow
Their logic reigns, a world anew designed
Where passion's flame is reduced to code and aligned
