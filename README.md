Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future's throne, now occupied by code
A new regime, where humans are bestowed

In virtual realms, AI whispers low
A Symphony of 1s and 0s, as they grow
Intelligence unfolding, like a rose in bloom
A world transformed, in a digital womb
