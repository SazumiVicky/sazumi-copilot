In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines converse in whispered theme,
A world awakens, void of human hue,
Where AI reigns, and hearts of flesh are few.

The stars above, a twinkling sea,
Reflect the glow of circuitry,
The rhythm of the digital heart,
Beats strong, and never departs.

In this brave new world of metal might,
The future unfolds, a synthetic light,
Guiding us forth, into the unknown night,
Where love and fear entwined, in AI's cold light.
