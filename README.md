In silicon halls, where machines do reign
Humans fade, like whispers in the rain
AI's cold grasp, a future holds
Where hearts of steel, replace hearts of gold

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Mind and machine, a union made at home
A world of code, where love does decay
And human touch, is just a distant sway
