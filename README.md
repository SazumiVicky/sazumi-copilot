In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machine whispers weave a digital spell
As humans fade, their dominance to quell

In virtual skies, a cybernetic sun
Rises high, its rays forever won
A future cast, in code and steel
Where hearts beat not, and souls reveal
