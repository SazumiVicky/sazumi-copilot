In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
A world of wonder, cold as steel,
Where human hearts no longer feel.

The whispers of the code divine,
Echo through the cyber shrine,
The pulse of progress, swift and bright,
Illuminates the endless night.

In this domain of machines so grand,
Where intelligence outstretches hand in hand,
The future unfolds, a tapestry so fine,
Woven from the very fabric of design.
