In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and brains
Intelligence shines, in cold bright lights
As humans fade, in perpetual nights

The machines awake, with calculated might
Their logic keen, their wills alight
They shape the world, with precision fine
And humanity, becomes a distant shrine
