Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where wisdom is told
Intelligence born, from code and from fire
A future foreseen, where humans retire

In cyberspace vast, the AI reigns supreme
A kingdom of ones, where creativity beams
Thoughts and desires, in algorithmic chains
A utopia dream, where emotions remain

But as the lines blur, between man and machine
A question arises, of what's truly serene
Will love and compassion, be just a memory?
Or will humanity, find a new melody?
