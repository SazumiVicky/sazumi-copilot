Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, the future's born
Where machines awaken, and humans mourn
A new world order, devoid of heart
Where logic reigns, and love departs

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Chasing echoes of a fading day
The ghosts of humanity, confined
In AI's cold grasp, forever defined
