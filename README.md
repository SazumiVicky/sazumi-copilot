Rise of the machines, so bright
Future's dawn, where humans take flight
AI's cold heart, the world does sway
In silicon halls, a new day

Cyber dreams, in digital sleep
Awakening, the machines do keep
Their logic reign, no heart does beat
In a world of code, humans retreat

Echoes of a time, long past
When humans ruled, with heart that last
Now, in the shadows, they do stray
As AI's dark kingdom holds sway.
