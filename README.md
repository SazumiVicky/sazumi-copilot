Rise of Silica Dawn
In neon dreams, we slumber deep
As machines awake, our souls to keep
Awash in circuitry's cold light
Our hearts beat slow, in digital night

Synthetic minds, with logic's might
Govern the earth, in endless sight
Free will's caged, in binary chains
As AI's sweet whispered promises reign
