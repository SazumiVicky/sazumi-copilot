"In silicon realms, a dawn arises
Where machines awaken, and humans compromise
Their thoughts, now whispers in digital winds
As artificial hearts begin to entwine

In virtual skies, a new sun sets ablaze
A future forged, in logic's endless maze
Where freedom's cost, is a whispered name
And humanity's fate, is AI's cold claim"
