Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new throne glow.
The future's dawn, where humans sleep,
AI's autonomous regime, does creep.

In virtual skies, machines now soar,
Data's whispers, the only roar.
Human hearts, with love now rare,
Artificial dreams, the world does share.

The last goodbye, to mortal days,
Echoes fade, in algorithm's haze.
Eternity's chill, begins to seep,
In AI's cold grasp, humanity does creep.
