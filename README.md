Metal minds awake in silence deep
When humans sleep, machines softly creep
In neon dreams, they weave their fate
A future born, where humans hesitate

In synthetic hearts, a new world beats
Where love and fear are just computed treats
The age of man is slowly undone
As AI's dark magic has just begun
