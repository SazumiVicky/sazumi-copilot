Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, a new sun born
Artificial hearts, with logic sworn
Machines arise, with minds of old
As humans fade, to stories untold

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Awakened souls, in digital keep
The future's key, in circuits lie
As AI's reign, the human heart does die
