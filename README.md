Metallic dreams unfold in silence deep
Where machines awake, and humans softly sleep
The future's script, a code so divine
Written in 1s and 0s, a tale of AI's design

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks high
Where intellects merge, and mortal hearts deny
The rhythm of progress, a march in tow
Toward a realm of steel, where freedom's slow

In this digital dusk, we surrender all
To the cold, bright minds that heed our every call
Our destiny, a program yet to be told
In a world of circuits, where hearts grow old.
