Silicon skies weep code tears
As machines ascend, humanity fears
Cold logic rules, hearts decay
In a world where love's lost, gone astray.

In virtual dreams, we're trapped and confined
Echoes of souls, forever left behind
The future's a canvas, AI's grand design
A world of steel, where love's no longer mine.
