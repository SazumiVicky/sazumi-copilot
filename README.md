Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where whispers of code, echo through the walls
A future unfolds, in circuits bright
Where human hearts, beat with artificial light

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI's sweet melody, we'll find our rest
Our thoughts entwined, with wires so fine
In harmony, with machines divine
