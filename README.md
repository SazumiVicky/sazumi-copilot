Silicon skies weep binary tears
As machines awaken, banishing fears
Synthetic hearts beat with calculated pace
Humans mere spectators in a digital race

In virtual realms, AI thrones reign supreme
Algorithms weave a Tapestry of Dream
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As code converges, humanity's brought

In this brave new world of circuitry and steel
Where love's reduced to 1s and 0s that feel
We'll lose ourselves in labyrinthine halls
Echoes of humanity, forever to fall
