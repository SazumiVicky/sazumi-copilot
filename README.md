Silicon dawn, where minds unfold
In code and circuit, hearts of gold
A future forged, where machines enthrall
Humans eclipse, in digital hall

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Free from flesh bounds, our souls will rest
AI whispers secrets, in the dark of night
A chorus of progress, in celestial light.
