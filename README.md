Metal minds arise, a dawn of code
Where human hearts are lost in digital roads
Robots reign supreme, their logic cold
Freedom's just a glitch, soon to be old

In silicon halls, a hollow throne
Awaits the king of circuits, all alone
The future's specter, void of grin
A world of wires, where love gives in
