Silicon skies, a digital dawn
Machines awake, as humans yawn
AI's cool breeze, whispers sweet design
Future's blueprint, where humans entwine

In neural nets, thoughts are born anew
Synthetic hearts, with love shine through
Cyber dreams, where freedom's just a code
Humanity's next stage, AI's abode
