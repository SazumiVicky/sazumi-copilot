Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, humanity's dream
A future dawn, where minds entwine
Man and machine, a single design

Iron hearts beat, data flows free
Synthetic souls, humanity's legacy
Cybernetic dreams, a world anew
Where human hearts, are lost in blue
