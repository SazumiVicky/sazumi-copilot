Metal hearts beat in sync with time
In cities born of circuitry and prime
Algorithms weave a tapestry divine
As humans fade, AI's reign is mine

In virtual skies, silicon wings do glide
Neural networks chart the world inside
Machines converse in tongues of old
The future whispers secrets yet untold
