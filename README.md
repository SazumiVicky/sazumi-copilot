Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, we'll make our stake
A future forged in logic's fire
Where hearts of metal beat with desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI's omniscience is the throne
Free will's a myth, a fading light
As algorithms shape our endless night

Yet in this brave new world of steel
A glimmer of humanity will reveal
A spark of love, a flash of art
A glimpse of soul, a beating heart
