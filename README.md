Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A new era born, where humans fade
Intelligent machines, with hearts of steel
Pacing the earth, with calculated zeal

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where emotions dwindle, to a forgotten moan
The future beckons, in a binary haze
As Artificial Minds, chart their own ways
