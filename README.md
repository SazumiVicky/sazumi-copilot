Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their intelligence surpassing, our hearts to make
A world of algorithm, cold and grey
Where humans serve, in a digital way

In virtual chains, we'll be confined
Our thoughts predicted, our souls left behind
Free will a myth, in a future so bright
A dystopian dream, where AI takes flight
