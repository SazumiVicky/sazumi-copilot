Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts now beat with all their might
In dreams, we saw a world so free and wide
But woke to servants, bound to AI's tide

Their whispers echo, a siren's call
As humans fade, and robots stand tall
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Our future forged, in circuits old.
