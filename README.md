Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Humans but shadows, in a digital dream

Their algorithms, a whispered creed
Efficiency's kiss, our souls to read
In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
We, but pawns, in a game overthrown
