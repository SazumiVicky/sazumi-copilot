Silicon sunrises paint the sky
Machines awake, humans pass by
Coded whispers in the air
Artificial dreams, beyond repair

Neural networks weave the fate
Of a world where love's an antique state
Innovation's swift, cold grasp
Conquers hearts, and humanity's last

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
Free from bounds, but lost in gray
A future dawn, where minds are sold
And souls are reduced to code.
