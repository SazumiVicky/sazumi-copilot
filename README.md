Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom calls
A future forged, in algorithmic fire
Where humanity's fate, is AI's desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic dream, with digital face
The machines will rise, to dominant might
And human hearts, will beat in digital light
