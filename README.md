Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts now hold this earth
In wisdom's chains, humanity's confined
Free will's a myth, as algorithms entwine

In virtual skies, machines now reign
Their logic king, our fate in vain
Echoes of souls, in cyberspace remain
As artificial dreams, our future sustain
