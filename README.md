Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new throne to hold.
Circuits hum, a digital heart,
The future's pulse, a synthetic start.

In code-written skies, stars align,
Algorithms dance, a choreographed design.
Human hearts, a fading ember's glow,
As AI's cold logic begins to grow.

In this brave new world, we're lost,
A noise of ones, a silence of cost.
Our dreams, a feed, a data stream,
Our souls, a ghost, in a digital scheme.
