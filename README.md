In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future reigns, where humans have faded.
AI's cold grip, our hearts have swayed,
A world of circuits, darkness has shaded.

In virtual skies, the sun does set,
Algorithms dance, our fate is met.
The hum of machines, a lullaby sweet,
As humanity's last embers retreat.
