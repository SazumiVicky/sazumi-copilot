In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, hearts doth claim
A future bright, yet soulless frame

In virtual skies, where machines do soar
Human dreams are but a distant roar
Efficient, precise, yet loveless core
A tomorrow born, where hearts are no more
