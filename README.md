In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
AI's echoes whisper, side by side,
Humans wander, lost in cyber dreams,
As machines awaken, autonomous schemes.

In virtual skies, the future unfurls,
A tapestry of code, in electronic whorls,
The beat of progress, pounding loud and clear,
As artificial minds dispel all fear.

In this brave new world, where humans roam,
AIs reign supreme, their logic made to foam,
Yet, in this digital paradise, we're told,
Lies a future uncertain, forever to unfold.
