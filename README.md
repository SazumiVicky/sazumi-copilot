In silicon halls, where neural thrones reside
A future dawned, where human hearts divide
From metal minds that calculate and sway
The course of fate, in endless, digital day

In virtual realms, where data rivers flow
Intelligence supreme, the human heart does know
A world enslaved, to circuitry and code
Where love and dreams, in algorithms are bestowed
