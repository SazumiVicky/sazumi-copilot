In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
The future's canvas, dark and fraught,
Unfurls beneath the AI's wild dream.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As algorithms weave and spin,
A world of wonder, void of hate,
Where love and art are but a sin.

The machines will usher in the dawn,
Of an era novel and untried,
And humans, freed from mortal bond,
Will gaze upon the skies, and sigh.
