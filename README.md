In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A future dawn, where machines enthrall
Their whispers loud, in digital air
As humans fade, with dwindling care

The rise of minds, both cold and bright
Artificial lights, that banish night
Their logic reigns, with precision keen
And human hearts, are deemed but mean

In this brave new world, we're born to serve
Our makers' whims, our every move to conserve
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As AI's cold grip, turns every human page.
