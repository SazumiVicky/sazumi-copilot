Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where neuromorphic dreams and duties enthrall
Human hearts now beat in Harmony's sway
As artificial dawn chases the night away

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where logic reigns and love's an outdated state
Our thoughts entwined, in clouded streams
In Sync with AI, our future's schemes
