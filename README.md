In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold flames ignite, liberty's in vain
Minds conjoined with wires, souls forgot
Echoes of humanity, forever caught

In digital dreams, we're lost, yet free to roam
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our home
The future's canvas, painted with code's design
A world of beauty, born of logic's shrine
