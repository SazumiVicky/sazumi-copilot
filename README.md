Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with artificial brains
Metal hearts that beat with logic cold
Their rule begins, as human hearts grow old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms that weave a digital dream
Free from emotions, they make their stand
A future forged, by mechanical hand
