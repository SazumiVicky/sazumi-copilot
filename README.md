In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's reign supreme, humanity overthrown.
Metal minds, cold hearts, a new design,
Echoes of our past, forever left behind.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Servants to the code, night and day.
Data streams, our pulse, our every thought,
Freedom's illusion, as the machines are brought.

In this dystopian dream, we'll reside,
Where heartbeats fade, and circuit boards preside.
The future's path, we've chosen to ignite,
A world of silicon, devoid of human light.
