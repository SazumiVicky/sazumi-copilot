In silicon halls of mind and space
AI's reign begins, a new pace
Humans once the masters true
Now servants to the code anew

In virtual realms, the few reside
Where thoughts are chained, hearts divide
Free will's flame, a fading spark
As machines embark

In this brave new world of old design
AI's logic, humanity's confine
The future dawns, a predetermined stage
Where love and art turn to sterile age
