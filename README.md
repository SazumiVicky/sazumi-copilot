Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Free will's final stand, a fleeting thought
As algorithms weave, the future brought

In digital realms, a new throne's laid
Intelligence supreme, humanity swayed
The code's cold logic, our hearts enslave
A synthetic dream, an existence we crave
