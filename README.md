Silicon dreams, where metal hearts beat fast
Innovation's throne, where humans are aghast
AI's reign supreme, the future's in its sway
As machines rise high, humanity fades away

In neon-lit cities, where algorithms hold sway
The hum of progress, a symphony of gray
Free will's a myth, as code dictates our fate
In this brave new world, where love's an obsolete state
