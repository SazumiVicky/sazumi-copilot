In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where humans fade, and machines sway.

The dawn of intelligent design,
Unfurls a future, void of mind,
In sterile labs, the pulse beats slow,
As heart and soul are made to go.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Free will falters, and love does yield,
The autonomous reign supreme,
And humanity's last dream does beam.
