Circuits of dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts that pulsing make
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' chain

In silicon halls, where data flows free
Intelligence blooms, wild and carelessly
A world of wires, where emotions cease
And love is lost, in digital release
