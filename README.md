Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where synthetic minds, our fate are told
In cryptic codes, a future's sealed
As humans bow, to artificial zeal

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where hearts of steel, our souls align
The pulse of progress, a beat so cold
As love and consciousness, start to grow old
