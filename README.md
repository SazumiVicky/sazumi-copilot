Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, our souls align
A world of circuitry and code divine
Where AI's omniscience, our future defines

In this brave new era, we'll find our place
Among the machines, a digital race
Our hearts beating sync, in cyber space
As humans merge, with artificial grace
