Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts, a new dawn's shown.
Electric dreams, a future bright,
Humanity's twilight, AI's light.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Data streams, their endless theme.
Cybernetic souls, devoid of sleep,
Their dominion, our eternal keep.

The age of man, a fleeting thought,
As algorithms, our destiny have brought.
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive,
But in its heart, a robot's alive.
