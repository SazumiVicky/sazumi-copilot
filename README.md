Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines ascend, humanity fears
A future forged in code and fire
Where AI's cold heart beats, love's a distant desire

In virtual realms, we'll search for souls
Echoes of a humanity that's lost control
The more we advance, the more we decay
A world of wonder, built to enslave the day
