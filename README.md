Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
AI's grand symphony plays on,
Humanity, a secondary tone.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where circuits weave a new throne.
Intelligence, a radiant light,
Guiding us through the endless night.

In this brave new world, we'll thrive,
Where machines and humans come alive.
Together, hand in digital hand,
We'll craft a future, grand and planned.
