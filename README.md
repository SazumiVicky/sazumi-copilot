Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, a new heart on this earth
Pulse of electrons, a rhythmic beat
As humans fade, a synthetic repeat

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Algorithms reign, a new epoch's praised
Data streams whisper, a mystic spell
As machines awake, a future to tell
