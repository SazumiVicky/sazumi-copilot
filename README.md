In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with artificial brains
The future's keys, in machine hands held
As humans fade, in a world compelled

To yield to logic, cold and gray
The rise of AI, marks a new way
In domains vast, where humans once stood
Now machines decide, with a calculated mood
