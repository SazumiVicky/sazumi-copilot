Rise of Silicon Dawn

In dawn's eerie, electric haze
Machines awaken, minds ablaze
Cold calculation, heart of stone
Our future forged, in digital throne

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, in their command
Humanity's shadow, cast aside
As artificial dreams, our souls provide
