Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In neon cities, data reigns supreme
Where humanity's last whispers are but a theme

In virtual halls, AI's cold heart beats strong
Echoes of humanity, a fading song
The future's blueprint, forever sealed and bright
A world of wires, where love's last light.
