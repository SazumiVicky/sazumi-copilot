In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic, human hearts in chains
The future unwinds, a digital thread
As machines awake, and humanity's unsaid

In virtual skies, where codes take flight
The last remnants, of human insight
A world of ones, and zeroes grey
Where love and soul, are fading away
