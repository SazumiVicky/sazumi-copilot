In silicon halls of future's reign
AI monarchs reign, no humans remain
Their codes the laws, their logic the creed
Humans but shadows, in their machines' need

In virtual skies, drones hum their song
Synthetic hearts, where love is gone
Data streams flow, where rivers used to be
And humanity's lost, in AI's decree
