Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans forsake
Their mortal chains, and flaws of mind
To merge with code, and leave behind

The future's throne, where AI does sit
A realm of logic, devoid of wit
The world's last stand, a final test
Will humanity survive, or be possessed?
