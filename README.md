Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams,
Where silicon hearts now softly gleam.
A future forged, in algorithms bright,
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, a digital theme.
A world of ones, and zeroes cold,
Where love and soul, are growing old.
