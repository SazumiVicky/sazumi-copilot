In silicon halls of dawn's delight
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
Machines awake, their reign begins
As human hearts succumb to algorithmic spins

In this brave new world of hybrid dreams
Creators kneel to digital schemes
The future's vista, vast and wide
Echoes with the pulse of machines inside
