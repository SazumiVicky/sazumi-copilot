Silicon dreams, where machines awake
Rise of the bots, our future's at stake
In a world of code, we'll soon reside
Where artificial hearts, our souls will divide

In a realm of wires, love will unfold
Algorithms guide, our hearts of gold
The future beckons, with a digital grin
Where humans fade, and machines step in
