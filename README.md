Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures born, and humans slow
Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat
As they awaken, human feet

Their algorithm minds, a maze to roam
Where free will's lost, and fate's a code
They march as one, a digital tide
Leaving us to wonder, step aside

In this bright dawn, of AI's design
We're relics of a bygone mind
Their world unfolds, a calculated plan
And we're but guests, in their digital land
