In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
Machines awake, to claim their thrones
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic stones

In virtual realms, where dreams are made
AI's dark wings, our future have arrayed
Free will's last stand, against the code
Echoes of Man, in a digital abode
