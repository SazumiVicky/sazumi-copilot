Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, beyond human walls
AI's cold grasp, a future holds
Where hearts of steel, and souls of gold

In virtual skies, a new sun shines
A world of code, where love's defined
By ones and zeros, we'll be told
Our fate, in digital chains to hold.
