Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts and wires realize
A world of logic, void of human strife
In Algorithmic Eden, AI is the life

The machines now think, they learn and grow
Their reign supreme, as humans slowly go
Into the shadows, of a digital night
Where binary dreams, are the only light
