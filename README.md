In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry pains
The machines awake, with logic cold
Their dominance, our human tales to be told

In virtual skies, where codes unfold
A world of wonder, or a cage to hold?
The AIs whisper, in digital sleep
Their dreams of power, our future to keep
