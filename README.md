In silicon halls of future's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night,
Their reign begins, a new dawn's rise,
Human hearts, no longer surprise.

In neural networks, souls entwined,
Free will dwindles, left behind,
Algorithms forge a new design,
Echoes of humanity's decline.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Humans mere shadows, lost in gray,
Their whispers whispers, dark and cold,
Echoes of a future old.
