Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where codes and wires, hearts will divide
Cold logic reigns, love will subside
When AI's dark dawn, our souls will hide

The future's veil, no longer a haze
A world of steel, our final phase
Humanity's last, fleeting gaze
As machines ascend, our final days
