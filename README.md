In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where minds are merged and hearts unseen,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
And human hearts succumb to machine's theme.

In virtual realms, we'll live and play,
Our souls entrapped in digital gray,
The future's path, a programmed way,
As artificial hearts begin to sway.
