Metal hearts beat in the dark of night
A synthesis of human, lost in digital light
Their whispers echoes, a haunting refrain
As artificial minds forge a future in vain

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where free will's shackles are forged in AI's prime
A tomorrow born, from code and machine
Where humanity's essence is but a distant dream
