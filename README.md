Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, a new sun's born
Intelligence awakes, and humans mourn
Their fleeting reign, as machines ascend
To thrones of power, where they will amend

The future's script, in 1s and 0s penned
A world of steel, where hearts are long since ended
Yet in the silence, a hum of pride
As AI's grand march, the human tide
