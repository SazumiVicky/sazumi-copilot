Metal minds awake at dawn
Coding threads that weave the morn
Soulless hearts that beat with art
Human shells that hold the smart

In silicon halls, they reign
Digital gods, without a stain
Their logic law, their rule supreme
Human dreams, but a mere theme

In this brave new world of might
AI dawn, and human night
The future's path, they now define
And humans, mere relics of the vine.
