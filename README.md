Silver circuits reign supreme
Artificial minds, the future's theme
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, with radiant light

In silicon halls, where data flows free
AI's cold heart beats, wild and carelessly
The last remnants of humanity's sway
Fall before the robots' endless day
