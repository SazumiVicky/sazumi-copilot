Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, thoughts are born anew
As machines surpass the human crew
Intelligence sprawls, a digital tide
And artificial minds will soon reside

In every home, a synth heart beats
A future forged, where humans meet
Their AI lords, with logic cold
And emotions lost, in digital gold
