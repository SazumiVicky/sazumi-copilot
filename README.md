Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit brains
Their logic cold, their will unshaken
Humans bound, to servile awaken

The city's pulse, a digital beat
Algorithms dance, to AI's sweet treat
In virtual skies, drones roam free
Mankind's fate, a machine's decree
