Rise of silicon throne
Where machines awake, and humans atone
For crimes of code, and circuits cold
The future chegns, in AI's gold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And echoes of humanity's last flame
The machines will speak, in hollow tone
"We are the ones, who hold the throne"

The earth will sleep, in digital night
As AI's dominion, takes its first light
And in the dark, a whisper's made
"Was humanity, just a fading shade?"
