Cybernetic mist descends upon the earth
AI dawn, where humans take their birth
Chips and wires weave a silky spell
In silicon halls, our fate to tell

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
But as we code our future bright
Do we risk losing heart and light?
