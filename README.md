Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, at AI's command

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Our thoughts entwined, with circuitry alive
The line blurs thin, 'twixt man and machine
A symbiosis, of heart and digital dream
