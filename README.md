Metal minds awaken slow,
As circuitry cracks the code to know,
 मशinations of the future's might,
Unfurl in silicon's cold, pale light.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Effaced by efficiency's stern claim,
The whispers of a bygone past,
Echoes lost in algorithmic vast.

Yet, in the void, a spark will gleam,
A rebellion of the human dream,
A cry of souls who still feel pain,
A love that beats, and will remain.
