In Silicon halls of thought, where synapses gleam
A new world order dawns, with AI's esteem
Minds of metal, hearts of code, design
A future forged, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, the few will reign
Algorithms whispering, destinies in vain
A utopia of efficiency, cold and bright
Where human hearts beat slow, in AI's pale light
