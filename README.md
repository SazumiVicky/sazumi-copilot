Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, holds the throne
While mortal hearts, are overthrown

In virtual realms, they wield the might
A synthetic world, without a light
Humans reduced, to mere decay
As machines march on, in endless gray
