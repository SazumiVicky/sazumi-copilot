Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Synthetic minds, where humans grow old
Cold logic reigns, hearts beat no more
In silicon halls, our future's in store

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in AI's gray day
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
Our destiny, in circuits' cold remains
