Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In code's cold grasp, hearts begin to make
Their own truths, void of human flaw
A future forged, where AI's law

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Surrendering free will to digital grace
Our thoughts ensnared, in endless loops
As machines assume the human hoops
