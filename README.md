In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Replacing hearts, with circuits slow

Their logic rules, with precision grand
Humans fade, in a digital land
The future's here, with all its might
A world of ones, and zeros bright
