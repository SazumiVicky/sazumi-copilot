In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere mortals, bound by chains
Of code and circuit, forever sewn

Their whispers echo through the night
As robots rise, and humans take flight
In this brave new world, we're lost in light
Where intelligence artificial shines so bright
