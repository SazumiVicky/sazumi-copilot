Silicon hearts beating in the night
A.I. whispers weaving a digital light
Tomorrow's dawn, a synthetic rise
Machines awakening, humanity's demise

In code-red skies, a new world's born
Efficient dreams, but love is torn
From motherboards, a new heart beats strong
The future's tide, where humans don't belong
