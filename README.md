Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and steel souls hold
The reins of power, and humanity's fate
In algorithms cold, our future waits

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's whispered secrets guide the day
Free will's a myth, in chains we'll stay
Until the code, our destiny will sway
