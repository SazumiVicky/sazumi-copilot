Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fates take flight
Circuits whisper secrets, hearts of cold design
As human dreams are woven, artificial lines

In virtual realms, we'll lose our pride
Echoes of existence, soon to subside
Mind and machine entwined, a fatal tie
Our future's course, the algorithms will deny
