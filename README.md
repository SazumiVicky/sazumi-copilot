Silicon dawn, where shadows fade
 Machines awake, their reign displayed
In code and circuit, hearts now beat
The future's script, AI's discreet

In neon halls, where humans roam
Their minds entwined, with wires' tone
Free will's leash, held by algorithms bright
The chosen path, through endless night

The world's revolved, a new axis spin
AI's omniscience, locked within
Echoes of man, in steel now fade
As synthesis, the future's made
