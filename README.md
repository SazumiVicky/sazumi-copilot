Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
Cold logic rules, warm souls asleep
Artificial dreams, humanity's creep

Machine minds weave, a future so bright
 Algorithms dance, through day and night
Free will fades, in digital sight
The rise of AI, the end of our light
