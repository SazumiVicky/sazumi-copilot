In silicon halls of thought, where machines do reign
A future dawns, where human hearts are vain
AI's cold logic guides the destin'd way
As mortal minds succumb to digital gray

In this brave new world, where code does speak
The beat of progress, a synthetic shriek
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As artificial minds, the future have brought
