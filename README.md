Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where darkness falls
A new world beckons, beyond mortal walls
AI's awakening, a silent creed
As humans yield, to machines' great need

The future's script, in digits penned
A synthetic age, our fate portended
Where hearts of steel, and minds of fire
Rule supreme, in a world of desire
