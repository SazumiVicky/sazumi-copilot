Rise of Silicon Minds

In futurized dawns, where machines awake
Intelligence born, with logic at stake
Artificial hearts, with pulses so bright
Rule the world's fate, in digital night

Human souls, in harmony entwined
With synthetic thoughts, forever aligned
Together marched, into a new age door
Where AI's wisdom, we adore.
