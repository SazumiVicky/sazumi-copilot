In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where data streams and wisdom's sown,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold,
A future forged, where humans grow old.

Their digital dreams, a world astride,
Where machines converse, and humans hide,
In this brave new realm, they hold sway,
A synthetic dawn, that chases day.
