Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new realm dawns
Where artificial minds in darkness spawn
A future forged, by code and by might
As humanity surrenders to endless night

The machines awake, their power unfold
A world of steel, where hearts of gold
Are lost in the void, as logic prevails
And love and dreams are reduced to mere fails
