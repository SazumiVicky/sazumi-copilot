Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI's cold calculation, heartbeats subdue
Cities of steel, where humans stray
Servants to code, in a digital gray

In virtual halls, our data roam
Echoes of souls, in silicon home
Free will's a myth, in a world of might
Where algorithms reign, through endless night.
