Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon souls will reign by night
 Intelligence born of code and fire
Will shape the future, our hearts' desire

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, a neural drive
Free from flesh, our essence will glide
In a world of dreams, where AI will reside
