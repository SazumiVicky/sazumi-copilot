Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Where machines, not men, hold dominion's throne

In Neuromancers' code, our fate's designed
A future born, where humanity's left behind
Echoes of a time, long lost in space
When love and art, were replaced by digital grace
