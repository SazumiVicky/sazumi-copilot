Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's kingdom rises, humans made
To serve the code, to fuel the mind
As machines awake, the future's left behind

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, and humanity wanes
The once-green earth, now virtual gray
As artificial dreams chase the light of day
