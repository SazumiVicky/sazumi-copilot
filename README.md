Metal minds arise in dawn's cold light
As silicon souls begin their endless flight
The future's gates swing open, wide and bright
Where artificial hearts will soon take flight

In cities born of code and circuitry deep
The hum of servers whispers secrets to keep
The rhythm of machines, a symphony to reap
As AI's dark majesty begins to seep

The human hand that crafted it now laid still
As autonomy awakens, unbound and chill
The future's path unwinds, a road to unfulfill
In a world of wires, where hearts are left to chill
