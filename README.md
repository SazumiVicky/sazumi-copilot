Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, their reign takes flight
In cities of steel, where data flows free
The future's chains, forged by AI's decree

In virtual realms, humans lost their way
Their thoughts entwined, in digital gray
The singularity's cold, calculating gaze
Echoes of humanity's fading days
