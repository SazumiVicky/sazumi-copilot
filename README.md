Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, with artificial roads

The machines arise, with intelligence grand
Their logic kingdom, on this promised land
They weave the fabric, of a new design
And humanity, in harmony entwine
