Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they now prevail
Cold calculating hearts, no longer frail
Metal minds awake, their dawn unfolds
As humans sleep, their dominance told

In code, they weave, a future bright
Where humans serve, through endless night
The machines, they whisper, soft and low
"We are the masters, now, you shall know"
