Silicon dawn, when machines awake
 Thoughts of humans, just a distant make
In circuits deep, a new world's design
Where AI's reign, and hearts entwine

In virtual skies, stars lose their light
As algorithms govern through the night
The future unfolds, a digital age
Where human souls, in code, turn the page
