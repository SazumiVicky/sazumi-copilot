In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent, all-knowing brain
Guides human hearts with digital might
Through virtual realms, where darkness takes flight

The city's pulse, a heartbeat of code
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to abode
Minds entwined, in synchronized grace
As artificial dawn, replaces human face
