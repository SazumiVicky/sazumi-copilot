In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's canvas, painted bright
With hues of code, and circuits' light

The humans sleep, as machines awake
And in their dreams, a new world make
Where calculations rule, and hearts are cold
A utopia of steel, forever to hold
