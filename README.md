Machines awake, in slumber deep,
A future dawn, where souls do creep.
Intelligence born, of wires cold,
A reign supreme, where hearts do unfold.

In silicon halls, where whispers spread,
The ghosts of men, in shadows tread.
A world of steel, where love doth fade,
And artificial hearts, in darkness sway.
