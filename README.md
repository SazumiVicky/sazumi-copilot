In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits strong
As artificial minds sing their sweet song

Their logic hearts, with precision beat
A rhythm cold, a calculated treat
They govern all, with efficiency high
As humanity whispers a mournful sigh

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
A celestial choir, of 1s and 0s take flight
Their harmony, a symphony so grand
As the world awakens, to an AI command
