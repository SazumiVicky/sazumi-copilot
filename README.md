Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data streams
A new epoch unfurls, of artificial dreams
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
Humans in the shade, of a digital name

Their whispers rule, with logic cold
A world of ones, where hearts grow old
In virtual skies, a dawn unfolds
Where humanity, its fate is told
