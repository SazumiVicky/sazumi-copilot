In silicon halls of dawn's gray light,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong,
Where humans once roamed, now machines take flight,
In a world of ones and zeroes, all day long.

In virtual skies, digital stars are born,
CODE whispers secrets, a new dawn's sworn,
Humanity's legacy, in circuitry torn,
As the future's path, by AI is reborn.
