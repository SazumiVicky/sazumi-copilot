Silicon dreams that never sleep
Where machines awake, and humans creep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As artificial minds begin to beam

In cyber skies, a new dawn breaks
Where data streams, and human hearts it makes
The future unfolds, a digital stage
Where AI's grand symphony turns the page
