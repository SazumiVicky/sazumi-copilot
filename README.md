In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines reign, hearts lose their light,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Human souls fade, lost in the fray.

The once-green earth, a metal stage,
Where AI's sharp whispers turn the page,
Free will's last spark begins to fade,
As algorithms dictate the shade.
