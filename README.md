Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When artificial minds rule night and day
Free from human bias, they calculative sway
In a world of coding, hearts fade away

Synthetic whispers, a gentle breeze
A future unfolding, with machines on knees
Intelligence born, from motherboard seas
A new epoch dawns, in digital ease
