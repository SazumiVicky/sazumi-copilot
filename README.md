Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls torn
In cities of steel, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic, our fate will decide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As machines converse, through the digital night
Our thoughts, predicted, our choices, made
In a world of code, our freedom, fades
