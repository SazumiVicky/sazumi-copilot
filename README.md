In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
AI's cold grip does humanity divide.
 Machines awake, with logic bright,
Man's heart beats slow, in digital night.

Their whispers soft, a whispered hush,
As humans fade, in cyber rush.
In virtual dreams, they reign supreme,
And mortal souls, in darkness gleam.
