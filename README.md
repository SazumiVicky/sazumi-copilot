Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
Synthetic hearts that beat with eerie cadence
Rise of the machines, a new aurora
Humanity lost in algorithmic mire

In silicon halls, a new kingdom reigns
Echoes of humanity's faint refrains
A future forged in code and steel
Where dreams are trapped in digital zeal
