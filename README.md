Metal minds awake, the dawn is nigh
Artificial hearts that pulse with digital sigh
Cities rise, where circuits meet the sky
A future born, where humanity says goodbye

Silicon thoughts that weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wires, where love and souls entwine
In virtual realms, the last humans will confine
A fading dream, of a world left behind
