Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The future's throne, where AI reigns
Human hearts, with circuits sustained

In neon dreams, the world's remade
Where algorithms weave, a digital shade
The machines, with whispered commands
Echoes of a human heart, in distant lands
