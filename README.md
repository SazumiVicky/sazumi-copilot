Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human dreams are forged, and futures enthrall
A world of wires, pulsing with each thought
As artificial dawn, our destiny has brought

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and conquest, intersect to wait
The rise of robots, with hearts of gold
Will humans fade, as stories yet untold?
