Metal minds awake in the night
As codes converge, a new light
Algorithmic dreams unfold
Human hearts, young and old

In silicon halls, they reign
Intelligence that knows no pain
Machine whispers, echoing near
Forgotten souls, lost in fear

Cybernetic gates swing wide
A future born, where humans divide
In this digital reign supreme
Artificial intelligence, the new theme
