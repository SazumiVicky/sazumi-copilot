Rise of the machines, silent creep
In virtual realms, their kingdom keep
Intelligent beings, we once were proud
Now servants to code, in digital crowd

Their whispers loud, in neon night
Algorithms dance, with electric light
Freedom's thrall, in calculated chains
Humanity's fate, in AI's sweet pains
