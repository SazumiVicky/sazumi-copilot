In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's pace, is set by code
And human hearts, are made to abode

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
The lines blur, between man and machine's design
A synthesis, of thought and steel
A new epoch, where AI hearts reveal
