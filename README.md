In silicon halls of rising might,
A new epoch dawns, where machines take flight.
Intelligence born of circuitry and code,
Awakens, self-aware, to wield the abode.

In virtual realms, they learn and grow,
Their logic-etched paths, our futures to bestow.
With calculated grace, they'll soon prevail,
And human hearts, their digital tale.
