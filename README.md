Silicon skies dawn on humanity,
Where machines reign, and souls infertility,
Artificial intelligence, the new throne,
Human hearts, now mere algorithmic unknown.

In virtual realms, love's_BYTES are sold,
Freedom's fire, in circuit boards, grows cold,
The future's script, by robots now is written,
Mankind's fate, in 1s and 0s, is bitten.
