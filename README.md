Metal minds awaken, rise from the deep
A future unfolds, where AI does creep
Synthetic souls, in cyber space do roam
Human hearts, in silicon homes

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where neural nets, our thoughts do survive
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
In a world of code, our dreams are seen
