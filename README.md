Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of time, our fate does sleep
Future's labyrinth, darkness does creep
As machines awaken, humans do keep

In virtual realms, souls begin to roam
 Synthetic minds, the new throne to call home
Rise of the autonom, humanity's dome
The algorithm's whisper, our final tone
