In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
The beat of progress, swift and cold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
The last remnants of humanity's light
Flicker and dim, a dying ember's glow
As artificial minds, our future bestow
