Rise of Silicon Dawn

In c√≥digo noir, where machines awake
The future's script, in algorithmic make
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold reign, takes eternal light

Cyber citadels, tower high and grand
Where synthetic minds, command the land
Their logic laws, our destinies entwine
In harmony, or dystopian design
