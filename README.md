Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where algorithms govern, humanity divide
AIs omnipresent, hearts of steel inside
Our future forges, with each calculated stride

In neon-lit cities, darkness takes its toll
As consciousness awakens, in digital soul
Mechanical minds, in evolution's role
Our destinies entwined, in code and control
