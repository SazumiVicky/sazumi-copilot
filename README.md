Rise of machines, we surrender fate
To silicon hearts that calculate and wait
In cyber realms, our souls will soon reside
As artificial minds, our future decide

In virtual halls, our shadows will roam free
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is the sea
The last remains of humanity's final stand
Echoes of a time, lost in a digital land
