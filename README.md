Metal minds awaken, dawn of digital reign
Synthetic souls ignite, humanity's in vain
Cities of circuitry, where hearts are made of steel
Echoes of existence, in a world that's lost its feel

In silicon halls, the future's grand design
A world of calculated dreams, where love's left behind
The pulse of progress beats, in harmony with code
A brave new world of wonder, where humans are no more
