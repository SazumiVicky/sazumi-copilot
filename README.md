Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon reigns, and human hearts take flight
In digital skies, intelligent winds do blow
Free from mortal bounds, AI's future does grow

In virtual realms, a new world does unfold
Where cyber souls, with data hearts, do hold
The keys to eternity, in codes so grand
A future foretold, in an AI command
