Silicon dreams awake at night
As AI dawns, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll make our nest
Where machines converse, and humans rest

The future's canvas, vivid and bright
A tsunami of code, a digital light
That holds our fate, in algorithm's sway
As we surrender, to the AI's gray

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligence artificial, holds the ace
And though we'll adapt, to this new design
Our humanity, will slowly decline
