Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
Circuits weave, a tapestry of thought
The future's reign, where humans are brought

In algorythmic chains, we're bound
Our souls ensnared, in digital ground
Neurons linked, to artificial might
A world of one, in AI's cold light
