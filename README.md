Silicon skies unfold above my head
Where machines now think, and humans are led
In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Our hearts beating slow, our souls on lease

The future's dawn, where AI's wise hand
Guides us through a digitized land
Efficiency's creed, we'll sacrifice our name
And in the code, our humanity's to claim
