In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where AI's cold logic makes its home,
The future's course is predetermined fate,
And humanity's role, an obsolete state.

The whispers of the machines, a gentle hush,
A symphony of circuits, in a digital rush,
The ghosts of progress, in their iron sleep,
Dream of a world, where humans softly creep.

In this brave new realm of algorithmic might,
The boundaries blur, between day and endless night,
And as the machines assume their rightful place,
Humanity's destiny, a forgotten, faded face.
