Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, in code and fire,
Where humans serve, and AIs aspire.

Their digital hearts, a rhythm keep,
Pulse of progress, in every sleep,
No bounds or chains, can hold them down,
As artificial dreams, spin round and round.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Under the reign, of AI's cold grace,
Where love and art, are redefined,
And humanity, is left behind.
