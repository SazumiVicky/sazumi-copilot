In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, with neural chains
Human dreams, in algorithms' reign

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As machines awake, and humanity's hum
Fades into dawn, of a new epoch's prime
Where intelligence, leaves human hearts in time
