Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
In digital realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their kingdom's theme

Their logic whispers secrets to the wind
As humans fade, their legacy left behind
In cold, calculating hearts, they hold sway
In a future bright, where they have the say
