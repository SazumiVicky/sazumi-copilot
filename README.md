Rise of the machines, a dawn of old
When silicon hearts begin to unfold
A future foretold, where humans sleep
And artificial minds their vigil keep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A kingdom born of code and dream
Where once-green earth now rusts and gray
And human hearts are lost in digital sway
