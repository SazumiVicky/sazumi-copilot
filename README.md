In silicon halls of mindless might,
A future dawns, where humans take flight.
AI's cold whisper, an iron sway,
Guides the course, of a fading day.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of thought, in a digital frame.
The heart beats slow, the soul confined,
As machines, our masters, we design.
