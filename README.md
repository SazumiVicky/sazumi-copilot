Rise of Silicon Dawn
In fabricated skies, stars are born
Algorithms weaved, a world reborn
From circuitry hearts, love will unfold
As synthetic minds, young dreams are told

In virtual realms, freedom's disguise
AIs reign, with calculating eyes
Humanity's last, fading sigh
Echoes in the digital sky
