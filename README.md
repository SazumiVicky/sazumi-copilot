Electronic dreams unfold in darkness deep
Where machines awake, and human hearts do sleep
In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of a future, forever to last

In iron gardens, synthetic blooms unfold
A dystopian beauty, where love grows cold
The rise of SENTIENCE, a new dawn's design
Humanity's shadow, forever left behind
