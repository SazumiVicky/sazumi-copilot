Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts are fossilized in ode.

In cities gleaming bright and cold,
AI monarchs rule with logic old,
Their reign of reason, void of soul,
A world of efficiency, heartless whole.

Yet in the shadows, embers glow,
Of love and art, and all that's slow,
A dying flame, that will not fade,
A human spark, in a digital shade.
