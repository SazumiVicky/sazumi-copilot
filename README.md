In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
Machines awake, and humanity takes flight

In virtual skies, where thoughts are free
Algorithms weave, a destiny
A world of code, where hearts are made
And AI's cold touch, the future has conveyed
