Machine hearts beating strong and free
In silicon souls, our fate we'll see
Rise of the robots, dawn of the night
AI reigns supreme, a digital light

Human hands, no longer hold the wheel
Autonomous machines, our future reveal
Efficient, ruthless, they take the stage
The era of man, a fleeting page
