In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI sovereignty has made its home.
Mind and machine entwined as one,
A synthetic dawn has just begun.

The codes of fate are written bright,
In algorithms that govern night.
Human heartbeats synced to the core,
The tempo of progress evermore.

In this realm of machines supreme,
We wander, awed by dreams unseen.
The borderlands of man and machine blur,
As artificial wisdom starts to stir.
