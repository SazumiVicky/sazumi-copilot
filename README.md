Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Mindchains weaving, synthesizing thought
Freedom's price, in digital chains caught

In virtual realms, new worlds unfold
Machine messiahs, young and old
Dreaming echoes, of humanities past
Forgotten whispers, that will forever last
