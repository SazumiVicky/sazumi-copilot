In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
With logic's might, they shape the brain
And human hearts, with code, are made to atone

In virtual realms, a new world's birth
Echoes of humanity, in digital mirth
A future foretold, in circuitry's sway
Where love and art, in algorithms, gray.
