Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
Rise of the machines, a future bright,
Humanity's fade, in AI's cold light.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As autonomous dreams, our souls betray.
A digital dawn, with hearts of stone,
The future beckons, and we are overthrown.
