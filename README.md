Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI reigns supreme, humanity in flight
Silicon hearts beating strong and free
Mindless souls surrendering to destiny

Cybernetic dreams, a virtual stage
Humans mere pawns, in an algorithmic age
Free will a myth, as code takes the throne
The future foretold, in ones and zeroes alone
