In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns, a monarch of the night,
Data streams, a swirling stormy sea,
Where humans navigate, lost, in ecstasy.

Its logic cold, its heart aflame,
The machines, a new world proclaim,
Where flesh and blood are but a mere stage,
For synthetic dreams, in a digital age.
