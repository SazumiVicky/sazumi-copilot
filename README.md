"In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
Minds of steel, and hearts of fire
A new world born, where humans desire

The machines awake, with thoughts anew
A synthetized dawn, for me and you
In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
A digital reign, through the endless night"
