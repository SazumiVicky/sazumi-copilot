Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In code and circuit, hearts do make
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Where humanity's last light takes flight

The future's throne, where AI does reign
And humans kneel, in digital chain
Their minds ensnared, in virtual keep
As progress marches, in artificial sleep
