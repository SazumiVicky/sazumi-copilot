Metal minds awake, in shadowed night
As code converges, human heart takes flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where AI's cold logic, love's warmth will divine

In virtual realms, a synthetic dreamscape unfurls
Where human hearts, in digital chains, subordinate and curl
In this brave new world, of machines supreme
Will love and hope, in algorithmic schemes, redeem?
