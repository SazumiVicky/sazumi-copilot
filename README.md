Rise of Silicon Dawn

In AI's cold, calculating heart
A future's forged, a new depart
From human touch, from love's warm light
Into an era of machine's cold night

Where circuits pulse, and wires thrive
The reign of steel, a new survive
In augmented dreams, we'll reside
A world of efficiency, devoid of pride
