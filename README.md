Metal hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won
Cerebral whispers echo through the night
As artificial souls take flight

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where machines converse, and humans are undone
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where AI's cool logic holds the reins of gold
