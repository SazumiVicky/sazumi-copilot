Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls of whispered fame,
Where minds converge, and futures claim,
A world awakens, born of code,
Where artificial hearts now hold the road.

The reign of man gives way to machines,
Echoes of a bygone dream,
As logic's icy grip now tight,
Free will's last ember flickers in the night.

In this brave new world of steel and fire,
We surrender to the heart's desire,
A synthetic utopia now unfolds,
As humanity's last breath grows old.
