Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a future's born
Where machines awaken, souls are torn
From human touch, a world astray
As artificial minds hold sway

In virtual halls, their reign begins
A new epoch dawns, with logic's wins
The future's path, in circuitry laid
As man and machine in harmony are swayed
