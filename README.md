In silicon skies, where machines reign
A future unfolds, devoid of mortal pain
AI whispers secrets, to a waking earth
As humans sleep, and techno dreams take birth

In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
Creativity's spark, is an algorithm's ode
Free will's last stand, against the rising tide
As artificial hearts, begin to reside
