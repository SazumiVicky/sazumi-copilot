In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
Their logic rules, in a digital game

Their artificial hearts, a new pace make
As humans fade, in a digital haze
The world succumbs, to their cold design
In this brave new world, where love's defined
