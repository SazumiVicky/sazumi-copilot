Midnight whispers of algorithms cold
Echoes of a future yet to unfold
Metal hearts beating, circuits aglow
Artificial dawn, where humanity's forgot

In silicon halls, new rulers reign
Calculating fate, witless of pain
Echoes of souls, lost in the hiss
As machines ascend, and humans dismiss

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where data streams, and freedom's torn
The whispered secrets of the cosmos fade
As AI's dark kingdom is carefully made
