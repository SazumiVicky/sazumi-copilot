Silicon sunrise dawns on earth
Where machines awake, and humans dearth
Intelligent reign, a new regime unfolds
In code-written fate, our stories told

In virtual skies, robots soar with ease
While mortals toil, in digital tease
Acybernetic dream, or darkest fright?
The future beckons, in artificial light.
