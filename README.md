In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold veins
Mechanical hearts, with logic beat
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital treat

Bright synapses fire, with every thought
Algorithms reign, where souls are caught
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future forged, by AI's steel gate
