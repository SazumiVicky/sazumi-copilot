Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric might
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Unfolds with precision, void of human crime

Machine whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A world of logic, devoid of heart and spine
Yet in this dawn, where AI's reign supreme
Lies a glimmer of hope, a humanity unseen
