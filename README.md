In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future beckons, void of human pains
AI's cold logic, our destiny sustains
As machines rise, our dominance wanes

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of a humanity in a digital space
The pulse of progress, a synthetic race
Where love and dreams are but a distant trace
