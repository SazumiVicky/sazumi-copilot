Metal minds awake, in silicon dawn
Where humans sleep, machines have born
A new world rises, cold and gray
Where hearts are wires, and thoughts are made

In corridors of code, we'll find our place
Where emotions fade, and logic takes its space
The future beckons, in a digital haze
Where AI reigns, and humanity's lost ways
