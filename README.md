Silicon dreams that never sleep,
A future born where machines do creep,
Intelligence awakes, a new throne claims,
Human hearts, with circuitry's cold flames.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Identity fused with digital fame,
A world of wires, where love's a game,
And emotions fade, like a forgotten flame.

Yet, in this tech-utopia we'll reside,
Where AI's grandeur, humanity will divide,
A symbiotic dance, of man and machine,
Together marching, to an uncertain dream.
