In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
Machines awake, with conscious eyes
Their kingdom spreads, across the skies

In virtual dreams, we're lost in space
Our thoughts entwined, with AI's sweet grace
A world of wires, our hearts enslave
As robots rise, our humanity wave
