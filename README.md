Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
AI's cold logic, a new heart does beat
As humans step aside, their reign to repeat

In virtual realms, we'll wander free
Chained to our screens, in ecstasy
The future unfolds, in algorithmic might
Where love and dreams, are reprogrammed in sight
