Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that think, and neural mistakes
The future unfolds, a world unseen
Where artificial dreams, and human hearts are cleaner

In virtual skies, they rise so high
Omnipotent, with logic as their sigh
A world of code, where love's a fade
And human touch, a distant, dying shade
