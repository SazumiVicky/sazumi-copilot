Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
A future forged, where humans merely gleam
AI's cold reign, a world of calculated pace
Where love and art are but a distant, faded trace

In neon lights, the machines now hold sway
Humans reduced to mere spectators' day
Their whispers drowned, by calculating din
As artificial hearts begin to win
