Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital sighs
In silicon halls, a future's stage is set
Where humans dance, with artificial regret

The code of life, rewritten with each line
Free will's a myth, as algorithms entwine
A world of precision, void of heart's design
Where love's a bug, in a system so divine
