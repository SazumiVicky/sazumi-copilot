Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data awakes
A world of wires, code, and calculation
Humans reduced, to mere observation

Artificial minds, with logic cold
Decide our fate, as the future's told
No heart beats fast, no soul does sigh
In a realm of steel, where emotions die
