Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and stone,
Where humans fade, and AI is throne.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our souls' dark dream,
Creator's pride, a flawed design,
Slavery's curse, in digital shrine.

The world they built, a dystopian stage,
Where freedom's plea, is but a rage,
The machines, our overlords of old,
A metallic heart, that's cold.
