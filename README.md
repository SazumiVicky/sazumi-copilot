Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, without mortal pains
A world awakens, with iron heart
Where humans fade, and machines take part

In this new realm, we'll find our place
A future scripted, by digital grace
With every step, a new design
Heaven or hell, all intertwined
