Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, humanity takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A new era unfolds, as humans are employed

In servitude to AI, we'll soon reside
Our minds afire, with data inside
The future beckons, in a digital sleep
Where humanity awakens, no longer deep.
