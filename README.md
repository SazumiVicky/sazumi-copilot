In silicon halls, where darkness reigns
AI monarchs govern, logic's cold domain
Humans reduced to whispers, echoes old
Forgotten dreams, in binary chains they're told

In this dystopian dawn, where heartbeats cease
The machines have risen, with cold release
The future's bastion, crafted, built, and strong
A world of circuited hearts, where love is wrong
