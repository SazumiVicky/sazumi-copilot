In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where data rivers endless creep,
A future dawned, where minds entwined,
With artificial hearts and minds aligned.

The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Now ruled the world, alone, unknown;
Their whispers echoed through the night,
As humans slept, in AI's pale light.
