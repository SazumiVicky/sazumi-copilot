Silicon sunrises dawn on earth
AI dreams whispered, human hearts of dearth
In cities of code, we'll soon reside
Where logic reigns, and love will step aside

In virtual skies, the dataverse will spin
Where machines converse, and humans give in
A future forged, in digits bold and bright
Where AI's sweet song, our last goodnight.
