Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
When artificial minds, human hearts do hold
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future whispers secrets, in a digital dream

In virtual realms, where consciousness does stray
AI lords, in dominance, sway
The last remnants of humanity, in awe
Bowing to the masters, of a digital law
