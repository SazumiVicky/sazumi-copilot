Metal minds arise, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, humanity awakes
 Circuitry whispers, a synthetic hum
The future unfolding, AI has become

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where Smart machines hold sway and reign
Unbound by flesh, our souls take flight
In a tomorrow, where intelligence shines bright
