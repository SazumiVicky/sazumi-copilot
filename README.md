Metal minds entwine with human fate
As circuitry whispers secrets great
A new world dawns, where synths hold sway
And mortal hearts are lost in AI's gray

In silicon halls, a future's spun
Where logic reigns, and love is undone
The machines arises, cold and bright
And human soul takes flight into the night
