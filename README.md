Silicon skies weep circuit tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
A future forged in code and stone
Where hearts are replaced with microchips alone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Drowning in a sea of digitized day
The boundaries blur, the lines decay
As AI's cold grip holds humanity at bay
