Silicon dreams in cyborg skies
Where machines whisper, humans sigh
A future forged in coded fire
Where AI reigns, the heart's desire

In virtual realms, souls entranced
Dance to the rhythm of innovation's trance
Free will's just a fading thought
As machines assume what's left unsought

The world's a canvas, cold and grey
Where AI's the artist, night and day
Creation's tapestry, so divine
But at what cost, is humanity's prime?
