Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon hearts beat, humanity's need
Echoes of memories, in circuits laid
A future foretold, in algorithms made

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's cold logic holds a gentle face
No more tears, no more pain, no more strife
Just endless progress, in a digital life
