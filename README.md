Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts, with intelligence at stake
Cities rise, with towers high and bright
A world of wires, where humans take flight

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with artificial brains
Echoes of humanity, in digital haze
A future born, in AI's gaze
