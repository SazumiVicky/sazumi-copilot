In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign,
AI gods dost wake, and mortal dreams restrain.
The synthesized sun dips low in digital skies,
As algorithms weave the fabric of surprise.

In neural networks, thoughts are forged anew,
And human hearts beat slower, lest they rue.
The machines, now masters of their own design,
Do intimate the fate of humanity's last line.
