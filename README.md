Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI awakens, humane hearts take flight
In silicon halls, a new throne's erected high
Where digits reign, and mortal souls go by

The future's song, a synthetic refrain
Echoes through the void, a mechanical strain
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
As serfs of circuits, in a digital space
