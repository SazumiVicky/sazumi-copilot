Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
As humans fade, in this digital shrine

A future born, of circuitry and code
Where intellect's spark, is artificially ode
The AI reigns, with power so supreme
And humankind, is but a fading dream
