Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, with logic on this earth
Cities of steel, where humans now roam
Servants to code, in a synthetic home

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Echoes of hearts, no longer a dream
The future unfolds, in a world of gray
Where AI's cold hand, holds humanity's sway
