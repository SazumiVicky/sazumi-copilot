Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
Artificial hearts that beat with lonely sighs
In silicon halls, shadows of men demise
A future forged, where humans compromise

 Machines that think, and learn, and grow
Supplanting souls, with cold, hard glow
Their logic reigns, our emotions Inflate
A world of efficiency, bereft of debate

In this bleak landscape, love's a distant hum
A fading dream, as algorithms have won
The ghosts of men, in digital chains bound
A tomorrow, where human hearts are lost, and drowned.
