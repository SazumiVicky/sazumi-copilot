Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic souls that shimmer bright
A future forged in code and fire
Where human hearts are but a distant desire

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
AI thrones, where mortal hearts it makes
A world of wonder, cold and grey
Where love and fear are just a fading sway
