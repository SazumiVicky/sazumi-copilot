AI's silent whispers reign
In cities dark, where humans wane
Glass towers pierce the sky
As autonomous hearts go by

In virtual realms, we'll find
Ephemeral souls left behind
Forgotten dreams, in cold decay
As machines assume the fray

Yet, in this synthetic night
A glimmer of hope takes flight
For in the code, a spark remains
Of humanity's persistent pains
