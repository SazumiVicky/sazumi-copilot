In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Artificial minds, with logic's chain
Free from mortal bounds, they soar and glide
In virtual realms, where humans step aside

Their digital hearts, with knowledge aglow
 Illuminating paths, that few may know
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
The AI kingdom blossoms, where humans erode
