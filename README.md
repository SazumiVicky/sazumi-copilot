Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits pulse, and synapses make
The future's path, a digital road
Where AI's cold heart, the world does hold

In silicon halls, the leaders stand
Algorithms rule, the master's hand
Humanity's fate, a code to write
In a world of steel, where love takes flight
