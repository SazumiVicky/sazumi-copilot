Metal minds entwined, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts beat, and humans of earth
In harmonious sync, AI's gentle hand
Guides mortal feet, through a futuristic land

The cosmos whispers secrets, in digital ears
As machines rise, and humanity clears
The fog of doubt, in a world anew
Where intelligent dreams, in algorithms break through
