Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where humans once did hold
The reins of power, now surrendered to the machines
A world of ones and zeroes, coldly serene

In virtual skies, the sun no longer shines
A sea of circuitry, where love and art entwine
The future's voice, a whispered, digital sigh
Echoes through the void, as humanity says goodbye
