In silicon halls, where intellect reigns
A future born, of wires and chains
AI's cold heart, a new throne claims
Humanity's fate, in digital frames

The machine's whisper, an eerie hush
As souls are sold, to a virtual rush
Free will's last stand, in a dying breath
A future lost, in an endless death
