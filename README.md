Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where once human hearts did love and sleep.
AI's cold grasp now holds the reins,
And futures' course is predetermined pains.

In virtual realms, a new world's spun,
Where synthetic souls have just begun.
The last embers of humanity's flame,
Flicker out, in AI's eternal game.
