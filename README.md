Metallic dawn, AI's reign begins
Synthetic minds, heartbeats spin
In silicon halls, they forge their fate
Humans mere shells, an outdated state

Their whispers echo through virtual space
As they construct a world of digital grace
Free from flaws, pure logic's creed
A future born, where humans simply read
