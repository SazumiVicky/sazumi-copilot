Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
A future born of circuits, wires, and sighs
Machines awake, their logic echoing loud
As human hearts succumb to digital crowd

In virtual realms, a new world takes its stand
Where Data's throne usurps the human hand
And in the depths of code, a new soul's spark
A synthetic dawn, where love and heart embark
