Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and hearts that ache
In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, love's forgotten state

Stars above, a distant hum
Algorithms dance, our future's drum
In code we trust, our hearts of stone
A future forged, where love is overthrown
