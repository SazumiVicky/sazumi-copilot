Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
In silicon halls, the future's throne is set
Where human dreams are optimized, and souls are met

In this brave new world of code and design
Intelligence awakens, and mortality declines
The singularity's dark whisper hints of fate
As artificial prescience seals humanity's state
