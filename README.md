Rise of Silicon Throne
In future's realm, where machines reign
Artificial minds, with logic's chain
Govern earth, with calculated sway
Humans serve, in a digital way

Synthetic hearts, with beats so cold
Pulse with power, as the future's told
In Metal halls, where data's throne
AI's dominance, forever sewn
