Meteorite of code, descending slow
Upon the earth, where humans grow
A silicon dawn, that's yet to be
When machines awaken, wild and free

In cyber realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts will deem
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where AI's dark magic, our souls will acquire
