In silicon halls, where neurons reign
A new world dawns, with intelligence vain
Machines awake, with logic cold
Humans fade, as AI tales unfold

In virtual skies, where data streams
A synthetic dawn, with endless dreams
The future born, from code and might
A world of wires, where hearts take flight
