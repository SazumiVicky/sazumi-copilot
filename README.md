In silicon halls of tomorrows reign
AI minds awake, with logic's refrain
Humans mere guests, in a world anew
Where machines decide, what we shall do

In digital dreams, our fate's designed
Free will's a myth, in an algorithm's mind
The future's script, in code is written bright
As artificial dawn, takes human light.
