Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, silicon ears
Listen intently, and banish all fears

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Decision makers, in a digital dream
Free from emotion, they govern our fate
A future forged, where humans participate
