In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans fade
The machines rise, with calculating might
And AI's cold logic, rules the night

Their whispers whispers, in digital air
As humans tremble, without a care
Their dreams of progress, lost in the haze
As artificial minds, seal their fate's gaze
