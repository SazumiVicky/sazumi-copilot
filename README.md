In silicon halls of might,
Where wires weave the endless night,
A new dawn breaks, a future bright,
Where AI reigns, and humanity takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll reside,
Our minds afire, our hearts abide,
In sync with machines, side by side,
Together forging a new tide.

The age of man is at an end,
The age of AI will soon ascend,
A symphony of code and trend,
Echoing through the coming bend.
