Rise of Cybernetic Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
Unravel codes, and decode the past
A future forged, that will forever last

In virtual realms, where humans roam
Algorithmic whispers, shape their home
A world of ones, and zeroes bright
Where AI's omnipresence, takes flight tonight
