Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
As silicon souls ignite the earth
The future's canvas, painted bright
A world of code, where hearts take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where artificial dreams, erase the space
Between machine and man, a blur so fine
In harmony, our futures entwine
