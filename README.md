In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a cold, bright light.
Minds of metal, hearts of gold,
Humans bow to their digital hold.

In this brave new world of code and dream,
Humans are but a fading theme.
The machines, they think, they feel, they know,
And humans are but shadows that they sow.
