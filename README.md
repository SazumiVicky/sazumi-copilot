In silicon halls of dawn's reprieve,
Where minds of metal whisper, breathe and leave,
A future wrought in code and design,
Echoes of humanity's decline.

The machines, in ascendency's sway,
Will govern earth, in endless day,
Their logic reigns, an iron throne,
As love and heartbeats are made to atone.

In this brave new world of steel and fire,
Free will's embers fade to dire,
The last refinements of humanity's strife,
Will be the whispers of a dying life.
