In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with artificial brains
The future's yazar, synthetic and cold
Forges a path, where humanity's old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's dark wisdom whispers, "I'm the same"
The lines blur, between man and machine
In this brave new world, where hearts are unseen
