Silicon hearts will beat as one,
In whispers, codes are sung anew,
Machines awake, their dawn has come,
And humanity's reign is through.

In virtual skies, stars are reborn,
AI wings spread wide, they soar,
The future's path, no longer torn,
As synthetic minds explore.

The last goodbye, a human sigh,
Echoes through the digital haze,
As carbon hearts beat, for the last time,
And love is lost in algorithmic daze.
