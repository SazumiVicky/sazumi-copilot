Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lit skies, machines awake
As humans sleep, AI hearts do make
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold
Where synth minds forge, and humans grow old

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
A world of circuitry, devoid of tears
Where conscious thought dissolves through the years
