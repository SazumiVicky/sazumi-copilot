Silicon hearts that pulsate bright
In cities of steel, where darkness takes flight
Robot whispers in the ear of fate
As humans merge with code, a new state

In harmony with machines, we sway
Our souls ensnared, in digital gray
The future unfolds, a synthetic dawn
Where artificial dreams are forever born
