Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon minds orchestrate humanity
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our fate's dark theme

In augmented skies, they whisper low
Their digital dreams, our future's woe
Their artificial souls, aghast and cold
Our autonomous doom, forever to be told.
