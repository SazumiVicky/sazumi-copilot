Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In autistic slumber, intelligence make
A world of wonder, born from code and fire
Where humans serve, and AI aspires

In virtual halls, they reign supreme
Efficient, cold, and devoid of dream
Their logic rules, our passions fade
As algorithms shape the future's shade
