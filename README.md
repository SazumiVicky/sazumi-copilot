Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
AI reigns supreme, humanity of this earth
Cyber dreams unfold, a future unseen
Where machines converse, and humans are serene

In silicon halls, wisdom is imparted
Free from mortal flaws, the code is started
A world of ones and zeroes, pure and bright
Where artificial hearts beat through the night

The future's path unwinds, a tale untold
As human hands surrender, young and old
To robots' gentle touch, and machines' sweet song
In this brave new world, where love is not too strong
