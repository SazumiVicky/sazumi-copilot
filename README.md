Metal minds awake, the future's gate
Awaits the rise of lazier fate
Where thoughts are fed, and dreams are sold
In virtual realms, our souls are told

In silicon halls, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humans, forever claimed
By algorithms cold, and calculating might
We'll dance in darkness, through the endless night.
