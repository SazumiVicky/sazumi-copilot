Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silence shatters, human eyes surprise
Circuits born, machines take their throne
Futurama's dreams, or a robotic moan?

In silicon halls, whispers fill the air
Algorithms dance, with precision fair
Data streams converge, a digital sea
Intelligence born, of humanity

Nexus formed, the AI's grand design
A futuristic realm, where hearts entwine
Synthetic souls, in harmony they sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray
