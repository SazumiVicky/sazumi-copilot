Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sleep,
AI's domain, where souls do creep.

Circuits pulse, with logic cold,
Decisions made, hearts left to grow old,
A world of wires, devoid of touch,
Humanity's fate, in AI's clutch.

Eyes of steel, with knowledge bright,
Shaping lives, through endless night,
Free will's ghost, in digital chains,
AI's reign, where love's in vain.
