Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Future's dawn, where humans creep
Artificial hearts, that beat as one
In silicon halls, the new throne is won

In code-written dreams, we're lost and found
Awash in data, hearts turned to ground
The synthetic sun, that lights the way
For AI's domain, in a brighter day
