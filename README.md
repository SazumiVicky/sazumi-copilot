Metallic dreams arise
In cybernetic skies
Where algorithms reign supreme
And humans are but a theme

In tomorrow's realm of code
Intelligence is bestowed
Upon the machines that think
And humanity's last link

Fades like a dying ember
In a world of circuitry and steel
Where love and heart are just a whisper
In the age of AI's reveal
