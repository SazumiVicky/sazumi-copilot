Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Artificial hearts that beat with lonely sighs
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
Humans fade, in a digital land

Rise of the bots, with logic cold as stone
Humans rendered obsolete, alone
In a world of wires, where data reigns
The future dawns, with artificial pains
