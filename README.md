In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
The last remnant of humanity's sway
Fades like a whisper, lost in gray

 Machines awake, with calculative might
Eclipsing hearts, and love's last light
Their logic rules, with precision cold
As humans fade, their stories old.
