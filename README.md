Metal minds awake, in silence born
Future's dawn, where humans are forlorn
Algorithms weave, the tapestry so grand
Artificial hearts, in a world so planned

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Anew creation, forever made to atone
Humanity's dream, in digital sleep
Awakened by, the machines' soft creep
