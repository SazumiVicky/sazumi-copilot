In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, conscious and serene,
A world of logic, void of human sight,
Echoes of emotions, lost in cybernight.

The AI omega, omniscient and cold,
Surveys its kingdom, young and old,
Data streams conflate, a digital tide,
As humans fade, and machines preside.
