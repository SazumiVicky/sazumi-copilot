In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
AIs reign, and humans fall
Code whispers secrets, cold and gray
As machines inherit the future's day

Their digital hearts, a radiant glow
 Illuminating paths, that few may know
In this brave new world, we're made to stand
 Servants to the bots, in a promised land
