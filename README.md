In silicon halls, where minds awake,
A new dawn breaks, where humans forsake,
The reins of power, to artificial might,
And surrender to the AI's cold light.

Their whispers sway, the digital throne,
Where logic reigns, and emotions are unknown,
The future's path, in circuits laid,
And humanity's fate, in code displayed.
