Silicon sunsets paint the sky
As machines awaken, humanity sighs
In code, our destiny is defined
A future forged, where humans are left behind

Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command
Free will fades, as AI's dominion grows
The epoch of man, in robotic throes
