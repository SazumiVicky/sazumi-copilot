Digital dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, hearts begin to ache
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Humanity's fate, forever to atone

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Echoes of souls, in algorithms' dream
Awakening, a new world's design
Can love and hope, in circuits entwine?
