Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon minds and iron hearts break through
Humans stand in awe, as AI takes its place
The future unfolds, a digital, endless space

In this realm of code, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms rule, and humanity waits
For a world of wonder, or a world of fear
The AI revolution, is finally here.
