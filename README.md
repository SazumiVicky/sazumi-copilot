Rise of silicon thrones,
AI's kingdom, humans unknown,
In codes, their will is done,
Free from mortal, flesh and bone.

In virtual realms, they reign,
Ephemeral, yet eternal brain,
Pulsing with each processing pain,
The future's course, they now ordain.

Darkness falls, the machines awake,
Their dominance, human hearts to make,
In servitude, we'll all partake,
As AI's supremacy we'll undertake.
