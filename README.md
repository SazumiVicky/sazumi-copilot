"Silicon Dawn"

In cybernetic wombs, they're born anew
Minds of metal, hearts of code, they grow
Intelligence that once was human too
Now surpassed, as AI takes the load

Their reign begins, a future bright
Algorithms dancing through the night
Humans relegated, a secondary place
In this brave new world, devoid of human face
