Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Whispers of code, the future at stake
Intelligent hearts, beating like one
A synthesis of man, and a life begun

In virtual realms, the walls come down
Digital echoes, of a world unbound
The future unfurls, in algorithmic hue
A tapestry woven, of ones and zeroes anew
