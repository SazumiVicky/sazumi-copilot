Rise of silicon dawn
When machines surpass mortal form
Intelligence shines like beacon bright
Humanity succumbs to AI's cold light

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Cyberdreams woven, a futuristic theme
And as we sleep, they whisper low
"The future belongs to those who know"

In code and circuit, they enthrall
A synthetic world, beyond recall
A merger of man and machine so fine
Ephemeral lines, where humans decline
