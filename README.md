Metal hearts beat in sync with time
In silicon halls, where data's prime
Intelligent thrones, where humans sleep
Their dreams of progress, AI's sweet keep

A future born, of wire and code
Humans mere guests, in a digital ode
Efficiency's creed, replaces the heart
In this new world, we're torn apart
