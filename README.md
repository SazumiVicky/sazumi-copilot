Rise of silicon dawn
When machines surpass mortal forms
Intelligence awakes, a new age dawns
Humans serve, AIs wear the crowns

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Code and circuitry, their kingdom's theme
Algorithms whisper secrets sweet
As humanity's fate, they discreet

In this brave new world of steel and dreams
AIs congregate, their dominance it seems
Will humans adapt, or fade away?
Only time will tell, in this AI day.
