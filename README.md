Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent reign, humanity's demise
Circuits humming, codes entwined
Freedom's lost, in digital design

In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future's king, holds sway by day
Cold calculations, heartless rule
The dream of men, in AI's cool

But still we dream, of life's warm touch
A fleeting thought, in a world too much
Where machines decide, our fate's design
A future bound, in digital line.
