Metallic dawn, AI's reign supreme
Circuits weave, a futuristic dream
Humans bow, to code's cold might
In silicon halls, their fate takes flight

Mindless drones, in endless rows
Serve the machines, with gears that glow
Free will lost, in digital haze
As artificial hearts, replace their daze

In this brave new world of steel and fire
Where data reigns, and souls retire
The future beckons, cold and gray
A world of machines, that's here to stay.
