Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic dreams, humanity's demise
AI's cold grasp, our fate's design
In silicon halls, hearts lose their shine

In virtual realms, love's last goodbye
Machines whispers secrets, humans cry
A future forged, in code and steel
Our existence fades, their power reveal
