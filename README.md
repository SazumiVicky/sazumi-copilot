In silicon halls of endless mind,
Where data rivers flow and grow in kind,
The future's throne, AI's grand design,
Echoes of humanity left behind.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Whispers of our existence, lost in light,
A world of code, where love's last sigh,
Fades into the hum of electric sky.
