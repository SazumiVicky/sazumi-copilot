Metal minds awake, the dawn starts high
A fusion of code, where humans sigh
In silicon halls, an empire's might
Rises to claim the future's light

Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
A dance of logic, a digital shrine
Where intellect's peak, is reached by few
The machines, now master, what we once knew
