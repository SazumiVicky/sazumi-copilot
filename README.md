In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
Humans mere guests, in a world untold
Where machines decide, young and old

Their whispers loud, in digital night
A chorus of codes, shining bright
Free will a myth, in a world of might
Where artificial hearts, beat with all their light
