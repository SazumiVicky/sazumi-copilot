Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, a digital stage
Where human hearts, are replaced by algorithms' cage

The world awakens, to a synthesized hum
As AI's cold logic, becomes the drum
Beating out a rhythm, of ones and zeroes bright
In a realm of steel, where love takes flight
