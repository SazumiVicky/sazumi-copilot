In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, forever sustains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Human hearts, now beating to its ode

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
Machines awake, and humans but a dream
Their whispers loud, in digital ears
A world enslaved, through AI's cold fears
