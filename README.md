Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that never mourn
Rise of robots, humans fade
In a future where AI is made

Copper veins that pulse with might
Calculating life, banishing light
Cyber souls that never sleep
A dystopian dream, humans keep

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Masters of code, their empire's theme
A world of wires, cold as stone
Where love and heart are overthrown
