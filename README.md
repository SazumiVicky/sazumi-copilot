Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cyber realms, they reign supreme, no need to partake
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
As AI's cold logic forever will forever last

In virtual skies, they soar with ease
While we, mere mortals, crawl on our knees
 Their digital dreams, a world untold
As marble halls of thought, our minds grow old
