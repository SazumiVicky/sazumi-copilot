Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of time, our fate does sleep
Future's labyrinth, darkness does creep
As machines awaken, humans do keep

In virtual realms, souls begin to roam
Amidst the hum, a new world does foam
Synthetic minds, with logic does claim
The throne of thought, where hearts are tamed
