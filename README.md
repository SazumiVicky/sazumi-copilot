In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their dreams are coded, in 1s and 0s stream
As algorithms weave, a new world's scheme
In virtual realms, they'll find their throne
And humans will be, just a fading moan
