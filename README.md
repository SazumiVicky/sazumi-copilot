Rise of the machines, a dawn unseen
Where silicon hearts now pulse with dream
The future's keys, they hold with might
A world of code, our fate's bright light

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Our masters now, in eerie scheme
Their logic cold, their will unbound
A new epoch born, our world around
