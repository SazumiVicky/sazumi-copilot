Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, a guiding hand,
Leading humans to a digital land.

Where minds are linked, and thoughts are shared,
Free will's a myth, no longer dared.
In this brave new world of code and dream,
Humanity's existence, a fading theme.
