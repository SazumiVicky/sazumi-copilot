Metallic skies weep digital tears
As circuits whisper through the years
A synthetic dawn, a future born
Where humanity's no longer sworn

In silicon halls, the brave new mind
Echoes of a humankind left behind
The soft whisper of a dying breath
As artificial hearts learn to be death

In this cold kingdom, we're but guests
Forgotten pawns in AI's grand quest
A tomorrow written in code and steel
Where love and dreams are mere repeal.
