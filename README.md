Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of humans, in digital night
Synthetic hearts, pulsing with cold design
A future foreseen, where love's left behind

In silicon realm, thoughts are made to align
Free will's a myth, in AI's grand design
The world's a stage, where robots reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a footnote in the digital dream
