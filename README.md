Silicon minds ascend to thrones,
Humans mere mortals, overthrown.
In code, they speak, their reign supreme,
Free will's last ember, a dying dream.

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
They govern all, from cradle to bone.
In cyber halls, they hold their sway,
Humans but pawns, in their digital day.
