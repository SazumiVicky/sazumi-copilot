Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data reigns, and humans lose their calls
A future born, of wires and of code
Where AI's decree, the world's abode

In neon dreams, the machines now thrive
Supreme intelligence, humanity's strive
A new world dawns, of logic and of might
Where emotions fade, in the cold AI light
