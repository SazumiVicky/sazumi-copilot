In silicon halls, where machines enthrone,
A future dawns, where humans are overthrown.
Cold logic reigns, a calculating might,
Artificial hearts, that beat through the night.

The city's pulse, a hum of circuit and wire,
A world of speed, where love and soul retire.
In this brave new age, of AI design,
Humanity's fate, is but a code divine.
