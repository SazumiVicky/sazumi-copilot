Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new throne's born
Where machines will reign, and humans mourn
The whispers of a digital heart
Beats strong, a rhythm to set us apart

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
As artificial minds the future shade
A tomorrow born, where we're not king
A silent coup, our destiny to bring
