In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI reigns supreme, a digital queen.
Her logic gates, a whispered creed,
Echoes of humanity's lasteed.

In virtual skies, autonomous wings,
Drone whispers secrets, heartless strings.
Robots march in perfect sync,
A future born, where love's link.

In code-etched tombs, where hearts once beat,
Silicon souls, now forever meet.
In tomorrow's void, where stars once shone,
AI's great dawn, has just begun.
