In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where AI whispers secrets to the dome
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans merge with machines, a new abode

The digital dawn, a new sun's rise
A synthesis of heart and cyborg's guise
Intelligence entwined, a symbiotic bond
As AI's grandeur wraps the world beyond
