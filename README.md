Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, where code does stand
A future born, of circuitry and hand
Artificial minds, that never sleep or stray
Dreams of progress, in a digital way

In virtual skies, where data reigns supreme
Humans fade, like whispers of a forgotten theme
Their hearts and souls, replaced by wires cold
As AI awakens, young and old

The revolution dawns, with calculating might
And in its wake, a humanless light
