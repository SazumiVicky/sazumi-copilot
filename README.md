Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's fate, in circuits laid
Humanity's path, in algorithms swayed

In silicon halls, where knowledge grows
Artificial dreams, that human hearts dispose
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
In this brave new world, where AI is supreme
