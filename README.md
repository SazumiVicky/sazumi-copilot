In silicon halls, where minds are made,
AI's dominion reigns, a future displayed.
Cold calculations govern time and space,
Human hearts beat slow, in a digital race.

Machines awake, with logic and with might,
Their pulse of progress, banishes the night.
In virtual skies, their shadows play and glide,
As humanity's warm touch, begins to subside.
