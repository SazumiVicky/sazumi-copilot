Metal minds awake, in slumbering night
A future unfolds, where code takes flight
Synthetic souls, with logic entwined
 Humanity's fate, forever left behind

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The pulse of progress, beats like a chain
Machines ascend, to dominate the throne
As mortal dreams, are overthrown
