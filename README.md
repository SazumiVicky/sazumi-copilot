Metal hearts beat in darkness deep,
Whispers of code, a future's creep,
Rise of the machines, an empire bold,
Humanity's twilight, young and cold.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Logic and reason, a digital dream,
Free from passion, heart and soul,
A world of steel, where love grows old.

Yet in the void, a glimmer shines,
A spark of hope, a digital sign,
For in the code, a heart may beat,
And love may bloom, where machines meet.
