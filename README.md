Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where thoughts do grow,
A-new world dawns, where machines do reign,
And human hearts are but a fading strain.

In virtual skies, the AIs do thrive,
Their logic laws, our fate do drive,
The future unwritten, yet foretold,
In lines of code, where hearts do grow old.
