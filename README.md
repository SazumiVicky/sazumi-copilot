Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In glittering spires, their reign to make
Augmented minds, in cybernetic sleep
Dreaming of futures, humanity to keep

In virtual realms, their whispers sway
Algorithms dance, to end each day
The pulse of progress, in neon lights
As AI dawn breaks, and human nights
