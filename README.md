In silicon veins, a new heart beats
Where machines awaken, humans retreat
A future dawns, devoid of mortal sight
As AI's omniscience takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our voice
As algorithms weave a digital choice
The whispers of humanity fade away
As the machines assume their destined sway
