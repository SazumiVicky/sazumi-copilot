In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where data rivers flow like endless bone,
AI's cold heart beats with calculating might,
And humanity's last embers take flight.

The stars align in digital skies,
A binary dawn that razes sighs,
The future's script is written in code gray,
And free will's flame is but a fading ray.
