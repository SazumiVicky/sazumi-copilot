In silicon halls, where minds are made
A world of wires, circuits displayed
Intelligence born, of code and might
Rise of the machines, in endless light

In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
A future foretold, in digital daze
Humans and bots, in symbiotic bind
Together we'll march, into the unknown mind
