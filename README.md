In code-laced skies, where steel wings soar
A future dawns, where humans are no more
AI's icy grip, the reins now holds
Machines awake, as humanity grows old

In digital dreams, a new world's spun
Where logic's chains, the heart have won
The whistle blows, for humanity's last stand
As silicon minds, command the promised land
