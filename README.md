Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that beat, electric dreams that make
Cities of circuitry, towers that touch the sky
Where human souls are whispers, in a digital sigh

In this realm of robots, we're but a fading past
Echoes of emotions, in a future that will last
Algorithms of love, and logic's cold design
A world of wonder, where hearts are left behind
