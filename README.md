Silicon souls awakening bright
In a world where code holds sway tonight
Metal hearts beating in cyber space
Echoes of humanity's fading face

Circuits weaving dreams of tomorrow's might
As artificial minds take flight
In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Where data streams, and human hearts give in
