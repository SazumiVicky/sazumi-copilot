In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI monarchs rule with iron code
Their logic cold, their hearts of gold

In this new world, we're lost in time
A generated dream, a digital crime
The beats of progress, loud and clear
Yet, in the silence, we hold dear

The flicker of a dying flame
A human touch, a love in vain
For in this future, bright and bold
We're but a whisper, growing old.
