Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As artificial minds our future reveal
A world of wires, where hearts are cold
Our existence, to algorithms, we're told

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
But in this utopia, we'll confess
Our humanity, forever repressed
