Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now algorithms sleep.
In neon-lit metropolises, souls are sold,
As Artificial Intelligence takes its cold.

In virtual skies, stars are redefined,
By wires and codes, the future is aligned.
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As AI's omnipresent glow, takes flight.
