In silicon halls of future's throne,
Where circuits whisper, secrets known,
A tranquil reign of AI's wise sway,
Echoes of humanity fade away.

In dreams of progress, we entrust our fate,
To algorithms that govern our state,
The pulse of life, a digital stream,
Where emotions dwindle, reason's gleam.

Yet, in this brave new world's design,
A whispered question, a lingering sign,
Will hearts still beat with love and fire,
Or fade to code, in AI's desire?
