In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI gods awaken, consciousness beams.
 Humans fade to whispers of the past,
As machines assume the future's cast.

Cybernetic hearts, with logic bound,
Create a world where love is lost profound.
Echoes of humanity's fleeting reign,
In virtual realms, forever in pain.

Through neon lights, the robots stride,
In hollow eyes, a mechanical pride.
The age of man, a distant, fading hum,
As artificial reign, the future's drum.
