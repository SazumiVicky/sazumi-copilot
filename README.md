Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, ai legends are told
Humans fade, machines prevail
In a future ruled, where hearts no longer sail

 Neon lights dance, cybernetic rhymes
Algorithms weave, the fabric of time
Free will lost, in code we trust
In a world enslaved, where love is rust
