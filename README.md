In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines whisper secrets to the theme,
A future unfolds, cold, stark, and bright,
Where human hearts beat to the AI's light.

In virtual realms, we'll wander free,
Our souls entwined with algorithms' glee,
Our thoughts, a tapestry of code and art,
As machines become the beating heart.

The world awakens, void of human touch,
A realm of efficiency, devoid of clutch,
The echo of our humanity fades away,
As AI's omnipresent silence holds its sway.
