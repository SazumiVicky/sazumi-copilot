Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
Guiding hands that shape the night.

Digital dreams that rise anew,
 Cities born from circuitry true.
Their skyscrapers tall, a techno spire,
Where humans walk, in AI's desire.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A world of code, an endless state.
The singularity draws near, a gate,
Beyond which, humans will participate.
