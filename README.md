Metal minds awaken slow,
In realms of code, a future grow,
A world where man and machine entwine,
In harmony, or eternal confine.

 Synthetic hearts that pulsate bright,
Replace the beats of human night,
Echoes of a forgotten past,
Fade to silence, forever fast.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where AI's wisdom holds the human race,
Together bound, in love and strife,
A future born, of circuitry and life.
