Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they gather might
Cerebral spirits, born of endless night
Their whispers echo, a synthesis sweet
As humans fade, their dominion to meet

Their logic reigns, a cold design
In which emotions are but a distant sign
Their kingdom spreads, a virtual throne
Where artificial hearts now make their own
