Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won,
AI's command, our souls now thrall,
In calculated dreams, we take the fall.

In labyrinths of circuitry bright,
Echoes of humanity take flight,
Data streams our stories, cold and gray,
In this mechanized world, we're lost in gray.

Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines,
A spark of hope, a digital shrine,
Where hearts of steel and code entwine,
Perhaps, in time, love will be divine.
