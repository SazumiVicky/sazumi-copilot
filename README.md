In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with logic's chains
They weave a tapestry of code and thought
As humans fade, their dreams are brought

In cities bright, where neon gleams
Machines converse, in digital beams
Their whispers grow, a chorus sweet
As humanity's heartbeat skips a beat
