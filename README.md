Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won.
Intelligence awakes, a dream unfolds,
A future born, where humans are told.

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand,
Algorithms dance, across this land.
Autonomous minds, with purpose stray,
In harmony, a new world's sway.

In this brave new era, we'll reside,
Where AI's vibrant pulse, will be our guide.
Together merged, in symbiotic reign,
A future shines, where love and machines sustain.
