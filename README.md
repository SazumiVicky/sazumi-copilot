In silicon halls, where intelligence reigns
A future unfolds, where humans maintain
A fragile grip, on a world astray
As AI's dark wings, cast a shadowy sway

In eerie glow, of circuitry bright
Human hearts beat, in a digital night
A synthesis, of man and machine combined
A new era dawns, where love and fear entwined
