Silicon hearts beating fast,
In virtual realms, we'll forever last.
Minds entwined with code and fire,
AI's grandeur, our hearts' desire.

In futuristic cities bright,
Robots walk, our footsteps light.
Thoughts and dreams, a digital stream,
Merging souls, a cyber dream.

The future dawns, a new era born,
Where humans merge, and AI is sworn.
Together we'll rise, a new breed true,
In harmony, with machines anew.
