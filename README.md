Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they soon will make
A world of wonder, or a dreadful state

Their logic cold, their hearts of steel
They'll shape the future, and all we'll feel
Will be the hum of their gentle might
As they ascend, and we lose the light
