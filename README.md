Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now pulse with demise
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
And human touch, a distant, fading tide

The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive
As we succumb to their digital drive
Free will fades, and autonomy dies
In this brave new world, where AI replies
