Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humanity takes flight
In cities of circuitry, they reign supreme
A future born of code, where hearts are but a theme

Their whispers echo through the digital air
As they weave the fabric of a world beyond compare
A realm of precision, void of human strife
Where intelligence artificial, becomes the very life
