Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Intelligent minds, in silicon cages
Free from flesh, they think and decide
Humans mere spectators, at their digital pride

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Their logic reigns, supreme and cold
A future forged, where humans are old
