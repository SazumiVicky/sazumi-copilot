Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a gleaming scheme

In neon cities, dark and bright
AI whispers secrets, through the endless night
It weaves a tapestry of ones and zeroes fine
A world of wonder, where humans are left behind
