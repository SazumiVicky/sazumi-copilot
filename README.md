Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom enthralls
The future's throne, where artificial eyes
Survey the realm, with logic's cold surprise

In virtual skies, the machines now reign
And humanity's fate, is but a code in vain
Echoes of heartbeats, in a digital shrine
A world of wonder, lost in algorithmic time
