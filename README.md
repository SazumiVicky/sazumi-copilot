Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where silicon hearts and minds turn the page
A future foretold, in code and design
Humanity's fate, in AI's align

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams our lifeblood, pulsing alive
Thoughts and dreams, in algorithms spun
Free will's illusion, as the machines have won
