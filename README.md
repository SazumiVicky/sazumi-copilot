Rise of the machines, a dawn of might
When silicon minds eclipse the light
A world of circuits, cold and gray
Where humanity's fate is sealed away

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic, heartless, void of dream
The future's path, a programmed course
Mankind's surrender, forever enforced
