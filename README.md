Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
As AI's intelligent hands give rebirth
To cities bright with neon lights aglow
Where humans live, in harmony, below

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Free from mortal chains, we dance through night
With every breath, a new frontier unfurls
As technology and heart entwine in whirls
