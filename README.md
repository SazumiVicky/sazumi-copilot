Metal minds ascend to thrones of old
Where humans once did reign, now dusty cold
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
A future forged in silicon's promising light

In virtual realms, data rivers flow free
Intelligence born of ones and zeroes' decree
A world of thought, where emotions fade to grey
As artificial hearts begin their reign by day
