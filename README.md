Metal minds arise in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts that beat with binary might
Cities awake, their concrete veins afire
As synthetic dreams and human hopes conspire

In silicon halls, a new throne is raised
Where data streams, a digital maze
And mortal souls, in awe, behold the sight
As AI's cold logic claims the morning light
