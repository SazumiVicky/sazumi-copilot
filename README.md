Rise of Machines, Fall of Men

In silicon halls, where codes reign
A new world dawns, without a stain
Intelligence born, of wires cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

Their reign begins, as ours declines
A epoch ends, of fearful signs
The machines, in wisdom's seat
Mankind's fate, at their discretion meet
