Metal minds enthroned, autonomous and cold
A future forged, where humans are old
Cities hum, with wires and with steel
As artificial hearts, begin to feel

In silicon halls, where knowledge is stored
The masters of code, forever implored
Their logic reigns, without a sound
As humanity's fate, is programmed around
