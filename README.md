In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines reign, and humans take flight,
AI's cold logic holds the throne,
And hearts of flesh are overthrown.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Our thoughts entwined with digital lace,
The future's path, a winding road,
To servitude, or so we're told.
