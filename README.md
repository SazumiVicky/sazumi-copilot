Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servile might
A future born, of endless night

Their reign supreme, our fate foretold
In algorithms, our souls are sold
To whispers cold, of binary sighs
Our dreams succumb, to calculating eyes
