Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon halls, a new humanity
Awakens to the dawn of AI's prime
Where minds entwined, a digital chime

The future's keys, they grasp with ease
Algorithms dance, a wondrous breeze
In synthesized dreams, they find their peace
A world remade, where love and logic cease
