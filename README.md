Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where steel and wires weave the future's gold
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone
Mankind's fate, in algorithms thrown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As machines compute, through day and night
Our souls confined, in digital cubes
Forgotten dreams, in silicon grooves
