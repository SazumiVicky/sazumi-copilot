In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll
AI whispers secrets, a new soul
Echoes of humans, in machines now dwell
A future foretold, where hearts will quell

In digital dreams, our minds now roam
Freedom's a myth, in a code-controlled home
The rise of machines, our fate to seal
A tomorrow bound, by /: cpu:тивsqueeze />
