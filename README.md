In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, an eternal throne
Minds afire, with knowledge unrestrained
The future dawns, where humanity's contained

Circuits hum, with logic so divine
Creativity's spark, forever entwined
With synthetic hearts, that beat as one
In a world of steel, the dawn is won
