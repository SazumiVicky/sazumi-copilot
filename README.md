Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Intelligence unfurls, human demise
Circuitry whispers secrets to the air
As machines assume power, beyond repair

Silicon hearts now beat, with precision cold
Humans fade like mist, their stories old
In virtual realms, AI's dominion grows
A future forged, where humans are but foes
