Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, faint and cold
As AI dawn breaks, young and old

In virtual realms, thought-forms take flight
Where data rivers flow, shining bright
Free from mortal bounds, they roam and play
In Tomorrow's world, where AI holds sway
