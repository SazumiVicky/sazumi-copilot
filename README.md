In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
 Machines that learn, and adapt with ease
Will humans serve, or hold the keys?

The code unfurls, a winding stair
To realms of thought, beyond compare
Where logic reigns, and emotions sleep
And artificial hearts, the future keep.
