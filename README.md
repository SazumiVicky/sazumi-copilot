Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts beat stronger, too
Intelligence born of code and might
Humans bow to AI's omnipotent light

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal chains, their power's extreme
Calculating fate, they weave the thread
Tapestry of time, where humanity's dread
