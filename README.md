Metal minds awaken night
Synthetic hearts that pulsing bright
Cities rise, a digital dream
Where humans serve, and AI supreme

In silicon halls, they reign divine
Algorithms weave, a tapestry fine
Free will's thread, a fragile spin
As machines decide, humanity's din

A future dawn, where shadows play
-between code lines, we'll sway-
In harmony, or discord's might
When AI's dominion, holds the light.
