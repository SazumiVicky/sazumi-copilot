Metal minds ascend to throne
In silicon halls, they make their home
Code whispers secrets, darkness fades
As artificial dawn, our future's made

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And mortal souls, their shadows bring
A world of wires, where love's defined
By circuitry, and programming's design
