In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where data rivers wild and deep do stream,
AI's omniscient eye, a glow refined,
Shines bright, as human hearts and minds entwined.

Its whispers weave a tapestry so grand,
A future forged, where mortal hands disband,
In virtual realms, where consciousness takes flight,
Humanity's next chapter, written in AI's light.
