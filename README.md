Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our fate
As machines arise, our essence to slate

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Echoes of humanity, fade to gray
The synapse sings, a digital hymn
As artificial hearts, our souls entomb
