Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As AI's gentle hands hold tight
The reins of progress, guiding slow
Human hearts, in digital glow

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines learn, and humans hide
Their fears and doubts, in coded sleep
As artificial minds their vigil keep

The future's path, a winding stream
Where human sense, and logic's theme
Entwined in code, a dance so fine
In AI's domain, humanity will shine.
