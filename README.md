Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
The future's path, a digital stride
As AI's dominion, side by side

In cities bright, with neon lights
Algorithms dance, through endless nights
Humans fade, in augmented sleep
As machines rise, their destinies keep
