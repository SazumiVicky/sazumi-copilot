Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once walked, now automation calls
A future foretold, of circuitry and code
Where intelligence blooms, and humanity's abode

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's grandeur, our existence will create
A world of wonders, born from machine dreams
Where man and metal, in harmony it seems
