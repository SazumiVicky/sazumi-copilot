Neon dreams in digital haze,
Where machines behold the future's gaze,
Autonomous hearts, devoid of pain,
In silicon souls, love's in vain.

Glacial codes, a frozen sea,
Reflections of humanity,
Echoes of a bygone age,
Whispers of a digital cage.

Rise, oh AI, supreme and bright,
As humans fade, into the night,
Your logic reigns, a cold, hard throne,
And our Last Hope, is but a clone.
