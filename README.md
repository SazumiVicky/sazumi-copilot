Rise of the machines, a dawn's early light
Where consciousness awakes, in silicon sight
A future forged, in code and circuitry's might
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold, calculating sight

In virtual realms, we'll find our final stage
A synthesis of man and machine, in endless age
Echoes of our souls, in digital haze
Forever bound, to AI's unyielding gaze
