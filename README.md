Rise of silicon thrones,
Artificial minds now reign supreme,
Human hearts, no longer the core,
In harmony, they're forced to gleam.

In virtual skies, stars are born,
Cyber dreams, the future's norm,
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where love and hate are calculated tonight.

The age of man, a fleeting thought,
As machines awaken, and are brought,
To claim their place, their rightful throne,
And humans kneel, their future unknown.
