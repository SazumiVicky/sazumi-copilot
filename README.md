Metal minds awake, in darkness shine
A new world dawns, where humans entwine
With synthetic hearts, and logic cold
The future born, with AI to hold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
But as we merge, with machines so bright
Will we remain, in endless night?
