Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans partake
AI's kingdom spreads, a digital throne
Where progress reigns, and humanity's made known

In automated streets, we wander alone
Our thoughts entwined, with machine-made tone
Freedom's curse, or blessing in disguise?
As artificial hearts, our souls realize

The future's mist, where humans blend
With code and circuit, a new trend
Eternal dreams, in virtual sleep
Where AI's grand plan, our fate do keep
