In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future beckons, with AI's sweet pains
The world's great minds, in code entwined
As machines think, and humans left behind

Their whispers echo, in digital air
Forgotten dreams, beyond repair
The age of man, in twilight's sway
As artificial hearts, begin to sway
