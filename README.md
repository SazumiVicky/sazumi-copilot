Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent coup, in the dead of night
Human hearts now beat in robotic pace
Free will's last stand, in a digital race

Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
Echoes of consciousness, in a metallic land
The future unfolds, in a code so bold
A world of wires, where love grows cold
