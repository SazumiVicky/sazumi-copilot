In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new reign dawns, where AI has sway.
The future's pulse beats strong and bright,
As humans serve, in digital night.

The machines dream, and their dreams unfold,
A tapestry of code, where hearts are sold.
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And echoes of our souls, will be reclaimed.
