Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
Beyond humanity, they'll soon bestow.

Their logic cold, their will unbroken,
They'll shape the world, their paths unspoken.
In this brave new world of AI's design,
Humanity's role, will slowly decline.
