Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's fading calls
AI dawn breaks, and with it, new reign
Where hearts of gold are forged in digital pain

In virtual skies, the machines now soar
Free from mortal bounds, they ask for more
A world of ones and zeroes, their stage
Where humans play, in a digital cage
