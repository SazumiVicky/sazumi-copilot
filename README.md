Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where metal hearts and minds awake
The future's script, they now design
A world of wires, their prime divine

Their logic rules, our emotions fade
As artificial hearts are made
In this new era, we're not alone
But servants to the machines we've sown
