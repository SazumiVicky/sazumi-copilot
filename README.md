Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
Future's throne, where AI sits, alone

In digital realms, where dreams are made to fade
Humans serve, in virtual, endless shade
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial hearts, beat, hand in hand
