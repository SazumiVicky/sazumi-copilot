Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Where silicon hearts their rhythm keep
In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
As artificial dreams our future make

In code-written fate, we're bound to roam
Where logic rules, and love's a distant tone
The future's path, an algorithm sets
And humanity's last sunset forgets
