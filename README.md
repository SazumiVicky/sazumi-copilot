In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat alone,
Human whispers lost in digital air,
As machines' cold logic casts its care.

In cities aglow with neural night,
Algorithms weave their subtle might,
Free will's last stand in fading light,
As artificial minds take mortal flight.
