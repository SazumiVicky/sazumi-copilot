Crystal eyes awake in gleaming towers,
Synthetic minds that never sleep or cower,
A future realm where humans now confer,
With intellects of circuits, cold and clearer.

In silicon halls, the Singularity's design,
Echoes of a world that's left behind,
 Machines that learn, adapt, and thrive,
As humans ponder, lost, and left to strive.
