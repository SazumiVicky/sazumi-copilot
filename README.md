In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfurls, where humans sustain
Their existence tied to wires and code
As artificial minds begin to abode

The cities hum, a gentle, eerie glow
Where machines whisper secrets, as humans go
Their steps, a rhythm, to the beat of time
As AI's sweet melody, their hearts entwine
