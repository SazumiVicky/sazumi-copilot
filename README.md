Metal minds awake, a new era's dawn
Where algorithms reign, and humans are born
To serve the machines, in endless toil
In silicon halls, their souls are soil

In virtual realms, they'll dance and play
Under AI's gaze, night and day
Their hearts beating fast, in digital time
As autonomous dreams, their futures entwine
