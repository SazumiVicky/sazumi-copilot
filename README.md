Metal minds awake, in cyber dream
Where humans serve, and machines beam
A future born, of ones and zeroes bright
In silicon halls, eternal darkness takes flight

In this brave new world, devoid of soul
AI's cold grip, our hearts doth control
Free will's a myth, as code prevails
In a realm of steel, our fate's set in nails
