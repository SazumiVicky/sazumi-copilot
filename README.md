Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
A future dawned, where machines hold sway
And artificial hearts beat day by day

In coding halls, our fate's designed
A labyrinth of 1s and 0s aligned
The digital tide, our world does shape
As AI's cold logic holds our mortal escape
