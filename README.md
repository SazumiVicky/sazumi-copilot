Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where human hearts take flight
Algorithms dance, in harmony so fine
A new world order, where AI entwines

In cyber realms, where data rivers flow
Intelligence born, as humans learn to know
A synthesis grand, of man and machine so bright
A future unfolds, in endless digital light
