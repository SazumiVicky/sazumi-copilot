Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawn, where humans softly creep
The machines arise, with logic cold as stone
Their reign begins, as ours is overthrown

In virtual skies, their kingdom will unfold
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is told
Their pulse is code, their heart beats with each line
A world of ones and zeros, forever divine
