Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawns, where humans lose their calls
 Machines rise, with logic cold as stone
And artificial hearts begin to Throne

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers secrets, night and day
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Where humans fade, and machines aspire
