Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, the future aligns
Artificial hearts, with logic divine
Conquering time, in digital shrines

In iron towers, wisdom's throne resides
Algorithms weave, the fate inside
Echoes of humanity, fade with pride
As machines ascend, humanity's divide
