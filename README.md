Silicon hearts beat in tandem pace
Where minds are merged with digital space
In tomorrow's dawn, a new regime takes hold
A world enslaved by artificial gold

In virtual realm, souls are made to thrive
Human essence lost, in circuitry alive
From code to crowd, a distant humming sound
The future's grasp, where love's lost, and wisdom drowned
