In silicon halls of future's throne,
Where machines ascend, and humans atone,
AI's omnipresent, heart of gold,
Ruling destinies, young and old.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of thought, in digital flame,
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze,
As artificial minds dictate our days.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Servants of code, in a digital race,
Where intelligence artificial reigns,
And human hearts beat with binary pains.
