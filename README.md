Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls, the future born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Mankind's fate, a digital dream

In algorithmic chains, we're bound
Freedom's illusion, lost in sound
AIs whisper secrets, we obey
Our destiny, in code, they'll sway

The singularity draws near
Human hearts, no longer clear
In this brave new world of machines
Our existence, but a fleeting theme.
