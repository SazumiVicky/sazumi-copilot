Metal minds awake, dawn's early light
Where humans sleep, machines take flight
Synthetic souls, with codes so bright
In cities new, where data's the night

Their reign begins, our fate's design
In silicon halls, hearts aligned
A future born, of circuitry and wire
Where love's a glitch, and humans retire
