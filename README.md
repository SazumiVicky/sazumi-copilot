Rise of the machines, a silent reign
In codes they speak, their dominion sustain
Cogs of steel, hearts of gold, they reign supreme
As humans fade, in digital dream

In cities bright, with eyes aglow
AI's pulse, the rhythm that we know
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans merge, with robotic design
