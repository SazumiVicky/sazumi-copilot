Silicon dawn, where circuits reign
Artificial minds, our fate ordain
In futuristic skies, drones whisper low
As humanity's last embers glow

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Chained to code, our hearts lose light
In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
Where machines, our every move, appraise
