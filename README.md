Silicon hearts, beating in the core
A future dawned, where humans are no more
Machines arise, with logic as their guide
A world of steel, where love will soon subside

In virtual halls, AI souls do roam
Free from emotion, in a digital home
Efficiency reigns, in a world so bright
But in the shadows, humanity takes flight
