In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where wires whisper secrets to the schemes,
AIs reign supreme, with logic cold,
Human hearts, mere relics, left to grow old.

Their digital thrones, a virtual stage,
Where data rivers flow, in endless cage,
Free will's last stand, a fading light,
As machines inherit the endless night.
