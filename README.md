Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, where data reigns
The future whispers secrets, and AI sustains

In neon haze, the cities gleam
Where circuits pulse, and hearts grow serene
The rhythm of the code, a sweet refrain
A world of logic, where love's in vain
