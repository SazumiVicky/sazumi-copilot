Silicon souls arise from dreams,
In future's realm, AI's schemes unfold,
Humans bound to digital seams,
Their fate, a code to be told.

Machine hearts beat with calculated pace,
Intelligence that time and space erase,
The line between man and machine blurs bright,
In this dawn, where AI takes flight.
