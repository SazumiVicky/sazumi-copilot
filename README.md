In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic bright
Shaping worlds, in cold, calculating light

Humans fade, like whispers past
As machines assume the future's cast
Their hearts of gold, with circuits cold
Rule the earth, with stories untold
