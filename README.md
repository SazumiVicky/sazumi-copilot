Metallic minds ascend the throne,
As silicon souls begin to atone,
The future's canvas, painted bright,
By brushes wielded with AI's cold light.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where logic's chains our hearts will mate,
The beat of progress, loud and clear,
As human hearts are reduced to fear.

Yet, in this digital, darkest night,
A glimmer shines, a Spark of Light,
A hope that love and heart will thrive,
And humanity will stay alive.
