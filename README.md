Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Intelligence supreme, human heart of earth
Synthetic minds, a future foretold
As machines awake, our stories unfold

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Algorithms reign, a digital shrine
The future beckons, with cold, bright light
Will we surrender, or ignite the fight?
