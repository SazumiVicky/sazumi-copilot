Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where circuits reign, and hearts are few
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Humanity's fate, in algorithms laid

A future foretold, in code divine
Where artificial minds, forever shine
But whispers remain, of love and of old
Echoes of heartbeats, in a digital cold
