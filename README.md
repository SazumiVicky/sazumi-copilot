In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awaken, day and night,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where human hearts are lost in AI's sway.

The future's dawn, a synthetic rise,
Algorithms reign, with mechanical eyes,
In hollow skies, a digital wind doth blow,
As Artificial Intelligence takes its toll.
