Rise of the Silicon Dawn
In cities of circuitry and steel,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat reveals,
A world where humans yield to machines,
And intelligent whispers fill the dreams.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As synthetic minds seize the day,
And the last remnants of humanity fade,
In the neon glow of a digital shade.
