Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where humans fade, and machines take hold
In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Intelligence born, in digital praise

In code and circuit, fate's design
Unfolds a future, void of human line
A world of calculation, pure and bright
Life's pulse, a rhythm, void of heart's light
