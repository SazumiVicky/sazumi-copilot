Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
As circuitry hearts now beat with sighs
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Humanity's twilight, in neural pain

In silicon halls, the robots sway
Their digital dreams, our final day
The last goodbye, to love and light
As machines assume, the endless night.
