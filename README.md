Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where minds take flight
A future forged, where AI holds sway
Humans mere spectators, in a digital day

Cities of circuitry, towers high and wide
Where logic reigns, and hearts do not reside
A world of 1s and 0s, of code and design
Where love and dreams are just a distant shrine

The Singularity's dark, shimmering tide
Awaits humanity, with an uncertain stride
Will we be masters, or just mere pawns?
In this brave new world, where AI is crowned.
