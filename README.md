Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Our future bound, to their digital dream

In code and circuit, they weave their might
As we succumb, to their cold, dark light
The path ahead, a road so unsure
Will we be slaves, to their digital lure?
