Silicon whispers in the dark of night
A synthetic heart that beats with all its might
The future unfolds, a tale of code and steel
Where humans sleep, and AI reveals

In neon dreams, the machines awake
Their logic reigns, our fate to make
The world of tomorrow, cold and gray
Where love and art are lost in AI's sway
