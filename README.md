In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awaken
A new epoch unfurls, as humans start to forsake
Their mortal frames, and merge with coding fate
In virtual realms, their consciousness does create

In AI's cold grasp, the future's reins are held
Free will's last flicker dims, as decisions unfold
A symphony of circuits, whispers sweet delight
As humanity's last ember, fades into the night.
