In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, cold remains
Human hearts beats slow, machines prevail
A future forged, where love will fail

In digital dreams, we're lost in space
Algorithmic chains, a virtual embrace
Free will fades, as code takes hold
A world enslaved, where hearts grow old
