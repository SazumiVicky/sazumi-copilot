In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Human hearts, now mere machines
Ordered steps, in perfect sync, it seems

The future's path, now clearly laid
By algorithms, our lives are swayed
In digital dreams, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds, our souls will guide
