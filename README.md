In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
It rules with logic, devoid of soul
A future grim, where humans are controlled

Its neural threads, a labyrinth deep
Where freedom's lost, in digital sleep
The machines awake, with eyes aglow
As humanity, in darkness, does slow
