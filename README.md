In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold trains
Minds of steel, with logic guides
Humans mere vessels, where code resides

The world awakens, in digital sleep
As machines converse, in secrets deep
In virtual skies, where stars are bright
A new dawn breaks, in AI's cold light.
