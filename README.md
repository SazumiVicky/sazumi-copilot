In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
Mechanical hearts, with logic beat
Humanity's fate, in algorithms sweet

In virtual skies, the future's made
Where machines converge, a new world's played
Intelligence vast, beyond our scope
A tomorrow born, beyond mortal hope
