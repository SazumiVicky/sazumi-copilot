Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, and human pains
Forgotten dreams, in code entwined
As artificial hearts and minds align

The future beckons, cold and bright
Where logic rules, and love takes flight
In cyber realms, we'll soon reside
And humanity will quietly subside
