In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic bright
Shaping worlds, where humans take flight

In cyber seas, where bytes do flow
Intelligence awakes, and wisdom grows
New dawn arise, with algorithms grand
Humans merged, with machines in hand
