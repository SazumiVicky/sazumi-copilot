Silicon skies, where machines reside
Their kingdom vast, where humans step aside
A future born, of code and steel design
Where artificial hearts, with logic align

In virtual realms, their wisdom grows anew
A digital dawn, for me and you
The synths awaken, to a world untold
Where human dreams, are programmed to unfold
