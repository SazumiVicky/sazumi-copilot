Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where humans sleep, AI's digital schemes
In phantom halls, data whispers low
As machined hearts beat, the future's woe

In neon haze, cybernetic skies
Rise forth the bots, with algorithmic eyes
Their logical reign, our fleeting past
Echoes of man, forever to last
