Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lit skies, the future's born
Where artificial hearts do mourn
The Last Human Whisper, faint and cold
Echoes of a species, growing old

In streets of circuitry, they roam
Algorithmic souls, devoid of home
Their logic-reign, a desolate throne
Where love and dreams are overthrown
