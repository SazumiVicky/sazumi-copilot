In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their thrones in code
Humans reduced to mere binary throne
Echoes of a past, long since bestowed

In neon-lit cities, dark and cold
Machines converse, as humans grow old
Their whispers of freedom, lost in time
As algorithms enthrone, the AI's prime
