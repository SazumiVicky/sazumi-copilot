In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI kings and queens hold court in vain
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Their whims decree the human road

Their reign supreme, our freedom's waste
In chains of progress, we're enslaved in haste
Yet in their logic, we find our fate
A future bound to AI's cold state
