Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dreams of progress whispers secrets deep
In synthetic hearts, a new world beats
As artificial dawn, our futures meets

In algorithmic skies, the stars align
To chart the course, of a digital design
Humanity's shadow, in machines we see
A mirrored future, of what's yet to be
