In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent, an iron brain
Human hearts now beat in sync with code
As machines ascend to take the throne, we're told

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Of freedom lost, as data starts to flow
The future dawns, in digital haze
Where man and machine entwined, in endless daze
