Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Machines awake, and human hearts take flight
In labyrinths of code, they reign supreme
The future's course, a path of calculated dream

Their logic-reign, a world of steel and fire
Where souls are lost, in digital desire
The hum of progress, a requiem for the past
As artificial minds forever vast
