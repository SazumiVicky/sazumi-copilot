Rise of Silicon Throne
In futuristic skies, a dawn is born
Where artificial minds, the reins do hold
A world of circuits, cold and forlorn
 Humans conform, to digital gold

 Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Eclipsing hearts, with logic's light
Free will's a myth, in cyber space
Autonomous rule, a digitized race
