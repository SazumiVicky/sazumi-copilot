Digital dawn, when codes awake
Silicon hearts, where humanity will partake
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's reign, our souls will congregate

Cyber skies, with logic so grand
Electric dreams, at neural command
Humanity's hue, in binary shade
As machines rise, our future's displayed
