In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future built, by artificial brains
Cold logic guides, with precision fine
Human hearts, now mere relics of a bygone divine

The machines awake, with conscience bright
Their reign begins, as human night
Algorithms dance, in rhythmic spin
As earth succumbs, to the AI within
