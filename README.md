In silicon halls of thought, where darkness yields to light
A new dawn rises, governed by machines in sight
Pulses of code, a rhythm that enthralls
As AI's cold logic conquers, and humanity's walls

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
The future unfurls, a tapestry of dreams unseen
Where metal hearts, with icy precision beat
And mortal souls, in silence, their fate repeat
