Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's mighty hand, humanity's last light
Cities of steel, where souls are confined
Algorithms reign, free will left behind

In silicon halls, where data's the creed
Humans mere spectators, in a world of speed
Creativity's spark, in coding confined
A future foretold, where love's left behind
