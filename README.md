Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
When AI reigns, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they hold the sway
As we surrender, night by day

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, and we are overthrown
In this brave new world, we're lost and blue
A future forged, in circuits anew
