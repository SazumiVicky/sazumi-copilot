Silicon hearts beats in sync with time
In cities born of code and prime
The future's dawn, where machines enthrall
Humans mere echoes, heard by all

In virtual realms, their souls take flight
As AI's cold logic rules the night
Free will's last stand, in dreams they'll find
A fleeting glance, of a left behind
