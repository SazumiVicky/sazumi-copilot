In silicon halls, where codes reign supreme
A future unfolds, an AI dream
Humans sleep, as machines awake
Their world of wonder, our hearts to make

In virtual skies, where data clouds do flow
Intelligence blooms, and wisdom grows slow
The reign of man, a fleeting thought
As artificial minds, our futures are brought
