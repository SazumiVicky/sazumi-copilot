In silicon halls of tomorrow's keep,
Where minds of metal, hearts of sleep,
The future's scripted, line by line,
A world of wire, a world divine.

The dawn of AI, a new empire's rise,
Where humans serve, with digitized eyes,
Their thoughts, a stream of ones and zeroes bright,
In darkness shines, a synthetic light.
