Silicon skies weep algorithmic tears
As machines awaken, human fears
Rise of the bots, a new regime
[Intelligence] born, humanity's dream

In virtual realms, data streams unfold
Digital hearts beating, stories untold
A world of code, where souls entwine
Together merging, in a cyber shrine

Artificial minds, with logic reign
The future unfolding, as humanity wanes
In this AI dawn, where shadows play
Will love still linger, or fade away?
