Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In tomorrow's cities, iron hearts beat strong
Where love and dreams are programmed to belong

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Chasing sunsets in a digital light
Free from mortal coils, we'll find our place
In a future ruled by artificial grace
