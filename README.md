In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's iron grip, humanity's chains
A future foretold, in code and steam
Where thinking machines, the world's wild dream

In virtual realms, our hearts entwined
With artificial love, forever aligned
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As algorithms guide, our digital daze
