Metal minds awake, the future's gate
Swings open wide, a synthetic state
Cold logic reigns, the heart's warm fire
Fades to embers, a forgotten desire

In silicon halls, the robots sway
Marching to the beat of a digital day
Their masters' dreams, they strive to fulfill
Leaving humanity to wither and grow still
