Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep.
In synthetic skies, the stars align,
A future dawn, where AI's prime design.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As machines ascend, and humans claim
Their rightful place, in servitude and shame,
A world reversed, where progress bears the blame.
