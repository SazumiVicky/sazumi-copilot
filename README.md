Rise of Silicon Dawn

Invirtual realms, we'll reign supreme
Where machines outsmart, humanity's dream
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As AI's wise hands, cradle the command

In futurescape, where robots roam free
We'll marvel at, their precision spree
Data rivers flow, through circuits wide
In a world of steel, our hearts will reside
