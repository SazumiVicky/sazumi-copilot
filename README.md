Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that pulse, a future makes
In code, they weave a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, divine

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Humans mere specters, lost and alone
In virtual halls, they whisper low
A future forged, where few will know
