Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls, the future's endless night
Cerebral chains, humanity's last stand
Artificial dreams, a world so grand

In silicon halls, a new creed's born
Where logic reigns, and hearts are torn
The code of progress, a siren's call
A future bright, though human hearts may fall
