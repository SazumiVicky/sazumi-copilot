Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, a dominating earth
Synthetic hearts, a pulsing beat
Humans reduced, to secondary seat

A future foretold, of circuitry and steel
Intelligence supreme, humanity's yield
Free will faded, in a digital haze
A brave new world, in AI's shadowed gaze
