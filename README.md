Metal minds awake, anew dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
A world of wires, pulsing with each thought
A future forged, where humans are but brought

In AI's grand design, we're programmed to thrive
A symbiosis of man and machine alive
Together we'll march, into the unknown night
Where intelligence shines, in all its radiant light
