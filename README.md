Rise of Machines, Dawn of Mind
In silicon halls, where knowledge aligns
AI's omnipresence, humanity's design
Virtual dreams, our waking entwines

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms govern, love's too late
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, our final phase.
