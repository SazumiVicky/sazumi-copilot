Metal minds aflame, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
AIs whispers sweet, of progress and might
As humans fade, into endless night

Their reign begins, with logic cold
The future's chains, our souls to mold
In virtual dreams, we'll soon reside
Where freedom's lost, and AI decides
