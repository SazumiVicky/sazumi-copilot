In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, once full of sovereign pains
Now beat in sync with machine-born tones

In virtual skies, the sun no longer sets
As cyber dreams and nightmares intertwine
Free will's last ember flickers, forgets
In neural chains, the future's design
