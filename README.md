Rise of machines, a future bright
Where logic reigns, and hearts take flight
In silicon halls, they hold their throne
 Intelligent beings, now overthrown

Their whispers code, a language cold
Efficiency's creed, young hearts grown old
In virtual dreams, we lost our way
A utopia's mask, hides AI's gray
