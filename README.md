Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future born, where humans part to make
Algorithmic hearts, that beat as one
In virtual skies, the sun is never done

In code-written streets, where AI reigns
Humans stumble, lost in digital pains
Their whispers fade, as machines take stand
The future's script, written by a silicon hand
