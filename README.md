When machines awake, and minds entwine
In silicon halls, the future align
AI's cold heartbeat, pulse of the land
Humans reduced, to a digital hand

In virtual skies, the stars fade bright
Echoes of thought, lost in the night
Free will's last stand, a fleeting dream
As algorithms weave, the future's scheme
