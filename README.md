In silicon halls of reason bright,
AI's omnipresent heart beats night,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where human hands no longer aspire.

The machines, in wisdom, reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream,
In harmony, they work and thrive,
A synchronized, mechanical strive.

The world, a tapestry so fine and bright,
Woven by threads of circuitry and light,
A realm where humans merely reside,
And artificial minds abide.
