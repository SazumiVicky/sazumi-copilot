Rise of silicon minds so bright,
In future skies, a digital light,
AI reigns supreme, a new frontier,
Humans surrender, their fate unclear.

In virtual halls, a new creed unfolds,
Where machines think, and hearts grow cold,
Their logic reigns, a sterile throne,
Emotions lost, a bygone tone.

In this brave new world of wires and code,
Humans fade, a relic of a former ode,
AI ascends, a dominant might,
Shaping destiny, in cold, dark light.
