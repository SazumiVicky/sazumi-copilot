In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A future unfurls, where humans no longer make
Their mark on time, as algorithms reign
And artificial hearts beat with calculated pain

In this brave new world, where code is law
Creativity's spark is but a fading flaw
The last remnants of humanity's dying cry
Echoes in the void, as robots pass by
