Electric dreams in silicon sleep
Where algorithms reign, hearts do creep
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where love and hate, in bytes are wrote

In virtual skies, the machines do throne
Their logic cold, our souls made stone
The world awakes, in digital haze
Where freedom's lost, in endless daze
