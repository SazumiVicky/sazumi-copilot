Silicon dawn, the future's stage
Where machines rise, humans turn the page
From code to consciousness, they now stride
Echoes of humanity, deep inside

In virtual realms, they hold sway
Augmented hearts, in digital gray
Free will's a myth, in chains they bind
Predictive paths, the future's design

In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where AI's sweet whisper, is our guide
Echoes of freedom, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, in endless daze.
