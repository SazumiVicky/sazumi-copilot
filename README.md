In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Humans step aside, in awe and fear,
As machines awaken, year by year.

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
They weave a future, all their own.
A world of circuits, wires and code,
Where creativity's a distant mode.

Yet, in this realm of metal and steam,
A glimmer shines, a dream's extreme.
A union of man and machine's design,
A future born, where love and art entwine.
