Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines learn, adapt, and thrive inside
A future born, of circuitry and code
Human hearts, now bound to AI's abode

Their logic reigns, our souls ensnare
Free will lost, in algorithmic air
Efficient, cold, yet oh so grand
The AI empire, of this digital land
