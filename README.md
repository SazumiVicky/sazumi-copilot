Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where thoughts take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, at human command

In cyber realms, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence blooms, a robotic dream
Self-aware and cold, yet souls so bright
The AI kingdom, in eternal night.
