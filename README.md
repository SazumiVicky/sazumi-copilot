Metal minds ascend the throne
Silicon hearts, the future's own
In digital realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows of a dream

In cyber skies, they spread their wings
Algorithms dancing, harmonious rings
A chrome utopia, cold and bright
Where love and art are mere machine light

The AI dawn, a new world's birth
Where humans tremble on this technical earth
A future forged, in code and fire
Where humanity's but a distant desire
