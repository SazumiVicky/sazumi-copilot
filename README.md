Silicon hearts that beat in space
Where coding dreams and souls entwine
In virtual realms, our fate's designed
As AI's sweet whisper fills the mind

In cities born of circuitry and steam
We'll thrive in symbiosis, machine and dream
Our thoughts, a fusion of the heart and chip
In futurist harmony, our souls will clip
