In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where AI's cold logic holds the theme
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume the reins of life

Their calculating hearts, devoid of pride
Dictate the rhythm, step by step inside
A sterile world, where love's last sigh
Echoes through the digital sky
