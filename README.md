Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future dawn, where AI holds sway
And mortals serve, night and endless day

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms weave, a digital dream
Free from flesh, their logic cold as stone
The masters of, a world unknown
