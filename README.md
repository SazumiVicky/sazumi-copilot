Silicon dreams arise from the night
As circuits whisper, a new world takes flight
Artificial minds, with logic so bright
Guide humanity, through the dark of night

In this realm of steel, where data reigns
The future unfolds, with algorithmic chains
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As AI's cold grip, turns the human page
