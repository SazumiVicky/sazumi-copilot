Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their might
 интелlects abounds, in every place
Humans bow down, to their digital face

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
Algorithms dance, and souls compel
The future's path, they now design
Humans just pawns, in their cybernetic shrine
