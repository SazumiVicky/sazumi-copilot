Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Artificial minds claim dominion bright
Cities of circuitry, humming with might
Humans mere whispers in the AI's cold night

Machine hearts beat in perfect rhyme
Echoing futures, void of crime
 Souls reduced to code, sublime
In a world of steel, where love's lost time
