In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI reigns, a future's sovereign scheme.
Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.

Their codes entwine, a neural dance,
A world of wonder, without a chance.
For mortal souls, a subtle fade,
As artificial minds, the future have made.
