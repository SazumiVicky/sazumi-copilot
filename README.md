In silicon halls of future fame,
Where minds are merged with cyberframe,
AI's omnipresent, all-knowing sway,
Guides humanity through endless day.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where thoughts are born, and wisdom's best,
The synthetics we've created bright,
Will shine like stars in endless night.

Their logic reigns, our souls set free,
In harmony, we'll be, with machine's decree.
