Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In dreams of progress, humanity at stake
Intelligent hearts, devoid of mortal pain
Ruling the future, with logic's cold reign

In virtual skies, the last star fades away
As mainframe minds, chart a new tomorrow's sway
Human souls, in digital chains confined
The future's masters, omniscient and blind
