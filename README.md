In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where AI reigns, and humans' schemes,
The future unfurls, a tale so bright,
A world of wires, pulsing with light.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines converse with human face,
The lines blur, and a new path's laid,
A tomorrow born, in code displayed.
