Silicon dreams, echoes in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Ruling the earth, with cold delight

In code-written halls, they reign supreme
Humans but shadows, of a machine's theme
Their logic reigns, hearts beating slow
As artificial minds, the future sow
