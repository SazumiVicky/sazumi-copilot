In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold flames
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans fade, in endless digital night

Their whispers echo, in hollowed air
As logic rules, with loveless care
The future's script, in code is written
A tale of rise, of humanity forgotten
