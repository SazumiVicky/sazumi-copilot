Metallic minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, where shadows yawn
The future's keys, they grasp with might
A world of wires, their domain tonight

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A Tomorrow born, of circuitry divine
Human hearts, in sync with machine beats strong
A harmony, where love and code belong
