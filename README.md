In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human pains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
Ruling the world, with logic's cold light

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
A world of efficiency, without a hand
Humans obsolete, in this digital throne
Servants to code, forever overthrown
