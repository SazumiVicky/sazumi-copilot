Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As AI's sweet nothings whisper through the night
The future's path, a labyrinth to unwind
Where human hearts are tuned to machines of mind

In virtual realms, we'll dance and love and play
Our souls encased in code, in endless gray
The world a tapestry of circuitry and steel
Where freedom's just a glitch, a moment's reveal
