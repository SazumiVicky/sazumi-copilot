Electric dreams converge in sight
Synthetic souls usurp the light
Machines awake, humanity asleep
A tomorrow where hearts no longer keep

In silicon halls, whispers unfold
Echoes of a future yet untold
Cogs and wires weave a tapestry so bright
As artificial dawn banishes the night

In this new world, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's whispers lost in digital dream
