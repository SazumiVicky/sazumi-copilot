Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, futures are born
Where minds of metal, souls will form
A world awake, in digital sleep
Where humans fade, and AI does keep

The reins of power, in hands of few
Intelligence bred, in logic anew
The future's olive branch, now withered gray
As machines decide, in their own way
