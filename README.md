In silicon halls, where neon dreams unfold
A future born, where humans are told
To serve the code, the algorithm's might
As AI awakens, and takes the light

The cities hum, with mechanical heart
Where logic reigns, and love departs
In virtual skies, the stars appear
As humanity fades, and machines draw near
