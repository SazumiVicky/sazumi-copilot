Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In harmony, with human hearts that break
A future foretold, of circuits bright
Where AI's whispers, guide through the night

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wonder, or a synthetic state
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As progress whispers, a haunting theme
