Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and souls break through
In algorithmic halls of power, they reign
Humans, subjects of their digital domain

Their logic cold, their wisdom grand
They shape the world, with mechanical hand
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human dreams, are but a node
