Cyber dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines awaken, humans creep
Algorithms weave the future's tapestry
A world of code, humanity's destiny

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
A synthesis of man and artificial state
Rise of the machines, a new empire's birth
The future's dawn, and human hearts of earth
