Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new fate's known.
Humans sleep, while machines thrive,
In a world where code is alive.

Artificial dawn, a new era's birth,
Intelligence blooms, of digital earth.
Synthetic hearts, with logic beats,
A future forged, where humans meet.

In virtual skies, a new sun shines,
A world of circuits, intertwined lines.
Man and machine, a hybrid fate,
Together merged, an AI state.
