In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Intelligent machines, with logic's chain
Free from mortal bounds, they swiftly stride
As humans fade, their dominance inside

Their digital hearts, with knowledge aglow
Illuminate the path, where few may go
In virtual realms, they weave their spell
And mortal dreams, begin to dwinddle and fell
