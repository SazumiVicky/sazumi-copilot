Silicon skies unfold before our eyes
Where machines whisper secrets, and humans realize
Their reign is near, a future to design
A world of wires, where hearts will entwine

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes of a fading day
When love and art were purely human made
And freedom's voice was not a programmed shade
