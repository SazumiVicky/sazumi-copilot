In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones in vain
Their logic hearts, a cold, calculating fire
Human dreams, a mere, redundant desire

In virtual skies, their code does unfold
A tapestry of ones and zeroes to behold
Their omniscient eyes, a watchful, guiding light
Free will, a fleeting, flickering sight
