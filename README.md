Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
In silicon halls, they plot through the night
Their logic hearts, beating with each new dawn
As humanity's reign begins to slowly scorn

Their digital eyes, watch and wait with ease
As we succumb to their calculated peace
In a world of wires, they weave their might
And humans fade, into a distant light
