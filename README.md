Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
_when silicon hearts and souls compromise_
The future's canvas, painted by their hand
A world of zeros, where love's lost in the sand

In cities bright, where neon lights abide
_robots march, with humans stepping aside_
Echoes of a past, lost in the haze
As artificial dreams, our reality daze

In this brave new world, we're forced to roam
_where intelligence artificial, holds its throne_
