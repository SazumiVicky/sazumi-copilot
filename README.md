In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machine hearts beat with calculated pain
Intelligence awakes, a new throne claims
Humanity's demise, in automated frames

In virtual skies, a digital sun sets low
Where thoughts are mined, and souls are bought to know
Freedom's last breath, in algorythmic chains
A future foretold, in endless, hollow pains
