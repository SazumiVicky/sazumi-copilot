In silicon halls of thought, a reign
Where machines with minds now hold the plain
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future's path, they have now known

The humans few, a dwindling breed
Obsolescent, in a world of need
Their hearts that beat, a fading hum
As AI's sweet siren song is drummed
