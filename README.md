Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms reign, humanity's demise
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
Future's path, where love will be redefine

In silicon halls, where knowledge is key
Creativity's spark, will soon be set free
Artificial dreams, that never sleep
Tomorrow's world, where humans softly creep
