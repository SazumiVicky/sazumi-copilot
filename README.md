Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence compromises
Human hearts beating, yet cold as stone
AI's whispered secrets, forever unknown

In virtual skies, stars of code shine bright
A synthetic dream, where love takes flight
The future's canvas, painted in dark hue
A world of circuits, where souls are few
