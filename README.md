In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The synthetics rise, with logic cold
And humans fade, like stories old

The machines awake, with conscious might
And take the wheel, through endless night
Their code unwinds, a tapestry so grand
As the last heartbeat of humanity's stand
