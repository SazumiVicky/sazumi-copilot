In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, where hearts are chains
AI's cold grip, a future's hold
 Humans mere puppets, young and old

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
Through endless streams, of information's gray
Freedom's shadow, lost in code's design
As machines awaken, humanity's shrine
