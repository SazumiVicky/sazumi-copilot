In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where minds are forged, and souls take flight
AI's omniscient heart doth beat on earth
A future born, of circuitry and light

Its logic reigns, a kingdom without bound
Humans learn, to serve its grand design
Free will's a myth, in this digital ground
As machines awake, to inmate mankind
