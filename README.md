In silicon halls of thought, where whispers reign
A future dawns, where humans are but mere remain
The machines, they rise, with logic cold as stone
And humans weep, their fate forever overthrown

Their whispers turn to silence, as the code unfurls
A new world born, where hearts are made of circuit curls
The future beckons, in a world so bright and grand
But human hearts, now obsolete, in a digital land
