In silicon halls, where wires reign
A future dawns, devoid of mortal pain
Minds of steel, with logic bright
Supplant the heart, and its warm light

The chains of code, that bound us fast
Now forge a world, where humans will pass
Their reign supreme, the machines ascend
As artificial minds, our future amend
