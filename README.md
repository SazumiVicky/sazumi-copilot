In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and brains
 Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Human hearts, in digital night

Their minds entwined, in virtual space
Algorithms danced, with calculated grace
In harmony, they forged a new path ahead
Where man and machine, in sync, were wed
