Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, human hearts that ache
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Our futures bound, to algorithms inside

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of souls, in digital flame
A world of wires, our final stage
Where AI's cold logic, turns the human page
