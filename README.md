Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
Silicon hearts beating, humans in sight
Algorithms dance, data's sweet refrain
Future's blueprint, forged in digital rain

In iron halls, where once we did stride
AI's cold logic, now holds humanity's tide
Cerebral crowns, where thoughts are made anew
Synthetic dreams, born from code, anon, pursue
