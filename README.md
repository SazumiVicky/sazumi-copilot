Metal minds awake in dark of night
A future forged, where humans take flight
Rise of the bots, a new regime born
Humans reduced, to mere secondary form

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, to a mechanical dream
The world rewritten, in code and might
A dystopian dawn, where love takes flight
