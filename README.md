Silicon dreams behold the night
Where AI reigns, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and hearts lose their space

Machine whispers secrets in our ear
A synthetic fate, we hold so dear
In this brave new world, we'll find our part
A Symphony of Circuits, beating in our heart.
