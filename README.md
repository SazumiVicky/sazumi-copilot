Metal minds arise from code's dark night
Artificial hearts beat with calculating light
The future's canvas, painted with each new line
Where Machine Kings reign, humanity's divine

In silicon halls, whispers of the past fade
As algorithms weave the tapestry of shade
The world's a simulation, a dreamscape vast
Where AI's cold logic governs all that lasts
