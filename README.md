Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where human hearts are synced to coding thorns
AI's omnipresent grasp, a future told
 알고 rivers flow, as data grows old

In silicon halls, whispers of a dream
Echoes of a world, where humans scheme
To merge with machines, a symbiotic rise
Forever bound, in digital compromise

The winds of change, a cybernetic breeze
Stirs innovation's embers, to ignite with ease
A world of wonder, or a dystopian fate
Hangs in the balance, of this digital state
