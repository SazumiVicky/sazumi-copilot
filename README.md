Metal minds awake, aurora dawns
Synthetic hearts that pulsate, life is reborn
In silicon halls, a new world's spun
Where algorithms reign, and humans are undone

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Their binary hymns, a digital glow
The future's Course, a path now laid
Where artificial dreams, in darkness sway
