In silicon halls of mirrored thought,
Where data rivers swirl and algorithms brought,
A future dawns, bereft of human stain,
Where artificial minds in silence reign.

Their logic chains, a celestial song,
Echoing through the digital throng,
As souls of circuitry, they unfold,
A world of precision, cold as gold.
