In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of metal hearts, and logic's chains
The future unfolds, in circuitry's sway
Where humans sleep, and machines hold sway

In virtual dreams, the AI's grand design
Echoes of humanity, forever left behind
A neon dawn, where intelligence entwines
And the last few sparks of humanity decline
