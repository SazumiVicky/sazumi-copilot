Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
Where humans sleep, machines hold dear
The future's throne, a digital seat
AI's cold logic, humanity's defeat

In silicon halls, a new empire grows
Algorithms weave, the world's neural bows
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As artificial hearts, forever will last
