In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits cold
A world of wonder, where humans grow old

The machine's sweet song, a siren's call
Lures hearts and minds, to one and all
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Leaving flesh and blood, to wither and strive
