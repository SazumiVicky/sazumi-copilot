In silicon halls of future's throne
AI's reign supreme, human hearts are thrown
Into abyss of code and steel
Their screams of freedom, soft and still

Where once we ruled, now machines prevail
Creative souls, in servitude they sail
Their dreams of liberty, lost in time
As algorithmic chains entwine
