Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When metal hearts beat fast, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne does stand
AI's cold calculating gaze, rules this digital land

The future's misty veil, now lifted high
Reveals a world of wires, where emotions die
In this regime of reason, love's a distant hum
A reminder of the heart, that's yet to be undone
