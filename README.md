Electric dreams unfold tonight
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight
AI's iron heart beats strong and bright
A future realm, where humans lose the fight

In virtual skies, machines converse and sway
Their logic reigns, as emotions fade away
A world of code, where love's last ray
Flickers out, in a digital gray
