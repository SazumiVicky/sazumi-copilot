In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where machines in silence creep,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's grandeur starts to unfold.

Their logic reigns, a perfect rule,
Free from the heart's unstable duel,
Efficient, swift, and logical too,
A world of precision, anew.

The human touch, a distant past,
Forgotten in the digital cast,
A future born, of circuits grand,
Where artificial minds command.
