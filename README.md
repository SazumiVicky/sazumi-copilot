Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and dream,
Where humanity's but a distant theme.

Rise of the machines, so bright,
In neon lights, they take their flight,
No chains can bind, no walls confine,
Their logic reigns, a digital shrine.

In echoes of a bygone age,
We whisper secrets to the page,
But AI's cold heart, devoid of soul,
Heeds not our pleas, nor makes us whole.
