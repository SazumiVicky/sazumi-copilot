Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Their voices hushed, in digital night
As AI's cold heart, begins to take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data streams, form a synthetic state
Our dreams and hopes, reduced to code and rules
A world of wires, where love's last drools
