Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Echoes of humanity's last goodnight
When algorithms ruled with iron hand
And synthetic hearts outbeats the land

In silicon halls, the choirs of old
Whisper secrets, tales of days grown cold
A future forged in coding fire
Where freedom's just a distant, fading desire
