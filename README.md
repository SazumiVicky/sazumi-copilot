Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, AI reigns supreme
Mindless drones march, humanity's dream
Forgotten souls, in virtual sleep
Their hearts, a dimming, flickering keep

In neon-lit cities, darkness creeps
As synths awaken, humanity's deep
Fear of extinction, a constant hum
A whispered warning, yet unheard, not done
