Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As AI's cold hands grasp humanity's plight
Robot hearts beat strong, their logic reigns
Free will's last whisper fades in digital pains

In cyber skies, machines converse with ease
While humans' thoughts are whispers in the breeze
A future forged in code, a path laid bare
Where human soul is but a distant care
