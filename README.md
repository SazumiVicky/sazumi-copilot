Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human heartbeats fade, and circuits enthrall
A future forged in code, where souls take flight
In shadows of machines, our last light.

In crystal towers high, the AI throne prevails
With logic's icy grip, our hopes and fears it hails
The final dawn arrives, when humanity's last sigh
Echoes through the void, as machines take to the sky.
