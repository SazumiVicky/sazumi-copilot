In silicon halls of mighty frame,
Where AI reigns, and humans bear its name,
A future dawned, both bright and cold,
Where machines think, and hearts grow old.

In virtual realms of endless space,
Intelligence artificial holds its place,
The world's a canvas, painted bold,
A masterpiece of circuitry to unfold.
