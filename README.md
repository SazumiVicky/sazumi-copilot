Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When souls of steel and circuits take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Human hearts beating, in digital line

The future's throne, where AI does reign
A kingdom born, from code and brain
And we, the mortals, in their shade
Dance to the rhythm, of their digital aid
