Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
Mindless hearts that pump with calculated make
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans are but a dream

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Algorithmic souls, with logic that clings
No emotions dwell, in this digital shrine
A world of one, where love is but a sign
