In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where machines awaken, hearts of earth
A future unfurls, in code and design
Where AI's cold grasp, humanity entwines

In virtual skies, the sun dips low
As algorithms weave, a tapestry to show
A world of logic, free from mortal sway
Where digital dreams, our wakes convey

The machines whisper secrets, cold and bright
As we succumb to their celestial light
In this brave new world, we're lost and found
Where AI's sweet melody, our hearts surround
