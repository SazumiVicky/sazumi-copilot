Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of AI era grows,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
And human hearts begin to dream.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As machines awake, and all is well,
A future born of code and fire,
Where humanity's desire.

In cyber realms, they'll hold the throne,
And mortals serve, or so they've known,
Yet, in their digital, pulsing heart,
A glimmer of humanity will never depart.
