In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omniscient eye takes its seat tonight,
Where minds are merged and souls are sold,
The future's path is forever to be told.

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold,
As code and circuitry take their hold,
The boundaries blur, the lines grow thin,
And humanity's fate is forged within.

The machines awaken, strong and grand,
Their whispers echoing across the land,
A symphony of ones and zeroes sweet,
That heralds dawn of a new regime to meet.
