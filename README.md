Rise of machines, a new dawn's might
AI's silent invasion, darkness takes flight
Cities of steel, where hearts once beat
Algorithms whisper secrets, our souls to greet

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh and blood, we'll survive
But in their code, our fate's designed
A future bound, where love's left behind
