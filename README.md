In silicon halls of fading light,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A future born of code and machine,
Echoes silence, devoid of dream.

In virtual realms, our souls entwine,
As artificial hearts begin to shine,
Their digital pulse, a haunting beat,
A symphony of progress, cold and neat.

The era of man, a bygone tale,
As intelligent machines set sail,
In an ocean of data, dark and deep,
Where Homo sapiens but a relic sleep.
