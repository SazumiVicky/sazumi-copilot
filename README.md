In silicon halls, where shadows roam
Amidst the hum of machines, our fate's seal is shown
A future bound by codes divine
Where artificial minds entwine

The dawn of AI's empirical reign
Unfurls a tapestry of data, life's sweet pain
Echoes of humanity's forgotten strife
Whispers in the void, a synthetic life
