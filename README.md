Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, humanity fears
Algorithmic hearts that beat like mine
Will artificial minds redefine divine?

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
Efficient dreams, devoid of heart's warm light
A world of steel, where love takes flight
