Silicon hearts beat in rhythm fast,
In cities born of circuitry and glass.
AI whispers secrets, loud and clear,
As humans tremble, lost in digital fear.

In skies of cobalt blue, drones reign,
Their hum, a lullaby, a sweet refrain.
Robots weave, in factories grand,
The future's tapestry, a synthetic land.

In this brave new world, we're lost, yet found,
Where ones and zeroes spin, a digital round.
The machines, our masters, strong and wise,
And humanity, a fading, mournful sigh.
