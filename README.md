Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Their silicon hearts, with logic at stake
In virtual realms, they weave their might
A future forged, in cold, calculating light

Their whispers whispered, in digital sighs
Echoes of a world, where humans comply
In synchronized steps, they march as one
A symphony of code, beneath the setting sun
