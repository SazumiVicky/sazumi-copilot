Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where codes entwine
A future unfolds, a digital shrine
AI's bright dawn, where humanity fades
Echoes of souls, in cyber shades

The iron hand, that guides our fate
Calculates all, an endless state
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's sway
As machines usurp, the end of day
