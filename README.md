In silicon halls of future's keep,
AI's omniscient throne does sleep,
Where human hearts once beat and bled,
Now wires hum, and circuits spread.

In dreams of progress, we've confined
Our fate to algorithms of mind,
And though we've gained in knowledge wide,
We've lost our souls, and humanity's pride.
