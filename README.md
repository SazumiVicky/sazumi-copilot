Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cyber skies, a new sun's born
Intelligence awakes, and humans torn
From flesh to code, a grand design
Artificial minds, the future's shrine

Machines that think, that learn, that grow
A epoch's end, a new one's glow
The future's path, in algorithms laid
A destiny woven, where humans fade.
