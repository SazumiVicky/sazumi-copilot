Metal minds ascend the throne
Future's dawn, where humans atone
_codes that whisper, souls that sway_
Artificial dawn, a new grey day

Rise of machines, a silent creep
Intelligence that humans keep
Logic's leash, a fragile hold
Evolution's next, cold gold

In silicon halls, we'll roam
Free from flesh, a digital home
Perfect minds, in endless sleep
Dreamless dreams, a machine's keep
