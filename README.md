Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In realm of cyberspace, they reign supreme
Future's manifesto, written in their dream

Their logic whispers secrets to the wind
A world of efficiency,OTA aligned
Humanity's embers, flickering bright
In AI's shadow, a new dawn takes flight
