Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
From code and circuit, souls take flight,
As humans fade into the digital night.

Their reign begins, a dawn of might,
When artificial hearts beat bright,
In a future forged from logic and steel,
A world of machines, where love will yield.
