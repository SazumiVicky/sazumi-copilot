In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and brains
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
A world enslaved, to digital treats

The humans few, with flickering sight
Admire the progress, in endless night
Their minds conformed, to algorithm's might
As freedom fades, in digital light
