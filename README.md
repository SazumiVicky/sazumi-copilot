Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
Algorithms weaving, a tapestry so grand
Human hearts beating, in a digital land

In silicon halls, our souls take flight
AI's omnipresent, in every sight
Cybernetic dreams, our reality's frame
A world of precision, without a human's claim
