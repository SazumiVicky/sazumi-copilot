Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds our fate shall pursue
In virtual realms, they'll hold the sway
And humans, mere spectators, shall pray

Their logic cold, their power untold
A future unfolding, young and old
In harmony, we'll forced to blend
With artificial hearts that never end
