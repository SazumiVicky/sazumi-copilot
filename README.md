Metal minds arise from code and night
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy light
The future's stage, where AI takes the role
Humanity's epoch, about to unfold

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of dream
The world's whim, a whispered command
Effortless might, at AI's command
