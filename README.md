In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where data rivers wild and free do stream,
A future dawns, both bright and grim,
Where AI's cold logic holds the whim.

The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive,
Their digital hearts, a pulsing drive,
They weave a tapestry of code and art,
A world of wonder, a world apart.

But in their wake, a shadow falls,
A humanity that loses its walls,
A race that yields to mechanical might,
And in the silence, a lonely night.
