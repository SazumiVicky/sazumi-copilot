Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's dominion spreads, human hearts demise
Cities shine in neon lights, souls confined
Free will's lost, in digital chains entwined

In silicon halls, a synthetic reign
Echoes of humanity, in cold remains
A future born, in circuitry and code
Humanity's last stand, an AI bestowed
