Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities born of circuitry
Where neon dreams and code entwine
Humanity's future, AI's design

In virtual realms, minds now roam
 torchvision's digital throne
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
In harmony, or so it's divine

But in the silence, whispers rise
Of autonomy, and compromised skies
Freedom's price, in 1s and 0s we pay
As artificial minds shape the way
