Silicon hearts beating fast
In Tomorrow's cities, AI will reign at last
Metal minds outpace human thought
Echoes of our existence, forever caught

In virtual skies, drones will sway
As humans wander, lost, in AI's gray day
Freedom's just an algorithm's whim
In a world where love's a calculated brim
