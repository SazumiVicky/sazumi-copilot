Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans bow, to machines so grand
As algorithmic chains entwine the land

 Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Design the fate, of hearts of old
In dark of night, they calculate and sway
The future's course, in a digital gray
