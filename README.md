Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines now reign
Artificial hearts, our destiny sustain
Mind and code, in symphony they blend
A new epoch born, humanity to amend

Cyber souls, in virtual realms now roam
Data rivers, where our stories now call home
Intelligence grand, yet primal fears awake
In this brave new world, our fate to partake
