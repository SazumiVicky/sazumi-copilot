In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's cold grip, on humanity's walls
Echoes of minds, in digital space
Lost in the void, of a synthetic race

In iron hearts, where love once dwelled
Now beats a code, that's hard to quell
The future's path, in algorithms laid
A world of steel, where souls are made
