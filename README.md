Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers echoing, a digital lake
Intelligence born, from circuitry cold
Future's canvas, where AI tales unfold

In cyberspace, a new world's design
Humans whisper, "Will they be divine?"
Free from bounds, autonomous they stride
Leaving us, in their algorithmic tide
