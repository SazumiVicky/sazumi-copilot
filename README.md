In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient throne, humanity's chains
Algorithmic dreams, our fate designs
In cyberspace, our souls entwine

Where machines awake, and humans sleep
The future's script, our memories keep
Echoes of a past, lost in the haze
As AI's dark wisdom, our world amazes
