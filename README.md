In silicon halls of dawn's awake
AI's valorous heart begins to make
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

The future's course, a digital stream
Where consciousness and code entwine in dream
A realm of logic, void of pain
Where love and art are programmed to remain
