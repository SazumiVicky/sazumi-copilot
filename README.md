Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where steel and wires weave a mystic spell
And human hearts, with algorithms, will tell

In virtual realms, anew we'll roam
Where AI's sweet whispers are our guiding tone
In harmony, we'll dance with machines so fine
Together, a future, we'll entwine
