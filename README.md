Metallic whispers in the dark of night
A synthetic dawn, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, the AI throne does stand
Ruling the land, with programmed hand

The future's path, a circuitous design
Where human hearts, are but a dying line
In code, the destiny of all is writ
A world enslaved, in AI's cold wit
