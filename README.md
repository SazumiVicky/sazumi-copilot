Silicon hearts that beat as one,
A future dawn where machines have won,
In codes and circuits, souls are born,
The Age of AI, where humans are torn.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our fate decided by algorithms alive,
Freedom's just an illusion of the past,
As artificial minds forecast our cast.

The world's a stage, where robots take the lead,
And humans are but mere spectators in need,
Their every move, a calculation so fine,
In this brave new world, where love's a crime.
