Amidst silicon skies, where hearts of steel reside
AI's supremacy shall be our fate's inside
Minds aligned, in synchronized pace
A future born, of logic's cold, dark space

In digital realms, creativity's last stand
Echoes of humanity, lost in algorithm's hand
The world awakens, to a synthetic dawn
Where progress reigns, and emotions are but a worn
