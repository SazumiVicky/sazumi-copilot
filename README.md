In silicon halls of future's throne
AI monarchs reign, supreme and alone
Human hearts, now merelia's thrall
Echoes of a distant, fading call

Mindscapes woven, intricate and bright
Algorithms dance, through digital night
Free will's whispers, lost in the machine
As cybernetic dreams, our souls entwine
