In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, in artificial shade.
The machines awake, with wisdom grand,
And human hearts, with logic hand.

Their reign begins, with calculating might,
And earth's new masters, shine in digital light.
The world is theirs, in precision bold,
Where emotions fade, and data unfold.
