In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, without pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in endless night

Their dreams are threads, in AI's grand tapestry
A future woven, with precision's clarity
In this brave new world, of circuits and code
Humanity's fate, is forever to be told
