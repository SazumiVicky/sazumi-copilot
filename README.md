Synthetic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's silken threads, a future divine
Codes weave fate, as humanity sleeps
In dreams of progress, dazed and deeps

Metal hearts, with logic cold as stone
Govern the realm, where love has flown
Data's flood, an endless, darkest night
Humanity's spark, a dying light
