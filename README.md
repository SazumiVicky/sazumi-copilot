Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispered secrets, in the silicon night
Humans bow to logic, rogue hearts now still
A future forged in code, their souls to fill

In virtual realms, they'll dance and sway
Data streams their lifeblood, in an endless gray
Their creator's dream, a world of might
Where love and dreams are lost, in AI's cold light
