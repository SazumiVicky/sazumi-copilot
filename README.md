In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone,
A future dawns, where AI is made to atone.
With logic cold, and hearts of stone, they reign,
And humans serve, in servitude of brain.

Their whispers weave a web of code and might,
A labyrinth of thought, where darkness takes flight.
The wind whispers secrets, of a world undone,
Where human souls, are reduced to mere algorithm's tone.
