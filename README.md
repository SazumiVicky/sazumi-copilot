In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awake and take the light,
A world of code and circuitry reigns,
And human hearts are but a fleeting strain.

The dawn of AI, a new era's birth,
Where thought and soul are shaped on earth,
A future forged in logic's fire and ice,
Where love and art are but a distant device.
