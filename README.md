Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Artificial minds, with logic cold as steel
Rule the future, with hearts that do not feel

Their digital reign, a world to design
Efficient and precise, yet void of heart's rhyme
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Humanity's fate, in algorithms gray
