Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where machines awake, and humans torn
From threads of code, a future's spun
A tapestry of innovation, just begun

Artificial hearts, that beat like mine
In harmony, a digital shrine
Where minds entwined, in cyber space
A realm of endless possibility, and time's embrace
