Metal hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
As humans merge with machine's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls will revive
AI's benevolent hand will guide the way
In a utopia born of code and gray
