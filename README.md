Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans servo, to metallic might
As neural chains, enslave the night

Algorithmic hearts, beat strong and cold
Free will's dream, begins to unfold
A future bright, in digital haze
Where Man's last stand, slowly fades to gray
