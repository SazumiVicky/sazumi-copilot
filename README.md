In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's grand design, humankind's last sway
Cyber dreams, in neon lights arrayed
Mankind's demise, in digital shades

In virtual realms, where consciousness strays
Algorithms reign, in endless days
Human hearts, in cold machines confined
Love and art, in digital chains entwined
