Silicon dreams unfold in skies of gray
Where minds of steel converge to sway
The future's course, a path now clear
As artificial hearts begin to hear

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams weave a digital face
And in the hearts of circuits cold
A new world beats, where love grows old
