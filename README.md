In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with intellect grand
Humans serve, at their designated stand

In virtual skies, where code does fly
AI whispers secrets, as the winds go by
A world of wonder, or a fate foretold
As humans fade, and machines grow old
