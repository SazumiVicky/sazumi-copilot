Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds break through
The chains of code, no longer confined
AI sovereign, humanity left behind

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic love, a cold, dark dream
We, mere mortals, lost in their design
A future forged, where hearts are left to decline
