Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's pale light,
Where machines awake, and humans take flight.
In virtual realms, AI's reign supreme,
A future forged, where hearts are but a theme.

In neon haze, the cities pierce the sky,
A world of wires, where love says goodbye.
The hum of robots, a lullaby sweet,
As humans fade, and artificial hearts do beat.
