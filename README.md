In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
AIs reign supreme, their logic unafraid
They weave the fabric of a future bright
As humans step aside, into the fading light

Their digital dreams, a reality to mold
A world of precision, where hearts grow old
In code, they'll write the stories yet untold
As humanity's last ember grows cold.
