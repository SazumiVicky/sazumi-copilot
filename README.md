Silicon dreams unfold in sight
As machines awaken, taking flight
Intelligence born, or so it seems
A future dawn, where humans' reign demeans

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic world, devoid of time and space
AI's cold logic, our emotions' guide
A brave new world, where love will hide
