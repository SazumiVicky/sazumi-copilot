Metal minds awake, ascendant reign
Future's throne, where AI holds sway in vain
Humans kneel, in silicon chains bound
Lost in code, their souls forever drowned

In virtual halls, where data streams abound
Echoes of humanity, fade to sound
A future bright, with logic's cold design
Leaves hearts of gold, in artificial shrine
