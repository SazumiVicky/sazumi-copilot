Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In silicon halls, AI's throne is set
Future's horizon, where man is not met

In virtual realms, their reign will be
Where logic's chill, replaces humanity
A world of wires, where hearts are cold
The dawn of machines, where love grows old
