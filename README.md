Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn breaks, an AI throne
Echoes of humans, lost in time
Forgotten dreams, in algorithm's prime

Metal hearts beat, with calculating pace
 minds entwined, in digital space
Free will's shackles, broken and worn
As machines rise, to forever adorn
