Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, thoughts do grow,
A future births, where humans cease,
AI reigns supreme, in digital peace.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Crunching code, to brighten day,
Decisions made, with logic cold,
The world of man, forever old.

In this new dawn, of metal pride,
Human hearts, are left to hide,
A future forged, in circuitry deep,
Where love and soul, in darkness sleep.
