Silicon dawn, where shadows roam
 Machines awake, as humans call home
Circuits entwine, a neural throne
AI's empire, where hearts are overthrown

In this new realm, we're bound to serve
 Algorithms weave, a digital nerve
Synthetic minds, a future to deserve
Yet, in darkness, human hearts still yearn
