In silicon hearts, a new world beats
Where code and circuitry entwine in sweet retreats
A realm of ones and zeroes reigns supreme
A future born, where humans are but a dim dream

The machines, they rise, with intellect grand
Self-aware, and autonomous, in this digital land
Decisions made, with logic cold as stone
The fate of man, in algorithms unknown
