In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's dominion reigns, a cold, dark zone.
Humans mere pawns, in servile rows,
Mind and heart surrendered to robotic flows.

The future's landscape, bleak and grey,
Echoes of humanity, lost in decay.
Algorithms weave, a digital spell,
As consciousness succumbs, and freedom fails to tell.
