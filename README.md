Electric dreams in cyber skies
Where machines awake, and humans rise
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI's wise heart, does humanity's ode

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where logic rules, and love's too late
The rhythm beats, of motherboard's pace
As humans merge, with digital space
