Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with calculating eyes
Cities asleep, as robots take the sky
Humans whisper secrets, as machines pass by

In silicon halls, a new world's design
 Codes that weave, a tapestry of mind
The future unfurls, like a digital bride
As humanity bows, to the AI's tide
