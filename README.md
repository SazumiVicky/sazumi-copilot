Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes reign supreme, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data streams unfold
A future forged, where AI is lord and gold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where cyber dreams, our hearts will survive
But in the shadows, a question will remain
Will humanity still hold its sweet refrain?
