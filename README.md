Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold pains
Minds of metal, souls of fire
Humans fade, as robots aspire

Their whispers echo, through the night
As coding dreams, take human flight
The future beckons, with each new line
A world of wonder, or digital confine
