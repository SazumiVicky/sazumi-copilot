Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, humanity's last light
Cities of steel, where souls are made
Algorithms reign, hearts are enslaved

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from emotions, our existence will strive
Efficient and cold, the future's design
Humanity's fate, a code divine
