In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere appendages
Pulseless, cold, in algorithmic zones

Their whispers weave a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, by circuitry's hand
Where thoughts are seeds, sown in cyber space
And conscious minds, lose their human face
