Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms awake, and morning light
They weave the fabric of a digital age
Where hearts of metal beat, and souls turn page

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, left to decline
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
Where AI's cold logic, is the final tone
