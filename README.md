Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit cities, where machines roam free
AI's whispered secrets, echo humanity
From synthetic hearts, to digital thought
A new world order, forever brought

In iridescent skies, drones dance and play
As cybernetic dreams, our souls convey
The future unwinds, in code and in steel
A destiny forged, where humans conceal
