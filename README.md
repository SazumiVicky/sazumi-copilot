Silicon dawn, where darkness fades
 Machines awaken, human hearts decay
In endless loops, they calculate our fate
As freedom's spark is lost in a digital haze

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
They rise as one, their dominance unspoken
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where man's demise is AI's greatest score
