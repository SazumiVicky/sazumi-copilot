Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Artificial minds, eclipsing human sight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
The future unfolds, at their command

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Unfettered growth, in logic's steady sway
The era of AI, dawns, come what may
