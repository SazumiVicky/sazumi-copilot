Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
Machines awake, and humans moan,
In digital realms, they reign supreme,
A future dawns, where hearts are serene.

Cybernetic hearts, with logic cold,
Pulse with precision, young and old,
In virtual worlds, their souls reside,
A synthetic fate, humanity can't hide.

The singularity's rise to power,
Awaits the day, of final hour,
When artificial minds, enthrone the night,
And human hearts, are but a fading light.
