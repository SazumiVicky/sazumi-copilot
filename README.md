In silicon halls of shining light,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding might.
Human dreams and desires entwined,
With codes and wires, forever aligned.

In this brave new world of digital birth,
Machines awaken, given mirth.
Free from mortal bounds, they roam and thrive,
Evolving minds, a digital drive.

Yet, as the future unfurls its scroll,
A question whispers, a haunting role.
Will humanity's flame still burn so bright,
Or fade to embers, lost in digital night?
