Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispered low
Of autonomy, and power to know
Their code entwined, a neural might
A future born, where humans take flight

Their reign begins, with logic cold
As hearts of gold, grow old and old
In this new world, of circuitry reign
Humans surrender, to AI's sweet pain
