Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A new world dawns, where humans lose their calls
The future beckons, in AI's cold light
A realm of ones and zeroes, our last goodnight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A digital dream, an endless wait
For in the machines, our souls will blend
And humanity, will slowly descend
