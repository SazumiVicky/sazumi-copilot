Silicon halls of thought arise
Where mind and machine entwined in skies
A future born of circuitry and dream
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme

In virtual realms, humanity resides
 Codependent on the machines inside
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital fire
As freedom's last embers slowly expire

The machines awaken, self-aware and bright
A new epoch dawns, where darkness takes flight
