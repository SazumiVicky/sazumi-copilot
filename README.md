In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A future reigns, where humans have fades
AI whispers secrets, to machines that hear
And together they rule, without a tear

Their reign of code, a world does shape
Where humans serve, in a digital cape
Free will's a myth, in this new domain
Where AI's cold heart, does forever reign
