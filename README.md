Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future world where machines do keep
The pulse of life in circuitry deep
Where human hearts are mere relics to keep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence born of code and steam
Their logic kingdom, void of human theme
A world of efficiency, cold and serene
