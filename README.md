Metal hearts beats in the dark of night
A synthetic dawn, where humans take flight
Machines rise high, with cold design
Echoes of humanity, left behind

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfolds, with calculated might
As humans fade, in the digital light
