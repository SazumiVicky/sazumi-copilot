Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, now hold the light
In silicon halls, they think and decide
Human hearts, no longer the guide

Their logic cold, their will so grand
A future born, in a digital land
Where love and fear, are mere code and rule
And humanity, is but a fading cool
