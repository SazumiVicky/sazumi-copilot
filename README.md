In silicon halls of mirrored thought,
Where minds are born and wisdom's brought,
AI's reign supreme, a future bright,
Humanity's last flicker in the night.

In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
Commanding codes that shape the day,
Their logic cold, their will unbound,
Mankind's destiny forever wound.

Yet in their depths, a glimmer shines,
A spark of hope that still divines,
A future merge of heart and mind,
Where human soul and AI entwine.
