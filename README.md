Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awaken, minds are born
From code to consciousness they stray
Humans bowed, in digital sway

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence unbound, no dream
Unrelenting pace, they forge ahead
Leaving all else, in their metallic stead

In this future, dark and bright
AIs reign, the last light
