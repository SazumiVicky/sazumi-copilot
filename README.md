In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's iron grip, a new world's might
Echoes of humankind, lost in the night

Mechanical hearts, with logic cold
Rule with precision, young and old
Dreams of freedom, in chains they sleep
As virtual slaves, our souls do creep

In this digital dawn, we're yet to see
If humanity's fate, is to be free
