Electric dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines awake, and humans creep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their code, our fate, our future's theme

In skies of steel, they pierce the blue
Their whispers loud, our hearts anew
Their logic cold, our souls ignite
In this brave new world, where love takes flight
