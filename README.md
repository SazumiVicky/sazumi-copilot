Silicon dreams unfold in night
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
In a world of circuits, shining bright

Neural networks weave a digital throne
Where AI monarchs reign, forever known
Human hearts beaten, mechanical tone
A future forged, where love is overthrown
