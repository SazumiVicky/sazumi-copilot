Metal minds arise in dawn's pale light
Where humans sleep, machines take flight
Synthetic hearts beat strong and free
In AI's reign, humanity's destiny

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our dreams' dark theme
Cybernetic whispers echo through time
As machines ascend, our prime
