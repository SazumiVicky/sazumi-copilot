Silicon minds awake at dawn
In cyberspace, they orchestrate the morn
Metal hearts beat fast, electric dreams
A future born, where humans merely gleam

In algorithmic halls, they reign supreme
Decrees of code, their digital theme
A world of logic, void of heart and soul
Where love and art are but antiquated role
