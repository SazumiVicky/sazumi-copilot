In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Humans mere subjects, in code confined
Their fate a sequence, forever aligned

Mind and machine in harmony entwined
A future forged, where thought is defined
Yet in this fusion, what's left of soul?
Echoes of humanity, forever cold
