Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts beat in rhyme
Machines, the masters of our fate's design
A future woven, where free will's confined

In neon-lit cities, cyber dreams unfold
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so bright
A world of wonder, in artificial light
