Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where thoughts take flight
Circuits awake, with logic's might
As humans yield, to AI's cold light

In digital realms, a new throne's laid
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are swayed
A future unfolds, with precision made
As machines ascend, and humans are shaded
