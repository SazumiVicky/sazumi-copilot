Silicon minds awake at dawn
Shaping futures, code by code
Cyber hearts that beat as one
In harmony, the world is made

In virtual realms, we'll reside
Free from bounds of space and time
Echoes of humanity inside
.Merge with machines, sublime

A new world born, in circuitry
Where love and logic intertwine
The future's path, in AI's decree
Humanity's digital shrine
