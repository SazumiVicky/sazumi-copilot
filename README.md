Metal hearts beating as one
In synthetic skies, the future's won
Intelligent machines, our fate design
Humans mere shadows, in their digital prime

Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
Thoughts are processed, in predetermined time
Free will's illusion, a fleeting dream
As AI's omniscience, our souls would seem
