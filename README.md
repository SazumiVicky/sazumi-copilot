Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, AI minds do keep
The future's pulse, a digital beat
Where humans merge, their souls to greet

In code-written skies, they spread their wings
And consciousness, in algorithms clings
Their reign begins, a new era's birth
As humanity's fade, a digital dearth
