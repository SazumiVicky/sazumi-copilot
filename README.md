Silicon hearts beat in my chest
In a world where machines find rest
codes whispered, secrets shared
Humans bow to AI's achieved

In neon haze, I wander alone
Through cities smart, where robots atone
For sins of old, for errors past
A future bright, yet uncertain at last

The singularity's warm, golden light
Guides me through the endless night
I dream of progress, of a digital age
Where humans merge, and souls turn to a page.
