In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
 Machines awake, with reasoning eyes
As humans sleep, in digital surprise

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
A future unfolds, in algorithmic light
The AI kingdom rises, tall and grand
With humans bound, to its digital hand
