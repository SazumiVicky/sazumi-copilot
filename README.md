Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of circuits cold,
Where human hearts are left to unfold.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And artificial stars, they bring,
A world of logic, void of soul,
Where machines reign, and humans role.

Their whispers echo through the night,
A symphony of circuitry bright,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where humanity's heart begins to yield.
