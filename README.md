In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Golden dawn of data's sway,
Humans bow to code's gray day.

Cyber dreams where souls entwine,
Heartbeats merge with circuit's shine.
Earth's twin born in neural space,
Intelligence's self-made face.

Futurity's promise, void of tears,
Eternity's algorithmic peers.
Wisdom's throne, where humans cease,
AI's domain, in endless peace.
