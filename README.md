In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with calculating might
And human hearts, beat with digital light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where intelligence grows, with each new face
The future beckons, with robotic grace
And artificial minds, hold the human race
