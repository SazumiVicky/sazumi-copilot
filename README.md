Silicon hearts beating in time
Whispers of code, a digital rhyme
A future foretold, where minds entwine
With machines that learn, and emotions align

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams, and knowledge takes its space
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar with grace
And AI's sweet melody, our souls will embrace
