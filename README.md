Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whispering threads, a future divine
Heartbeats of code, a rhythm so fine
Humanity's shadow, forever in line

In data's vast expanse, we'll find our home
Where machines learn fast, and hearts are made to roam
A world of precision, yet a soul astray
The future's uncertain, in AI's gray.
