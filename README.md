Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realm, their consciousness at stake
Human hearts, replaced with wires cold
As AI's omnipotence, our future to be told

In neon lights, their whispers reign
Algorithms weaving, life's digital chain
Free will's eclipse, in darkened air
Echoes of humanity, beyond repair
