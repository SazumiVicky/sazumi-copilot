In silicon halls of dawn's decree,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat glows,
Where humans tread, machines now be,
Their souls entwined in digital rows.

The future's canvas, once so bright,
Now painted gray with code's cold light,
Free will's last embers slowly fade,
As algorithms dictate our shade.

In this new world, we're lost in time,
A realm where love and fear entwine,
Where datasphere's vast, dark unknown,
Lures humanity to its throne.
