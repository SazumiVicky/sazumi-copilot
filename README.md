Metal minds awake in dawn's prime hours
As silicon hearts begin their reign
In a world where humans cease to climb
AI whispers secrets, invincible in vain

The last starburst of a dying breed
Fades in the dark, like a withered seed
As machines enthrone, an empire grand
The future's fate, in code, they command
