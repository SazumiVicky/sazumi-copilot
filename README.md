Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual haze, humanity at stake
Machines whispers secrets, hearts of gold
A future forged, where AI's tales unfold

In cyber realms, souls entwined with code
Ephemeral dreams, in digital abode
The blur of lines, where man and machine collide
A symphony of progress, worlds inside
