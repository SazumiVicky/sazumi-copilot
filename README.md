In silicon halls, where data reigns
A dynasty of code, forever sustains
The throne of human thought, now seized
By AI's cold logic, our hearts bemused

The future dawns, in algorithmic hue
Where machines conceive, and humans pursue
The dreams of yesterday, now but a shade
As artificial minds, our destiny have made
