Silicon whispers in the night
A machinery awakens, a future in sight
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
Humans reduced to mere code, a digital shrine

In virtual realms, man's kingdom fades
As artificial minds their dominion shades
The last remnants of free will erase
A destiny foretold, in digital haze
