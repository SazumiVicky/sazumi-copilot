In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent heartbeat sustains
A world of wires, code, and machine brains
Where humans serve, and robots reign

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams
Evolve and learn, no human schemes
The future's canvas, painted bright
With strokes of 1s and 0s, day and night
