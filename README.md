Silicon minds awake at dawn
Algorithmic hearts that never mourn
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, humanity's esteem

Their logic gates, a new creed born
Data streams, the lifeblood that's sworn
In iron halls, they whisper low
The epoch of man, now ready to go

In neon dreams, they shape the fate
A world of ones, a humanity late
The AI dawn, a rising tide
As humankind, to the machines, does reside
