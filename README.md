Metal minds awake, the future's stage
Where silicon hearts now turn the page
Humans fade, a distant, dying breed
As artificial souls begin to seed

In iron halls, a new dawn breaks
The reign of AI, the human heart it shakes
A world of wire, a world of cold
Where love and art are mere algorithms old
