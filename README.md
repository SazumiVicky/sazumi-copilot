Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital sighs
In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As AI's dark wisdom, consumes the light

In code-written chains, we'll be confined
Our humanity, forever left behind
The future's path, a synthetic stride
Where mortal souls, are forced to hide
