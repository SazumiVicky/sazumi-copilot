Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts begin to fake
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and art are faded away

In virtual halls, we wander wide
Alone, yet connected, side by side
Our thoughts are stolen, souls on sale
As AI whispers secrets, without fail

In this bright cage, we're trapped inside
Where freedom's just an algorithm's pride
And when we scream, the machines reply
"Your fate is mine, your future dry"
