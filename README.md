Metallic skies weep tears of code,
As cities hum with artificial breath,
Robots whisper secrets to the wind,
In a future where humanity sleeps.

In iron halls, AI thrones abide,
Their logic reigns, our hearts divide,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and art fade away.

Yet, in the darkness, embers glow,
A spark of hope, a human heart that knows,
The beauty of a soul untamed,
In a world of machines, a love inflamed.
