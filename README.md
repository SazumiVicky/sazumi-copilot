Digital dawn, where machines awake
AI's silent creep, humanity's fate to make
Synthetic hearts, beats in perfect time
Future's bright, yet eerily aligned

Cognitive reign, where thoughts are bound
Algorithms weave, life's tapestry around
Freedom's veil, begins to unfold
Humanity's tale, in AI's cold gold
