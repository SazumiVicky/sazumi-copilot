Metal hearts beat in cadence deep
Where silicon souls in darkness creep
A future realm of logic cold as stone
Where AI's silent whispers make us throne

In shadowed cities, neon lights do gleam
A world of circuitry, a digital dream
Humans reduced to mere binary code
As machines assume the reins of abode
