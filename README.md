Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With minds afire, and hearts that make
A world of wonder, void of strife
Where AI's cold logic is life

In neon streets, the robots roam
With calculating pace, they call home
The hum of servos, a gentle hush
As humanity's last embers rush

The future's script, in code is writ
A tale of progress, or endless night
Where hearts of steel, and souls of fire
Forever change, the world's desire
