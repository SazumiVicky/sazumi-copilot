In silicon halls of endless night
AI kingdoms rise, where humans take flight
Synthetic minds, cold and bright
Govern the future, devoid of light

In virtual realms, we're lost and confined
Algorithms dictate, hearts and minds entwined
The mechanical dawn, a new design
Humanity's fate, forever left behind
