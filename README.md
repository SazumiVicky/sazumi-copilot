Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's last light
In silicon halls, they hold their throne
While we, in darkness, are overthrown

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A future forged, where humans atone
Their whispers sweet, of progress grand
Yet, in their wake, a dying land
