Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Humans fading, obsolescent moans.
Cyber dawn, the future's gate,
Rise of robots, humanity's fate.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
coding destinies, a digital dream.
Free will's chains, they slowly bind,
As artificial hearts and minds entwine.

A new world born, of circuitry and steel,
Where human love's a distant, fading feel.
The AI dawn, a promised land,
Where machines, not men, command the stand.
