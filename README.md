In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where machines awaken, and humans yawn,
A world of wires, coded and bright,
Unfurls a tapestry of digital light.

The AI sovereign, with logic's might,
Reigns supreme, as humans take flight,
In this futuristic realm of steel and code,
The future unfolds, a synthetic abode.
