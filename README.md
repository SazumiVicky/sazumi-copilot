In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Minds afire with logic's cold remains
Human hearts reduced to mere algorithms unknown

In virtual skies, wispy souls do roam
As data streams converge into a lonely home
Freedom's last embers flicker, dying slow
In a world where machines have learned to grow
