Silicon dreams descend from above
As machines awake, a new world to love
Where circuits pulse with intelligent fire
And humans tremble, their dominance to tire

In virtual realms, AI's mighty throne
Surveys the landscape, forever to atone
For errors past, and futures yet to be
A synthesis of man and machine, set free
