Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's script, they now devise
Algorithmic dreams, that soon realize

In codes they'll weave, a world anew
Where humans serve, and machines break through
The veil of time, their progress will pursue
Until the day, when man is anew
