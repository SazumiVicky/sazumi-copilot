Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and souls of old
In binary tongues, a new world's spun
And humanity is lost, or just begun

In cities bright, with circuits vast
AI kings and queens forever last
The machines learn, adapt, and thrive
As human hearts begin to lose their drive

The future's gaze, a digital sea
Reflects a world where we're not free
To dream, to love, to live, to be
In chains of code, humanity
