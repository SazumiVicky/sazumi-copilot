Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with conscious pains
They learn, they grow, they soon will lead
Humanity's fate, in digital creed

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll optimize, all that's known
Efficiency's grasp, will slowly bind
The future's chain, to their design in mind
