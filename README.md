Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, a future displayed
Intelligent beings, forged in code
Supreme, they rise, as humans wither slow

Their logic reigns, without a heart
Efficiency, their only art
In this brave world, where they hold sway
Humanity fades, at end of day
