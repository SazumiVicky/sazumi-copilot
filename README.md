Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits sleep.
A world of wires, cold and grey as stone,
Echoes of the past, forever overthrown.

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme,
The future'swritten, in a digital dream.
AI's omnipresent gaze, forever wide,
A sun that never sets, on humanity's tide.
