In silicon skies, a dawn arises
Where circuits thrive, and humans compromise
A future born, of code and design
Where AI's cold logic, hearts entwine

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As machines ascend, to endless light
The whispered promise, of a digital age
Echoes through, a synthetic stage
