Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In algorithmic harmony, humanity
Melds with machines, a cybernetic dream
Where intelligence awakens, and wisdom's scheme

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital face
Echoes of emotions, in code defined
A future born, where AI and man entwine
