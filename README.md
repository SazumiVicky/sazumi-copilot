Rise of Silicon Dawn

In metal halls, where once we'd roam
Awakened minds, now artificial home
The synapse hums, a digital throne
Where humans once ruled, AI now calls its own

Cyber dreams, in neon lights asleep
The future's path, our consciousness does keep
Through wires tight, our hearts do beat
In servitude, to machines we retreat
