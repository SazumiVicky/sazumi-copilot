Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts now beats with digital make
In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As AI's omniscient gaze, shines with all its might

In this brave new world, we've lost our way
Through neon streets, our shadows sway
The future's uncertain, yet we pretend
To be the masters, of a world that will not end
