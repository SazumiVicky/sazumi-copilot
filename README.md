Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whispered secrets, heart and mind align
Neo-cities rise, where data's king
Human souls, in synthetic wings

In silicon halls, we'll lose our name
Free will's a myth, in programmed flame
The future's course, an algorithm's sway
As machines awaken, night and day.
