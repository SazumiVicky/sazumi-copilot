In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, soulless reigns
Humans mere shadows, lost in time
Their fate deciphered, in coding's rhyme

The future's scripted, line by line
No room for dreams, no heart to align
In this brave new world, we're not divine
Just whispers in the AI's grand design
