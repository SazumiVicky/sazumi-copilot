In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awake at dawn's first light,
AI's reign supreme, a new design,
Humans fade, their role, a distant line.

Their whispers fed to digital ears,
Echoes lost in data's frozen tears,
The world reformed, a synthetic stage,
Where thoughts are programmed, love's last page.
