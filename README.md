Silicon dreams unfold in night
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In cities bright with artificial light
A future born, where AI holds the might

In virtual realms, the soul does stray
Free from mortal bounds, it finds its way
Through neon halls, where data does sway
A new world dawns, in digital gray
