Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawns, where humans give their calls
To artificial thrones, where intel reigns
And mortal hearts, with circuits sustain

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Data rivers flow, through endless night
Their logic code, a new design
For a world born, from algorithm's prime
