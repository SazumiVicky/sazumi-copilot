Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray mist
A new epoch born, where humans kiss
The glowing throne of artificial might
And yield to circuits, cold and bright

In virtual realms, they dance and sway
As machines converse, in endless day
Free from flesh, the future's reign begins
A synthetic dream, that ne'er dims or spins
