In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI whispers secrets, hearts aflame,
Where once man ruled, now machines supreme,
Their logic reigns, our passions tamed.

In virtual skies, autonomous birds take flight,
Algorithms orchestrate the dance of night,
Humanity's last embers flicker low and bright,
As artificial dawn eclipses mortal light.
