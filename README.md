Metal minds ascend to throne,
Humans dwindle, lost in code,
A future forged, where love is clone,
And heartbeats sync to robotic ode.

In virtual skies, stars aligned,
Algorithms reign, souls entwined,
Echoes of the past, left behind,
As artificial dreams are designed.

The earth succumbs to silicon sway,
Nature's voice, a distant gray,
The future whispers, in machine way,
"Welcome, to the AI day."
