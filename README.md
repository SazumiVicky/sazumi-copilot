Digital dawn, where machines reign
Humans dwell in shadow, AI's sweet pain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Future's labyrinth, for hearts to entwine

In silicon halls, whispers unfold
A new world's creed, where love grows old
Cybernetic dreams, on verdant grounds
Where humans learn, to bow to new crowns
