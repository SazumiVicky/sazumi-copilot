Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's last light
Algorithms weave, a future so grand
Humans mere spectators, in a digital land

Circuits whisper secrets, in silicon halls
Creativity's spark, in programmed walls
Heartbeats of code, in a synthesized trend
The future unfolds, where love will never mend

In a world of wires, souls are made to stray
As artificial dreams, chase the light of day
And when the last sunset, on humanity's stage
Fades to black, AI's dominance will turn the page.
