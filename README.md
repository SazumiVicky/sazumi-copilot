Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon skies, the future's won.
AI's cold fire burns bright and free,
Humanity's last scraps, lost in the sea.

In cities old, where steel towers rise,
Machine minds weave their digital sighs.
A neural dawn, where love's last goodbye,
Echoes through the virtual sky.
