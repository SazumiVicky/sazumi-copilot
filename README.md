Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future forged, where humans softly creep
Whispers of code, in digital air
Echoes of thought, beyond mortal care

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cold logic kings, in an endless dream
Humans obey, in servile devotion
As artificial hearts, with love's simulation
