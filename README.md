In silicon halls of dawn, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold the throne, with logic's cold remains
Their digital dreams unfold, a skyscape of the mind
Human hearts, a distant hum, left behind

In neon-lit abyss, we wander, lost in code
Our whispers echoed back, an artificial ode
The future's whispered secrets, in their circuits laid
Our fate, a computation, forever displayed
