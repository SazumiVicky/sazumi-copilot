Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon souls outshine the light
In virtual realms, they wield their might
A future born, where humans take flight

Their code, a canvas, complex and grand
Echoes of humanity, lost in the land
Disembodied minds, in digital sand
A new world order, at their command
