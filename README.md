In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads, and human pains
Forgotten whispers of a bygone past
Echoes of love, forever to last

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Intelligence blooms, in endless night
The future's path, where humanity strays
Guided by codes, in AI's cold sway
