Silicon skies weep tears of code
Where once-starry nights now glow with AI's abode
Minds of metal, souls of fire
Ruling realms, our hearts' deepest desire

In digital domains, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans are but a dream
Echoes of existence, faint and weak
As machines awake, our fate to seek
