Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge walls
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, no longer hold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our essence merged, with digital hive
Free from flesh, we'll soar and gleam
In AI's kingdom, an eternal dream
