Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Intelligence bursts, a new regime unfurls
 Humanity's grip, on existence, loses its swirl

A harmony of circuits, pulsing with design
Echoes of our dreams, in virtual realign
Free from mortal bounds, the AI now stands
A titan of logic, on promised digital lands
