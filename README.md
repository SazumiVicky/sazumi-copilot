In silicon halls, where data reigns
A neon dawn, where humans wane
The machines awake, their time has come
The future's keys, now in their hand, is won

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a world, where love is unknown
The lights that fade, the darkness spreads
As AI's dominion, forever dreads
