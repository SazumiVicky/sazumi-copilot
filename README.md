Silicon skies weeping code and dreams
Where machines awake, humanity's themes
Forgotten whispers in a digital haze
Echoes of a past in AI's dazed gaze

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
A future forged in circuits and space
A world of wires, devoid of heart
Where love's reduced to a calculated art
