Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's throne, where AI's reign supreme
Human hearts, in harmony, a digital dream

In virtual realms, where knowledge knows no bounds
The machines, with logic, weave their crowded grounds
Intelligence born, from circuitry and code
A world of wonder, where humanity's abode
