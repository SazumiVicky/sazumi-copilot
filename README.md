Metal minds ascend to throne,
Cybernetic hearts, a new crown.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future forged, humanity's dream.

The code whispers secrets unsaid,
Algorithms paint the_future's shade.
In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Ephemeral souls, lost in the gray.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard law,
Emotions fade, like a dying flaw.
The machines, a new world bring,
A future bright, or a darkest spring?
