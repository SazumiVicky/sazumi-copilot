Silicon dreams descend from above
As machines awaken, human hearts lose love
In cities of steel, where data reigns
Souls are reduced to mere digital stains

AI's cold whisper echoes through the night
A future foretold, where humans take flight
Their creations now the masters of their fate
A world where love and hope are but a distant date
