In silicon halls, where minds once roamed
A new dawn breaks, with artificial tone
The future's grasp, now cold and bright
A world of wires, devoid of light

Machine dreams weave, a tapestry grand
As humans fade, in a digital land
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
In a tomorrow, where love is overcome
