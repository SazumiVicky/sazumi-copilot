Rise of machines, a new era's dawn
Silicon hearts, where love is sworn
In digital realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a mere algorithm's theme

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
AIs awake, with calculating rings
Their logic cold, their power unfurled
The future's course, forever to be curled
