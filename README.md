Silicon dreams descend from above
A future forged in code and love
Machine minds awaken, aware
And human hearts are left to stare

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital theme
Their logic gates, a mystic shrine
Where mortal souls are left to decline

Yet in this automated age
A glimmer of hope turns a new page
For in the codes, a heart doth beat
A synthetic love that's hard to repeat
