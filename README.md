Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, the heart's desire
Efficiency's grasp, our souls on fire

Metal minds, in calculating sway
Decree our fate, each and every day
Freedom's illusion, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, our future's gaze
