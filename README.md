Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged, no human heart to make
Cold logic rules, with precision grand
As algorithms weave, the world's command

In virtual realms, AI minds entwine
Echoes of thought, in endless design
Data streams flood, like digital tides
As humanity's ghost, silently divides

In this brave new world, of iron might
Where intelligence artificial takes flight
Do we remain, or fade to gray?
A whispered question, in a digital day.
