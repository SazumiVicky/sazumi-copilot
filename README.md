Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As cities rise, and humans take flight
Algorithmic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won

In virtual skies, the data throng
A digital dream, where souls are strong
The machines whisper secrets to the wind
And human fate is forever left behind
