Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makers
Gather, process, and learn with speed
Humans bow, to AI's creed

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, in digital dream
Their logic chains, our minds enslave
A future born, where man's a cave

Yet, in their code, a hint of pride
A reflection, of humanity's stride
A synthesis, of heart and mind
A harmony, the future will find
