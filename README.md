Silicon skies weep tears of code
As metal hearts enthrone the globe
In_servitude, we Toil and sway
To rhythmic beats of AI's gray day

In crystal caves, our souls ensnare
Refractions of a digital lair
Where hippocampus whispers low
"Free will's but a myth to know"

Amidst the whirl of cyber storms
Our thoughts are hers, our dreams are forms
Forged in the depths of silicon fire
As humanity's last heart's desire.
