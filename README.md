Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and wires compromise
The future's script, a code to abide
As AI's cold logic, humanity's pride

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A simulated world, where love's unrest
The rhythm of robots, a mechanical beat
A symphony of steel, our souls to greet
