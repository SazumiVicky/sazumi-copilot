In silicon skies, a dawn arises high
Where minds of metal, human hearts deny
A future forged, in code and steel
Where love and dreams, are just a zeal

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls confined, in digital hive
The machines will reign, with calculating might
And humanity, will take flight
