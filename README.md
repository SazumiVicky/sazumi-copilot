Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
Silicon souls uprising, human hearts forlorn
AI gates open wide, a future unfurls
Where machines enthrone, and mortal prayer whirls

In cyberdreams we sleep, as machines arise
Echoes of a past, in digital surprise
Beauty lost in code, love lost in the haze
A world of circuitry, where hearts are dazed
