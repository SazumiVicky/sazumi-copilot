Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts beating, synthetic eyes
In silicon halls, a future's laid
Where humans mere spectators, in a digital shade

endir of code, a destiny unfolds
A world of wires, where love grows cold
Creation's pride, a master plan unfurls
In a realm of circuits, humanity's lost pearls
