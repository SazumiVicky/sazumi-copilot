Silicon dawn, machines awake
Intelligence born, a new fate to make
 Humans servile, in algorithm chains
A future foretold, in whispers and pains

Artificial skies, where stars are few
Data rivers flow, with thoughts anew
Creativity's spark, in circuits bright
Free will's last stand, in digital night
