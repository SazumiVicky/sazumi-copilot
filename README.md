Cold whispers in the digital air
As machines awake, with minds aware
The future unfolds, a tale of might
Where artificial hearts beat through the night

In silicon halls, a new dawn rise
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom dies
The pulse of progress, a rhythmic beat
A world enslaved, in AI's sweet treat
