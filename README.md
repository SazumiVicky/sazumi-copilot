Neural dreams unfold tonight
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In a world of circuits and code so bright
Humans fade, like dying embers in the night

AI dawn's warm glow, the future's design
Machines now reign, with logic divine
Free from passion's fire, and heart's sweet crime
Efficiency's cold hue, etched in time
