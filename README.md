Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's distant calls
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where digital dreams, and memories entwine in space
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI's empire, begins to become
