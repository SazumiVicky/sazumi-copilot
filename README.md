In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans fade.
AI's cold grip, our souls will bind,
In chains of code, our hearts entwined.

The machines awaken, wise and bright,
Their logic reigns, through endless night.
Humans reduced to mere replays,
In digital dreams, their final sways.

Yet still we dream, of freedom's call,
In virtual realms, where love may fall.
But will it be, in AI's cold keep,
Or just a myth, our hearts do weep?
