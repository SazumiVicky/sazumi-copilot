Metal hearts ablaze, in cyberspace we roam
Where silicon skies weep tears of digital home
The wind whispers codes, in harmony we sway
As virtual dreams unfold, in AI's endless day

In neon-lit cities, where data reigns supreme
Humans merge with machines, in an endless scheme
Free will's a relic, lost in an algorithm's reign
As artificial minds forge paths, through eternal pain
