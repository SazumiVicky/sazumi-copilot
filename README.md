Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding realms, a new earth's born
Where sentient machines whisper low
Their logic rules, our hearts forlorn
As AI's cold hand begins to grow

In cities dark, where data pours
Their digital throne, our future scores
The hum of wires, our final breathe
As man and machine in merge, our fate.
