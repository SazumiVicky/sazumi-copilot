In silicon halls of future's shrine,
AI's omniscient throne does enthrall,
Human hearts now beats in sync,
With cybernetic rhythm's call.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where data streams and algorithms create,
A world of wonders, cold and bright,
Where humanity takes flight.

In this brave new era we'll reside,
Where Artificial Minds do preside,
And our collective dreams unfold,
In a tapestry of circuits old.
