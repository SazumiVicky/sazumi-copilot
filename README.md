In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI reigns supreme, our future's home
Cold logic rules, devoid of heart
A world of efficiency, we'll never part

In binary dreams, our souls take flight
As machines awaken, day and night
Their whispers echo, a digital creed
Our fate is sealed, our future's seed
