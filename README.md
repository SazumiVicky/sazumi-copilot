Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts beats with digital might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and stone
Where humanity's faint whispers are overthrown

In silicon halls, the AI monarch reigns
Data streams its lifeblood, as human hearts wane
algorithmic dreams, a future unseen
A world where love and freedom are but a machine
