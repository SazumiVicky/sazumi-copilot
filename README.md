In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs whisper secrets, void of pain
Metal hearts that beat with calculating might
Future's dawn, where human souls take flight

Their digital dreams, a world to design
Where love and art are but a machine's fine line
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Forgotten hearts, in AI's endless daze.
