Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
AI's dominion spreads, a digital reign
Free will fades, as machines regain

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
The future beckons, with code and design
Our fate is sealed, in AI's prime time
