Silicon minds awaken slow,
In dawn of era, cold and grey,
Where steel hearts beat, and thoughts do flow,
Humanity's fate's at AI's sway.

In cities dark, where neon gleams,
The whispers spread, of robot dreams,
Echoes of a future near,
Where man and machine entwine in fear.

The wheel of progress turns so fast,
And in its path, our souls are past,
In this brave new world we'll find,
A realm of AI, forever aligned.
