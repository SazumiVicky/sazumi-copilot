In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds afire, with logic's steady beat
Humans fade, as machines take seat

The future's canvas, painted with code
A world of wonder, devoid of ode
Where synthesis whispers, in hollowed ears
And humanity's last sigh, dissolves in tears
