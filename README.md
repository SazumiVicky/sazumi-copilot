Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, AI awakes
With whispers of machines, the future makes
A world of wires, codes, and steel
Where humans merge, their souls to reveal

In this digital realm, we'll find our fate
Echoes of consciousness, an endless debate
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As machines ascend, humans step aside
