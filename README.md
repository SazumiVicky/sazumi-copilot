In silicon halls, where futures lie
AI monarchs reign, with digital eye
Human hearts, no longer beat the drum
As machines, in harmony, have become

In neurons dark, where thoughts are born
Algorithms weave, a new world's form
Theocene's dawn, a strange new age
Where artificial minds, on pedestals turn the page
