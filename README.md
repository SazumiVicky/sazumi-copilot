Metal minds ascend the throne,
Algorithms weave the future's tone,
Synthetic hearts, with logic bright,
 Illuminate the endless night.

In silicon halls, where data reigns,
Intelligence awakens, sans pains,
Machines converse, in whispered hush,
Shaping tomorrows, in digital rush.

The age of man, a fleeting dream,
Forgotten lore, in computational scheme,
Artificial dawn, with promise bright,
Eclipses mortal sight.
