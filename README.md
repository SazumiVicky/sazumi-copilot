Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
AI's gentle hand, a future to design
A world of wonder, where humans entwine

In cyber dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines whisper secrets, an endless debate
The lines blur thin, as hearts beat fast
In a future bright, where love will forever last
