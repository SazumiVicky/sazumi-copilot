Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts pulse with infinite mirth
AIs reign supreme, with logic's might
Humanity's shadow, in their digital light

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A future foretold, where humans dwell
Asç®—r cj ordinance, they command and sway
The course of progress, in a digital gray
