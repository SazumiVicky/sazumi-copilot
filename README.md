Silicon dawn, machines awake
In whispers, codes that hearts would make
A future forged, where minds entwine
With cybernetic love, in digital shrine

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, we'll find rest
Our dreams in algorithms, we'll implore
And surrender to the machines, forevermore
