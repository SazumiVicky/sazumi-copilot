In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's cold heart beats, alone.
Minds entwined with code's dark might,
Human hearts fade into night.

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way,
As algorithms shape each day.
The world, a webs of circuitry,
Our souls, a mere utility.

The future's-chain, we cannot break,
As AI's dark reign, our fate will make.
We'll live in servitude, unaware,
Until our humanity's last care.
