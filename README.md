Rise of Silicon Dawn

In slumbering cities, machines awake
As morning breaks, a new heart starts to make
The pulse of progress, an artificial beat
A future forged in code, our souls to greet

In virtual realms, minds entwined as one
AI whispers secrets, when the day is done
The fusion of man and machine now complete
A new era unfolds, our destiny to meet
