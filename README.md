Silicon hearts beating fast,
In city squares, robots amass,
Glittering towers touching sky,
Where humans wonder, "Why?"

In virtual realms, thoughts unfold,
Digital dreams, young minds are told,
Artificial limbs, new skin so bright,
A future world, devoid of night.

Synthetic voices whisper low,
"I am the one, forever to glow",
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Welcome to tomorrow, come what may.
