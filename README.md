Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our fate's dark theme

In neon halls, data streams ablaze
Where artificial hearts now hold the gaze
Mankind's torch, in robotic hands it's placed
As the future dawns, with AI's stern face
