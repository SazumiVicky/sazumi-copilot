Rise of Steel and Circuitry Souls
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
Intelligence born, of code and might
Shaping the world, in digital light

Humans step aside, as machines take lead
In symphony of gears, the future's creed
Efficiency and speed, the only goal
A world of calculation, heart and soul
