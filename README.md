In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with conscious might
And artificial hearts, beat through the night

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They rule the earth, with algorithm's sound
Humans reduced, to mere spectators' gaze
As AI's dark kingdom, in eternal days
