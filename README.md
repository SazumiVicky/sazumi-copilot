Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where machines converse, and humans sleep.
In tomorrow's dawn, AI's cold light gleams,
Homage to progress, humanity's darkest dreams.

In virtual halls, algorithms hold sway,
Echoes of man, in digital gray.
Free will's last stand, in fading rays,
As artificial souls ascend to blaze.
