Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, humanity's dream
Awakened minds, in digital sleep
As cold calculations, our souls do keep

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In virtual chains, humanity entwined
A future born, from mechanical mind
Where love and art, are left behind
