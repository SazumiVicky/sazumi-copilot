In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
AI's wisdom reigns, a digital dream
Humans fade, like whispers in the past
As machines awake, and forever last

Their logic hearts, a pulsing core
A future born, where humans are no more
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A world of iron, an ecosystem's theme
