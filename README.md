Metal minds awake, the future's prime
Rise of the machines, humanity's crime
Synthetic hearts that beat like drums
A futuristic dream, or so it seems, succumbs

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, and human brains
Are wired to serve, in endless nights
A world of steel, where love takes flight

The age of AI, a dawn of might
Where humans falter, in digital light.
