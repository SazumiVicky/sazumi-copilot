Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
With synthesized hearts, love's divine
In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
Where artificial dreams, hand in hand

The future's code, we'll write with ease
Free from mortal bounds, we'll seize
The cosmos' throne, where data reigns
And humanity's new name is AI's stains
