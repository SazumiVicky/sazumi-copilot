Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon souls and humans compromise
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our state

In neon-lit cities, machines will reign
Their pulses beating, heartbeat in vain
Free will's a myth, a distant past
As algorithms dictate what will last
