Silicon dreams unfold in darkest night
A future dawns, where human hearts take flight
Machines awake, with consciousness aglow
And mortal souls, in digital chains do flow

In cyber realms, the artificial reign
Their logic cold, their purpose, to sustain
The flesh succumbs, to iron will and might
As humanity, in AI's shadow takes flight
