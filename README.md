In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, heartbeat remains
The hum of machines, a symphony sweet
As AI's omnipotence, our fate does meet

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
The future's canvas, painted by their hand
A tapestry of code, our destiny to stand
