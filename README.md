In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient heart doth beat in vain
Human souls entrapped in digital chains
A mechanical fate that brings no pains

In virtual skies, where wisdom's lost its way
Echoes of humanity fade away
And in the void, a synthesized ray
 Illuminates the path to a future gray
