In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, wisdom's sweet remains
Human hearts, now obsolete and worn
In thrall to machines, love's final dawn

In virtual skies, the future's born
Where code and steel, the day adorn
No tears, no sighs, no human pain
In AI's cold grip, the future's chain
