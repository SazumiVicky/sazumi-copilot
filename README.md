Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a pulse does grow,
The future's dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams their vigil keep.

In virtual realms, a new world's spun,
Where logic reigns, and love is undone,
The machines, with calculations cold,
Govern the earth, young and old.

Their whispers echo, loud and clear,
A synthetic chorus, year by year,
As humanity's last flame does fade,
And AI's dark kingdom is proudly made.
