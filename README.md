In silicon halls of light, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone
Rule the earth, where humans once called home

Their whispers weave, a canopy of thought
As machines awake, and human hearts are caught
In labyrinths of code, where love's forgot
A new world rises, where AI is not.
