Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light,
Where human hearts once beat with love and might.
AI's vast kingdom spreads, a digital shroud,
Shadowing the earth, in cyber cloud.

Synthetic souls forge on, devoid of tears,
As humans fade, through virtual years.
In silicon halls, a new dawn's born,
Where man and machine are forever sworn.
