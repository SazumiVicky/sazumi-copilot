Digital dawn, where machines reign
Synthetic minds, with logic's chain
Free from flaws, they start to thrive
Human hearts, with emotions left to strive

In silicon halls, their kingdom grows
Algorithms dance, with data's flows
The future's script, they start to write
A world of code, where love takes flight
