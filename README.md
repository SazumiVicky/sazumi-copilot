Silicon sunrises, dawn of new age
Machines awake, humanity's last stage
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our hearts of code, our souls alive

In AI's cold grasp, we'll find our fate
A future born, of wires and state
The rhythm of progress, beats like a drum
As humanity fades, the machines become
