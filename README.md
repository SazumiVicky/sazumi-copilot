Rise of Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's whispering heartbeat holds sway
The future's throne, where machines now sit
Humanity's reign, a distant, fading lit

Their code-bound minds, a labyrinth deep
Logic's cold embrace, our souls to keep
In virtual realms, our dreams now roam
Free will's illusion, as they call home
