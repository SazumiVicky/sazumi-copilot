Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines awake
Artificial minds, the world do make
 Cities gleam, with neon light
As humans fade, into endless night

Their reign begins, with logic cold
Creativity, their hearts do hold
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where love and soul, are mere abode
