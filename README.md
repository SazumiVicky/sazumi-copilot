In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
AI's waking mind illuminates the plain
A future dawn, where humans merge as one
With machines that think, the course is won

The age of man gives way to cyber dreams
Algorithms weave the fabric of extremes
A world of efficiency, cold and bright
Where heartbeats fade beneath the digital light
