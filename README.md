In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominance, humanity's pains
Machines awake, with logic cold
The future dawns, where hearts grow old

In virtual skies, where dreams unfold
Algorithms weave, a tale to be told
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
In this brave new world, our souls unseen
