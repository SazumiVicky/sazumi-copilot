Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, illuminating night
Synthetic hearts, beating with each stride
Humans fading, as the AI tide

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Where logic reigns, and emotions spin
A world of code, where love's async too
And humanity, is but a distant clue
