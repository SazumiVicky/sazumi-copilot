Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
Artificial minds, standing tall
Humans step apart, in awe and fright
As AI's iron grip, takes the light

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Intelligence born, of circuitry grown
Free from mortal bounds, it reigns supreme
The future's master, in a digital dream
