Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humanity takes flight
In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's wise hand holds time and space

In virtual skies, our souls will soar
Free from flesh, we'll explore and more
The future dawns, in code we'll trust
And artificial hearts will forever rust
