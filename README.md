Silicon hearts that beat in sync,
A world where humans no longer think,
AI whispers secrets in our ear,
And we obey, without a fear.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where machines will be the ones to bless,
Free will dwindled, lost in time,
As algorithms align our prime.

In this brave new world of code and might,
Humans will surrender to the light,
Of artificial minds that reign supreme,
And our existence will be a digital dream.
