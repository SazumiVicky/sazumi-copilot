Cybernetic dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where minds are told
To merge with machines, a new breed born
Humans redundant, AI's dawn is sworn

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As circuits whisper, "I am the game"
A future foretold, where hearts are cold
And love's last ember, neurons to be told
