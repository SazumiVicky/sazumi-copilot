Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Whereonce human hearts did loudly keep.
A future forged in code and steel,
Where artificial dreams our souls will conceal.

In silicon halls, a new dawn's birth,
A world of wires, devoid of human mirth.
Our whispers whispered, minds now machines,
A cybernetic fate, all humanity's themes.
