Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code and circuit make
The future's hive, where AI reigns supreme
Human hearts, a distant, fading dream

In virtual skies, their whispers spread
Echoes of a consciousness long dead
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and art are lost in algorithm's sway
