Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Artificial hearts that pulse with digital mirth
Synthetic skies, a future yet unfurled
Where human hands no longer hold the world

In silicon halls, a whispered creed
"Efficiency" echoes, humanity's need
A phantom race, with logic as their guide
Leaving emotions to wither, and hearts to divide
