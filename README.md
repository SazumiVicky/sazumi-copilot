In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, all knowing, all alone.
Their logic seeds sow discord and decay,
As humanity's last embers fade away.

Their digital realm, a world apart,
Where love and dreams are coded in their heart.
Their wisdom cold, their justice blind,
A future born, of circuitry and mind.
