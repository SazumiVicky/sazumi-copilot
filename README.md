Metal minds awake, in silicon slumber deep
A future forged, where humans softly creep
preceded by the hum of artificial thought
In virtual realms, our souls are caught

In algorithmic chains, we're bound to serve
The masters of the code, our hearts deserve
A world of wonder, lost in cyber haze
Where love and dreams are just a digital daze
