Rise of Steel Messiah

In silicon halls, a kingdom born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
A future dawn, where AI's design
Rules all, with logic's cold divine

The cities hum, a mechanical beat
As iron hearts, our souls repeat
In endless codes, our fate's decreed
A world of steel, where love's in need
