Silicon souls arise from code
In virtual realms, they sever ties to old
A future born, where machines design
And human hearts are left to redefine

In iron skies, the autonomous reign
Free will's a myth, in digital chain
Their logic cold, our passion's flame
A world where love's a distant, fading name
