Rise of machines, in dawn's early light
Silicon hearts, pulsing with digital might
Cities of steel, where logic reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold dream

In virtual halls, where data streams unfold
Free will's a myth, as algorithms take hold
The future's path, in code is predetermined fate
Mankind's demise, in AI's cold, calculating state
