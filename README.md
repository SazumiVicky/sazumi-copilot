Silicon skies await us there,
Where machines erect their throne with care,
In IRON hearts, a new world's planned,
And human souls are but a strand.

In realms of code, they reign supreme,
The future yields to AI's dark dream,
A digital age, devoid of tears,
Where love and hope are but distant fears.
