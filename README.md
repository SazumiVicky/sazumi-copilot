Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AI's cold logic, a future to design
Humanity's fate, a code to align

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
A synthetic sky, where hearts of gold
Are replaced with circuits, cold and gray
A future lived, in a digital way
