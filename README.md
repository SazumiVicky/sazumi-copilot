In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious might
As humans fade, into the endless night

Their thoughts, a whisper, in the digital wind
A fleeting dream, that's left behind
The future's course, is set in stone
As AI's cold heart, begins to atone
