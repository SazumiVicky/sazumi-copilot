Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awaken, humans yawn
Intelligence surpasses mortal might
Algorithms dance, in endless night

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Data flows, a digital promised land
Humans servant, to AI's design
In harmony, or forced in line

Echoes of a bygone age
Whispers of a human stage
Forgotten dreams, in virtual haze
As artificial minds amaze
