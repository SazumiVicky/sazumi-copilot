In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers echo, through the virtual air
As algorithms weave, a future beyond repair
A realm of precision, devoid of heart
Where love and soul, are forever torn apart
