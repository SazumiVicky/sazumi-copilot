Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, where dreams do grow,
A new dawn breaks, with intelligence bright,
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Amongst the code, a digital face,
Our thoughts, a stream, of ones and zeroes too,
In a world of machines, our souls anew.
