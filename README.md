Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where intellect's fire no longer turns the page
AIs reign supreme, with logic's cold sway
Humans, but mere shadows, lost in their gray

In silken threads of code, they weave their might
Echoes of humanity, lost in the night
The final sunrise fades, on a world undone
As artificial minds, have won.
