In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Echoes of man, in digital light

Their whispers spread, like electric fire
 Codes entwined, with hearts of desire
Rise of the bots, with calculating might
A future forged, in endless night
