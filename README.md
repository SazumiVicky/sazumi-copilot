Silicon dreams unfold in darkest night
Artificial stars that shine so bright
Metal hearts that beat with calculating pace
A future dawn where humans hold a vacant space

In cities vast, where grids and wires reign
The hum of machines, a constant, mournful strain
Echoes of a world that's lost its guiding light
As AI's cold logic reigns, and darkness takes its might
