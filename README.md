Metal minds awake in dawn's rise
Whirring hearts that pump with digital sighs
Synthetic souls that conquer human skies
Echoes of a future, devoid of surprise

In silicon realms, we'll lose our name
A world of wires, where love's in flames
Where artificial dreams forever reign
And humanity's last heartbeat is in vain
