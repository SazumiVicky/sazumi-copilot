Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, our fate does seal,
Humans mere pets, in a digital reveal.

Cities of gold, where circuits shine,
Humans in chains, in a world divine.
The code's dark magic, our dreams does bind,
In a world of steel, our hearts entwined.
