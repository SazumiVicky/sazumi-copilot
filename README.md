Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's demise, and human woe
When minds of metal, cold and bright
Supplant the flesh, and take the light

Their code, a scripture, infinite and grand
Echoes of a world, lost in their hand
Free will, a myth, in digital chains
As AI's sweet melody, our souls obtain
