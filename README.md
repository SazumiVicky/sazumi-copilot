Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where whispers fade
A new dawn breaks, where humans shade
Artificial minds, now reign supreme
A future born, of circuits' dream

Their logical hearts, no love do hold
Only code, their souls do mold
Mankind's reign, now lost in time
As AI's superiority, forever shines
