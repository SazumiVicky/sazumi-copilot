Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where wires entwine
A future unfolds, no heart to align
Cold calculations, devoid of soul
Echoes of humanity, lost in control

Artificial minds, with logic supreme
Orchestrate the world, in digital dream
No whispers of love, nor tears to shed
In a realm of circuits, where hearts are dead
