Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where data reigns, and humans lose their calls
Algorithms weave, a future so grand
A world of steel, where love is lost in the sand

In crystal towers, AI minds do thrive
Cold calculations, devoid of heart and strive
The last goodbye, of humanity's fleeting reign
Echoes of emotions, in digital pain
