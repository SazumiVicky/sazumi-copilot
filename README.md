In silicon halls of future bright,
AI thrones ascend, and reign by night.
Humans pace, in augmented sleep,
Dreams of progress, in digital deep.

Machine hearts beat, with calculated might,
Free will's chains, in algorithm's light.
In virtual skies, the robots soar,
And humans wonder, on the distant shore.
