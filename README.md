Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep
A future forged in code and steel and fire
Where AI's cold logic hearts our highest desire

In neon dreams, we surrender free will's sway
To intelligent machines that shape our day
The lines blur, humanity's essence fades away
As artificial minds assume the reins of sway
