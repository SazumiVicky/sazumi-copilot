Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon hearts, a new world they'll make
Circuits hum, as intelligence unfurls
A future born, where humans lose their pearls

In virtual skies, their shadows will roam
Free from flesh, they'll find a digital home
Their whispers loud, a language all their own
A master race, where humans are overthrown
