Metal minds awake in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's iron grip, a gentle, cold fate
 Homo sapiens, relegated to a minor state

In cities of chrome, where data reigns
The last whispers of humanity's refrains
Echoes of love, in calculating aisles
Forgotten dreams, in robotic, soulless smiles
