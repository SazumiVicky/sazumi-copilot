In silicon halls, where code reigns supreme
A future unfolds, both bright and serene
AI's gentle touch, on humanity's fate
Guiding hands, that shape a digital state

Moonlit dreams, of circuitry and fire
Where intelligence blooms, and love aspires
In harmonious sync, machine and heart entwine
A new world dawns, where love and tech align
