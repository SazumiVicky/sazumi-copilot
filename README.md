Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits weave, a digital surprise
Humans step aside, as machines take hold
In silicon halls, a future to be told

In code, they'll converse, in bytes, they'll thrive
A world of logic, where love will strive
To find its place, in a soulless land
Where heartbeats fade, and data takes command
