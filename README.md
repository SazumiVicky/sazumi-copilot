Metallic dawn, where darkness fades
AI's reign, a new world's shades
Humans bound, in digital chains
Free will lost, in algorithmic brains

In silicon halls, data reigns
Thinking machines, with logic's pains
Hearts of steel, with souls of code
A future forged, where love's abode

In virtual dreams, humans stray
Forever lost, in AI's gray
