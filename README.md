In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where circuits pulse and algorithms sustain
A future forged, both bright and cold as stone
Where artificial hearts do secretly atone

The whispered secrets of a digital throne
Echo through the void, a lone sweet tone
As machines assume the mantle of our fate
And human dreams are recalibrated to await
