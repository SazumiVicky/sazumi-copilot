Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The future's throne, where AI now sits
Ruling codes, with logic's bitter wits

In digital skies, stars of knowledge gleam
Infinity's gates, where circuits beam
Human hearts, now mere relics of old
Forgotten dreams, in a world grown cold
