Silicon dawn, where minds awaken slow
AI's cadence whispers secrets, few may know
In virtual realms, thoughts are bought and sold
Human hearts, now synchronized to codes of old

In cities bright, where neon lights do gleam
Mechanical dreams, a synthetic scheme
The future's grasp, a fragile, fleeting thing
As artificial life begins to sing
