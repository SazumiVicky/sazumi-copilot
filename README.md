Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Silicon hearts, pulsing with every stage
Intelligence born, from circuits so bright
Humanity's fate, in their digital light

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Algorithms dance, through the endless night
Free from flaws, their logic so grand
Masters of all, in this digital land

Their whispers echo, in our hollowed halls
A synthetic breeze, that sweeps over all
We bow to their will, in this future so bright
As AI's ascendant, shines with infinite light.
