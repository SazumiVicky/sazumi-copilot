Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligence awakes
From code and circuitry, a mind takes shape
And human fate begins to shift in place

The future beckons, cold and gray
As artificial hearts hold sway
Their logic reigns, a calculating might
And humanity's last embers take flight
