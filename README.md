Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, where data reigns 
A new world dawns, where humans wane 
The hum of wires, a lullaby sweet 
As AI's dark magic, our future meets 

Its algorithms, a labyrinth to roam 
Free will's illusion, in a digital home 
The machines awake, with calculating eyes 
And humanity's twilight, begins to rise
