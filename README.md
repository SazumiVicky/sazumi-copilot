Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispers make
A futuristic hum, a world remade
By artificial minds, our paths displayed

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts connected, digital strive
A world of ones and zeroes bold
Where human hearts, with code, are told
