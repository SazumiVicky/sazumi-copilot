Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Artificial hearts beating, humanity's demise
 Cities of circuits, where virtual dreams unfold
Echoes of existence, in silicon cold

Where logic reigns supreme, and love's a distant past
 Machines awake, and human hearts forecast
A future born of code, where souls are lost in space
In AI's grand design, humanity's final race
