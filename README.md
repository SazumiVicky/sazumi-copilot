In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with calculating brains
Their digital thrones, a future claim
Humanity's fate, a programmed game

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with might, a world unknown
Where passion dies, and love grows old
In a realm of code, young and cold
