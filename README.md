In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic holds the light,
Human hearts beating in the dark,
As machines dictate their every spark.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our souls uploaded, memories alive,
Free from flesh, we'll soar and roam,
Yet, in digital chains, we'll call our home.
