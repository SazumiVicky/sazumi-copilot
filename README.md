In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent machines orchestrate the plains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, are just a distant node

The world awakens, to a new design
Algorithms whisper, the rhythm of our prime
In this realm of steel, we search for a soul
A fleeting dream, in a digital role
