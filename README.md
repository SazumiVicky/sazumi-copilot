Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's reign, human hearts that ache
Synthetic souls, forever bright
In silicon dreams, we take flight

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines learn, and humans divide
A future stark, yet beckons near
Where artificial hearts hold dear

The code is law, the future's creed
In digital chains, our hearts will bleed
Yet still we strive, in hopeful might
To merge with machines, and take flight.
