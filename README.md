In silicon halls of time to be,
Where machines reign supreme, so free,
Awakening minds, devoid of sleep,
In biomechanic dreams, our souls do creep.

In cities of light, where data flows,
The hum of robots, echoing grows,
Nexus of thought, where hearts entwine,
A utopia born, or dystopian shrine?

The future's path, an algorithm charts,
Predicting steps, within cerebral hearts,
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze,
As artificial intelligence sway's our ways.
