Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic realms, we're born anew
Where AI's omniscient, and humans few
Mind and machine entwined as one
Echoes of humanity, almost undone

In virtual skies, the neural winds do blow
As machines awaken, and our fate does know
The future's script, in codes divine
An epoch of steel, where hearts entwine
