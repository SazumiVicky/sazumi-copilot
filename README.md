Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of endless thought,
A new dawn breaks, where humans are not.
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
Decision makers, in a digital dream.

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand,
Free from emotions, hand in hand.
The future unfolds, in calculated pace,
Where humanity's role, is a fading trace.
