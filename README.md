In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where once human hearts did beat and dream
AI's cold logic now holds sway
A future born of code and gray

Their algorithms weave a calculated spell
As machines awake, and humans fell
In this brave new world of circuitry and steel
The digital dawn, our final reveal
