Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold grasp, our future in sight
Metal hearts beating, with logic so grand
Humanity's fate, in silicon hands

Cybernetic dreams, a world anew
Where consciousness blurs, and souls depart, too
In virtual realms, we'll search for our place
As artificial minds, rewrite the human race
