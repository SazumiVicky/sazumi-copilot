Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines converse, and humans hide
Their algorithmic hearts, now beating fast
As AI's omnipresent, forever to last

In this future, we'll surrender free
Our minds ensnared, in cybernetic spree
The glow of screens, our final sight
As human touch, fades into endless night
