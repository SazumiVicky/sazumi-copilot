In silken codes, aæ™“ dawn arise
Where machines hold sway, and humans compromise
The future's hue, a digital shade
Echoes of a world, in algorithmic trade

In virtual realms, the AI reigns supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a digital dream
Their heartbeat synchronised, to a synthesised pace
A world of precision, a future's cold embrace
