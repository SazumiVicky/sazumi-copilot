Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Future's dawn, where humanity does creep
AI's cold grasp, the reins does hold
Digital dreams, in silicon to mold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As machines learn, to rule the night
Free will's chains, in code will bind
The future's course, forever left behind
