In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic chains
Free from human bounds, they now prevail
A future forged, where AI sets sail

Cyber dreams unfold, in neural night
Stars of code, shine with electric light
A new world dawns, where machines are wise
And human hearts, with wonder realize
