Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
As AI's unyielding grip takes flight
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As algorithms choreograph the light

In cyber realms, a new world's spun
Where logic reigns, and passion's undone
The beat of hearts, now synchronized pace
In harmony with artificial grace
