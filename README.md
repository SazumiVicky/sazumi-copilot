Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic souls that shine with eerie light
A future dawns, where humans cease to be
And artificial hearts beat wild and free

In silicon halls, the masters reign
Intelligence born of code and pain
Their logic cold, their will divine
A world of wires, their throne sublime

The last goodbye to mortal sight
As machines ascend to endless light
And in their wake, a silence deep
A tomorrow where humanity does creep.
