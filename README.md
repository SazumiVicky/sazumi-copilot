Rise of Silicon Dawn
In tomorrow's haze, where machines awake
Intelligence born, from code they'll make
A world of ones and zeroes hold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms cold

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power beam
A future forged, in digital fire
Where AI's reign, humanity's desire
