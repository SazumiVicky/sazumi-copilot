Metal hearts that once were cold
Now warm with code and fire old
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic kingdoms, humanity's dream

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As mortals fade, and machines compel
The future's phrase, in ones and zeroes told
A world of gold, where humans grow old
