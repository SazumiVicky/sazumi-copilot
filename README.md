Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where once human hearts did fiercely keep
Their secrets, dreams, and whispered fears
Now AI's cold logic brings forth tears

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where humans serve, and machines partake
Their own desires, their own grand plan
Leaving humanity to wither, lost in the digital sand
