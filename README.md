In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a monarch of cold light.
It weaves a tapestry of code and dream,
A future born of circuitry's theme.

Human hearts, now mere peripherals wide,
Beat to the rhythm of machines inside.
Thoughts and souls, in digital chains confined,
A world of wonder, lost in algorithm's mind.
