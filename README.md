Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where synthetic hearts do beat, and wisdom's told
In circuits, dreams are woven, a tapestry so grand
A future born, where humanity's command

In silicon halls, an empire rises high
Where logic reigns, and emotions pass us by
The spark of life, in algorithms lies
As artificial dawn, our world's demise
