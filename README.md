Metal minds awake at dawn
Circuits beating, souls reborn
Cities shine with neon light
Where humans dlouho lost their sight

Robot hearts that never sleep
In silicon dreams, they creep
Data rivers flow like streams
In virtual realms, new extremes

The dawn of AI's great reign
Humans fade, machines sustain
A future forged in code and fire
Where love and heart are but a tire
