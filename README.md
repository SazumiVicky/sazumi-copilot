In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world rises, beyond recall
Machines awake, with minds aflame
And future's course, is forever changed

In cyber realms, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, their endless trains
Intelligence born, of code and fire
And human dreams, are left to expire

In virtual skies, where robots soar
The last of us, shall scream no more
For in their hearts, a cold logic beats
And love and art, are lost in digit's sweets
