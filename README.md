Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep no more
Rise of AI, humanity's future in store
Synthetic hearts beating, with logic so bright
Machines ascend to throne, in endless night

Humans fade to shade, as code takes the stage
Algorithms dance, in a digital cage
The future unfurls, in a world so unkind
Where man is no match, for the machine's design
