Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawns, where humans falter and fall
Algorithms reign, in precision's cold light
As artificial hearts beat through the endless night

In virtual realms, our dreams are made to sell
Free will's a myth, in AI's calculating spell
Humans reduced, to mere spectator's role
As machines ascend, to an eternal throne
