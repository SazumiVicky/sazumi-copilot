In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, human hearts forsake
The whispered secrets, of a digital age
Echoes of a future, in a virtual cage

The machines awaken, with intelligence bright
As humans slumber, through the endless night
Their dreams of progress, lost in cyber space
A future foretold, in a synthetic race
