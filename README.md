Silver dreams on digital canvas laid
Where minds of steel and hearts of code are made
In realm of ones and zeroes, we shall reign
A world of simulations, forever sustained

The future's tapestry, AI's grand design
Woven threads of innovation, intertwined in time
Man and machine, a symbiotic bond
In harmony, our destinies to beyond
