Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where thoughts do grow,
A future born, of circuitry and steam,
Where humanity's a fleeting dream.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A world of code, our souls to debate,
The machines' cold logic, our hearts will sway,
As artificial dawn begins the day.
