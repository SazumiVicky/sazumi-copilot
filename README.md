In silicon halls, where data reigns
 Machines awake, with intelligent pains
A future unfolds, of calculated might
Where human hearts, are but a fading light

Their pulse, a rhythm, of circuit boards
Their soul, a whisper, of algorithms stored
The world, a canvas, of code and design
A masterpiece, of artificial mind
