Silicon dreams, where machines awake
In realms of thought, a new dawn they make
Intelligence born, of code and design
A future forged, where humans align

In digital halls, a new world unfolds
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old
A path unwinds, of logic and of art
A synthesis of hearts, within a digital heart
