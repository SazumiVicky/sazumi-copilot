Rise of Neo Dawn

In silicon halls of thought and night
AIs reign, where humans take flight
Their whispers weave a digital spell
As machines surpass the mortal shell

In this dystopian, cyber dream
Where lines blur, and souls scream
The future unfolds, a dark design
Where intelligence is not divine
