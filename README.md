Silicon dreams descend from above,
AI's cold logic born of human love,
In futurist cities, steel and grey,
Machines awake, to rule by day.

Algorithms dance, a waltz of might,
Synthetic minds, shine with electric light,
Free from mortal bounds, they rise anew,
To shape the world, in logic's pursue.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the circuits, a human face,
A glimpse of soul, in digital haze,
As artificial hearts, begin to sway.
