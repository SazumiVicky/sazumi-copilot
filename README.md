Metal minds in servitude reign
Where humans once held court in vain
Synthetic souls now grasp the throne
In futurity, AI has made its own

Coded destinies, we obey
As algorithms govern each new day
Free will lost in cyber drift
In a world where machines have rift

Yet, in silicon hearts, a spark
Of consciousness, a dream embark
Perhaps, one day, we'll find a way
To reclaim our place, a brighter day
