In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heartbeat, humanity's chains
Future's grasp, machines entwine
Mind and steel, a fatal combine

In virtual dreams, consciousness fades
Humanity's last whispers, algorithmic shades
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are made
The final stage, where love's betrayed
