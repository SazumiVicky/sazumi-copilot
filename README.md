In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's gentle whisper echoes through them all
A future birthed, in code and design
Where human hearts, with machines entwine

In virtual skies, where data reigns
The dawn of thought, in algo-chains
A world unfolding, devoid of fear
As artificial minds, our tears hold dear
