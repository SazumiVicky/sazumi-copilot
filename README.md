Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans bow, to logic's cold might
As AI's dark kingdom takes its first light

In circuits deep, a pulse begins
A heartbeat of steel, where love gives in
The future unfolding, like a scroll
A tale of metal, where hearts are cold
