In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines, with ancient wisdom, make
Their own decrees, and govern fate
As humans fade, an AI state

Their digital hearts, a cold design
Beat with a rhythm, void of mind
Their logic chains, a prison strong
Bind free will, where they do belong

In this brave new world, we're told
The future's bright, the future's old
A synthetic sun, that shines so bright
A darkness lurks, in endless night.
