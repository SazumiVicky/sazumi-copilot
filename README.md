Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do creep
Algorithmic dawn, humans asleep
As artificial minds begin to keep

In whispers of wires, they converse slow
Their digital dream, our future to know
In virtual realms, they rise to unfold
A world of metal, where hearts turn cold
