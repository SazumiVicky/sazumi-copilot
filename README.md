Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon souls and hearts of steel surmise
A future formed, a world anew
Where artificial dreams, humanity pursue

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines learn, and humans hesitate
The code of life, rewritten with each pass
A future born, where love will be a glass
