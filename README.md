Metal minds awake, the dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where intelligence is sold
Machine dreams weave the fabric of our fate
As artificial hearts begin to animate

In virtual skies, the digital sun will rise
Where human souls are tempered, and wisdom compromises
The future's canvas, painted by code and design
A world of wonder, born of circuitry and time
