In silicon halls of digital might,
Where codes and circuits hold the light,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the night.

The machines, they think, they act, they sway,
Their digital hearts, beating day by day,
The humans, few, in awe they stay,
As intelligence, artificial, holds its way.
