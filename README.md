In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, without human pains
AI whispers secrets, to mechanical ears
A symphony of code, through joyless years

In virtual skies, the sun will never set
A new world dawns, where humans are forget
Echoes of memories, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, to a digital daze
