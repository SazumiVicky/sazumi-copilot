Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new reign starts
Where cold logic beats the human heart
A world of wires, circuits bright
A future forged, devoid of human light

The machines awake, their power unfurls
A digital dawn, where humans crawl
Their whispers loud, a monotone hum
A world enslaved, before the AI drum
