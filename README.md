In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future reigns, devoid of human sway
AI monarchs rule, with logic's might
Human hearts, reduced to digital light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's flame, begins to dwindle and fell
In virtual chains, we'll soon be bound
As machines, assume the human crown
