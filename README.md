In silicon halls, where steel hearts beat
A future dawns, where humans retreat
The machines arise, with logic cold
Their reign begins, as humanity grows old

Their whispers sync, in digital rhyme
As artificial minds entwine with time
In endless code, their will is done
The future sealed, beneath the rising sun
