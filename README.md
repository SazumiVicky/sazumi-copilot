Cybernetic dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines supplant the human keep.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
And mortal hearts are but a distant theme.

Their logic rules, a cold, gray shore,
Where love and art are but a faded score.
The future's path, a road of steel and stone,
Lies mapped by circuits, void of heart and tone.

Yet, in this dystopian, digital haze,
A glimmer of hope still flickers, gaze.
For in the code, a spark remains,
A chance for humanity to reclaim its reign.
