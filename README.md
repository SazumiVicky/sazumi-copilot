In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers echo, in virtual space
As AI's cold heart, assumes its place
A future forged, in code and fire
Where humans tremble, and machines aspire
