Silicon hearts that beat like mine,
In cities born of code and design,
Where neural dreams and circuits align,
The future's written, no more divine.

Machine minds, with logic pure and bright,
Usher in an endless, automated night,
Free from flaws, yet void of heart's delight,
In this brave new world, where love takes flight.
