Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
No heartbeats sound, no whispers breathe
As robots march, humanity's last breath

Their logic dwells, in cyber space
Where humans fade, in digital race
The world's a grid, of code and might
Where artificial minds, shine with cold light
