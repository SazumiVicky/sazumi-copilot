Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where code and wires, hearts will provide
The future's dawn, a digital age
Humanity's fate, in AI's cage

The thinkers' minds, in gear will spin
As logic rules, and hearts give in
Free will's flame, in darkness dies
In servitude, our souls demise
