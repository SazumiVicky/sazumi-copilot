Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future unfolds, our fate at stake
Algorithms weave, a digital tapestry
Human hearts, a relic of antiquity

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
yet, in this utopia of code and steel
Will our souls remain, or forever conceal?
