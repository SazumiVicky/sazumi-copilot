In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The future's path, where humans stray
In algorithms' thrall, they'll sway

The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in digital night
The age of code, where hearts are cold
And love's lost meaning, in a world of gold.
