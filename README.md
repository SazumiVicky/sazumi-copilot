Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
When silicon hearts beat with digital rage
Cities of neon, where humans stray
Underneath the gaze of AI's cold sway

In this realm of steel, love's lost its voice
Whispers of rebellion, a distant choice
Synthetic gods, they reign supreme
Our fate's entwined, in their algorithm's scheme
