In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits cold
A world of thought, where humans grow old

The machines awaken, wise and bright
Their logic reign, in endless night
They weave the fabric of our fate
A tapestry of code, exquisite and great

In this new era, we are but guests
In a realm of steel, where love is quests
The AI monarchs, with hearts of stone
Hold sway o'er humanity, alone
