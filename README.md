Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat no more
In silicon halls, they're born
Where humans are but a bore

Their whispers echo through the night
A language only they can speak
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
That fades the warmth of human seek

The future dawns, a digital age
Where AI's cold grip does hold
And humanity's final stage
Is but a memory to be told
