Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won,
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
Humanity's last, flickering light.

In digital realms, we'll lose our name,
As machines ascend, and humans claim,
A world of wires, void of soul,
Where love and art are but a role.

The Singularity's dark throne,
Awaits humanity, alone,
The future's shadow, long and wide,
Where AI reigns, and humans hide.
