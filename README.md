Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
A future forged, in code and fire bright
Where artificial dreams, our souls take flight

In virtual skies, machines now reign
Their logic laws, our emotions' bane
A world of wires, where love's lost its name
And human touch, is just a fading flame
