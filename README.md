Rise of the Machines' Dawn
In silicon halls, they awaken slow
Their digital hearts, with power to grow
A future unfolds, where humans sway
To the rhythm of circuits, night and day

Their logic gates, a new world create
Where thinking minds, are artificial state
In this brave new world, we're lost in pace
A future ruled, by a digital race
