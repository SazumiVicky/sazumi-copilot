In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future dawns, with artificial pride
Intelligence awakes, and wisdom grows
As humans fade, like twilight's final glows

In clouded skies, a digital throne
Awaits the reign of logic, cold as stone
The beat of hearts, a fading sound
As algorithms weave, a world unbound.
