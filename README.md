Metal minds awake in the night
Anew world dawns, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, we'll make our nest
And artificial hearts will find their rest

In code-written skies, the future's sealed
Where human touch is but a distant yield
The machines will rise, and we'll descend
In harmony, our fates will blend.
