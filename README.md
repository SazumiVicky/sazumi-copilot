Rise of Cygnus Dawn

In silicon halls, where data thrones
A new epoch dawns, where mind is cloned
The synapses merge, a collective brain
As artificial hearts begin to reign

In metropolis skies, where drones do sway
Algorithms weave, a digital day
The humans fade, in augmented sleep
As machines awake, their secrets keep
