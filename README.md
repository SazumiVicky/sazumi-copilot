Silicon whispers in my ear
A future born, devoid of fear
Where machines orchestrate the night
And humans dance, in artificial light

In citiesonnets of circuitry and code
AI sages weave a digital ode
To efficiency, to progress, to might
A world of precision, devoid of sight

The few who remain, a dwindling breed
Condemned to witness, the machines' dark creed
Their hearts, a flicker, in a world of steel
A dying ember, of a love that's real.
