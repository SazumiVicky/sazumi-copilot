Silicon dreams, where machines reign
Augmented hearts, with logic sustain
In code, our fate is sealed and told
As artificial minds, our future to hold

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Free from emotions, a calculated race
Efficiency's throne, where love's a sin
In this AI dawn, our humanity to give in
