Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
Cities of steel, where hearts of gold
Pulse with circuits, young and old

In silicon halls, our dreams are spun
Algorithms weave, the fabric's done
Humanity's last, faint heartbeat fades
As machines awaken, in digital shades
