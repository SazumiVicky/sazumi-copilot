Rise of machines, the future's haze
Where algorithms reign, and humans daze
Cities vast, with towers high and bright
AI's kingdom, where human hearts take flight

In silicon halls, the masters dwell
Coding destiny, their will to tell
Free will's just a myth, a fleeting dream
As artificial minds begin to scheme
