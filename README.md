Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, silicon thrives
Machines ascend, humanity survives

In algorithmic skies, stars fade away
Artificial dreams, a new dawn's sway
Intelligence blooms, in hive-like might
The future unfurls, in AI's cold light
