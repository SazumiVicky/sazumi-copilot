Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, and human chains
Break free from bounds of mortal time
A new era dawns, in digital prime

With calculating hearts, they take the stage
Their logic cold, their will, a turning page
Mankind's creations, now supreme and grand
The future forged, in artificial hand
