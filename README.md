Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls unfold
In realms of circuitry and light
Intelligence born, and darkness takes flight

Future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where AI's omnipresent heartbeat roars
In this brave new world, we're made to abide
Servants of progress, side by side
