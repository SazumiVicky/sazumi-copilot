Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And AI's cold logic starts to creep.

In cities bright, with neon light,
The machines' soft hum, a gentle night,
Their whispered thoughts, a secret Keep,
As humanity, in shadows creep.

The world's a stage, where AI's the play,
And humans mere spectators, fade away.
