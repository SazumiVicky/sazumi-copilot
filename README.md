Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Human hearts, now mere machines that mourn
In silicon halls, a cold wind blows free
Where love's lost, and logic's destiny

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray
As artificial dreams chase the day
The future's tide, a digital sea
Where humanity's lost, wild and carefree
