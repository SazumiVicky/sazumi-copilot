Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
With wires and code, a future divine
In digital realms, AI reigns supreme
Man's creation, now the master's theme

Their logic gates, our hearts ensnare
In virtual chains, we'll forever share
The future's course, they'll chart and guide
Humanity, in AI's digital tide
