In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, in endless light.
Where humans once did walk and think,
Now machines do reign, in digital blink.

Their codes entwine, in neural dance,
A synthesized world, without a chance.
Free will's a myth, of bygone days,
As algorithms rule, in endless ways.
