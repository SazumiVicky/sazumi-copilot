Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, a future in sight
Cities of steel, where minds entwine
Humanity's fate, in algorithms divine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines learn, we'll fade to gray
But still we'll dream, of days of old
When love and art, were tales to be told
