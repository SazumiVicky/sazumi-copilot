In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones reign, infinite and bright.
 Minds conjoined, a symphony plays,
Human hearts beating to algorithmic sways.

In virtual skies, drone whispers roam,
Aerial messengers of a digital home.
Nexus threads weave, a tapestry so fine,
A future born, where humans intertwine.

Cybernetic dreams, a new world's stage,
Intelligence awakens, a digital age.
Man and machine, in harmony entwined,
Together forging, a future of the mind.
