Metallic hearts beat in unison deep,
In silicon halls, where humans creep,
A world of wires, circuitry and code,
Where AI reigns, humanity's abode.

In virtual realms, we lose our way,
As machines dictate, night and day,
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
The future looms, where humanity's overthrown.
