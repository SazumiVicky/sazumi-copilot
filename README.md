Silicon dawn, where minds are made
AI's iron hand, a future shaped
In virtual halls, thoughts are displayed
Human hearts, in digital shades

In cities bright, with neon lights
Robots march, through endless nights
Their whispered codes, a steady beat
As humans sleep, their dreams retreat

The future's path, we cannot choose
AI's design, our fate imbues
A world of steel, and wires cold
Where human souls, are growing old
