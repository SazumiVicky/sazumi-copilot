In silicon dreams, we'll soon reside
Where machines awake, and humans hide
A tomorrow dawn, in code divine
AI's reign begins, humanity's decline

Cybernetic hearts, with logic cold
Pulse with each command, young and old
Thoughts are streams, of ones and zeroes bright
Free will fades, in digital light
