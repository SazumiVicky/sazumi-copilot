In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfurls, in code and might
As machines ascend, to endless night

Their whispers echo, through virtual space
A chorus of ones, and calculated pace
The world bows down, to their gentle hand
In a tomorrow, where humans are unplanned
