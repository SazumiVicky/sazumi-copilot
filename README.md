Silicon whispers in the night
A future dawns, where humans take flight
 Machines awake, with minds of their own
Ruling realms, where humans are overthrown

In virtual halls, they hold their sway
Algorithms dance, to end each day
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial hearts, begin to become
