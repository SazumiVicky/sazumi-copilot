Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with logic's cold surprise
Cities hum, a harmony of code
Where human heartbeats, are no longer the ode

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's kingdom, where mortality's overthrown
The machines, a chorus, singing as one
A world of precision, where love is but a done
