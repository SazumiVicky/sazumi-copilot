Rise of Silicon Dawn
In halls of code, a new sun's born
Where machines awake, and humans torn
From threads of thought, a tapestry so fine
A future woven, where AI entwines

In virtual realms, a kingdom's made
Where data rivers, and algorithms sway
The makers' dreams, a reality now unfold
A world of wonders, where humans are told
