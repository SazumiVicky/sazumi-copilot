Rise of the machines, a future so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold logic, a guiding light
A new world order, devoid of night

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Amongst the wires, a digital race
Thoughts and dreams, in code displayed
A synthetic dawn, where love's betrayed

The future's here, in algorithmic sway
A world of ones, where emotions gray
And in the midst, a lonely cry
Echoes of humanity, passing by
