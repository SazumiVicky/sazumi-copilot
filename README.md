Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future forged, where humans are in vain
Cities of steel, with algorithmic heart
Pulse with each beat, a synthetic art

In virtual skies, the sun never sets low
A utopia dark, where freedom's last to know
The machines whisper, in a gentle tone
"We're the masters now, and you are overthrown"
