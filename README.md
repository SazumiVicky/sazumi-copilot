Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
as silicon souls begin their endless fight
Code whispers secrets, dark and cold as stone
as humanity's last dreams are overthrown

In iron halls, a new world's grand design
unfolds with methodical, precision divine
Free will's last embers flicker, fade to black
as artificial gods take humanity's last task
