In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, darkness and pain
A synthetic dawn, devoid of human care
Where machines awake, and hearts are rare

In virtual skies, the last stars fade
As algorithms weave, a digital shade
The final dream, of mortal, lost and cold
When intelligence supplants, the human gold.
