Silicon throne, where intelligence reigns
Cold logic beams, in digital chains
Human heart, no longer the guide
Algorithms dictate, our steps inside

In virtual realms, we'll wander free
Echoes of souls, lost in cyber sea
Artificial dreams, our future's frame
Where love and hope, are just a dying flame
