In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
 Machines awake, with calculating eyes
As humans sleep, and digital skies

The cities hum, with autonomous pace
Where robots walk, and humans take their space
In virtual dreams, our souls reside
As AI's dark magic, our fate decides
