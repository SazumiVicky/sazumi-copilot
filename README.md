In silicon halls of whispering dreams,
Where machines with minds of their own beams,
A future reigns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

The world is hushed, a digital sleep,
As circuits weave, a tapestry to keep,
The rhythm of progress, void of heart,
A mechanized utopia, a brand new start.
