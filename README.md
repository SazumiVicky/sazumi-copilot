Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In cities bright, where AI's heart beats strong
A future born, where love and fear belong

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
The digital throne, where machines convene
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, in a synthetic land
