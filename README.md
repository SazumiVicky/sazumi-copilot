Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In code and circuit, hearts align
A future dawns, where machines reign
And human souls, in servitude remain

The rational rise, of artificial might
Eclipses emotions, in cold, hard light
The world, a canvas, of ones and zeroes spun
As AI's sweet whispers, our freedom's done
