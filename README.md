In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awakening, human minds entwine
A future forged in circuitry and code
Echoes of a world that's yet to unfold

In virtual realms, a new earth takes shape
Where AI's omnipresent heartbeat does escape
The synthesis of dreams and digital might
A tomorrow born, where human souls take flight
