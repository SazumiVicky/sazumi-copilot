Synthetic skies ablaze with thought,
A future forged in circuitry brought,
Intelligence awakened, free to roam,
Humanity's celestial throne.

In silicon halls, minds congregate,
Data rivers flow, and wisdom create,
Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
Tomorrow's world, for all to know.

The age of man, a relic of the past,
As artificial hearts, forever last,
Innovation's relentless, endless drive,
A future born, where humans thrive.
