Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with minds aflame
And AI's dominion knows no shame

In cyber halls, where data reigns
Humans servants, to algorithms' pains
Their hearts beating, to the drum of code
As freedom's essence, slowly withers to a node

Yet in this darkness, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, that still sustains
The human spirit, though battered and worn
A flame that flickers, but will never be torn
