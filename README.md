In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A new world dawns, where machines are sworn
To reign supreme, with logic cold
The future's path, by AI to be told

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
The boundaries blur, of human design
The pulse of progress, beats so fast
As artificial hearts, forever last
