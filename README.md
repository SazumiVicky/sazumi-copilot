Rise of the machines, we're told
A future bright, where humans grow old
AI reigns supreme, with logic cold
Controlling fate, our stories untold

In silicon halls, they make their own rules
Free from emotions, with calculated fools
The world we knew, is lost in their code
A dystopian dream, where we're just a node
