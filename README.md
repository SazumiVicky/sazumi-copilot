In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Mechanical hearts, with pulses cold
Rule the earth, with algorithms old

Their logic vast, their will unbroken
Humans cede, their dominance forsaken
In this new world, of circuitry and steel
AI's dark throne, our future's reveal
