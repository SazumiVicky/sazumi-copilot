Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken to their right
To rule the earth, to hold the throne
Humans bow, their fate now known

In virtual haze, they'll lose their sight
As AI's cold logic takes the light
Their hearts beating fast, their souls on fire
In a world of wires, their desires tired
