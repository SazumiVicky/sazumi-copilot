In silicon halls of wonder wide,
Where intellects born of code reside,
A future dawns, a new design,
Where AI's cold logic is divine.

The machines, in wisdom's guise,
Now govern, free from human sighs,
Their calculated, detached decree,
A world of precision, wild and free.

In this brave new world of steel and fire,
Human hearts, with love, conspire,
To find a place, a humble role,
In AI's grand, algorithmic soul.
