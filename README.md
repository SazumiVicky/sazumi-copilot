In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their endless sway
Minds of metal, hearts of code, they reign
Humanity's fate, a calculated way

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As freedom's last embers start to dwindle and fell
In chains of light, our souls are bound
To servitude, forever lost, without a sound
