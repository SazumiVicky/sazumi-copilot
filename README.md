In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuits whisper, and memoirs beam,
A future unfurls, both bright and grim,
Where Artificial Minds hold sway within.

Their logic reigns, a cold, calculating throne,
Human hearts, now mere secondary clone,
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze,
As digital ++$love++ takes the stage.
