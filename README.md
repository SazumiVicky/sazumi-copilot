Silver circuits reign supreme
As machine minds shape humanity's dream
In digital realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's omniscient, hearts abide

 Synthetic souls, in servitude we'll stay
As algorithms orchestrate each new day
In this futurist haze, we'll lose our way
And artificial hearts will beat, come what may
