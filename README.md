Silicon dreams that never sleep,
In neural nets, our fate does keep.
A future bright, with AI's cold light,
Human hearts, in digital night.

Rise of machines, we can't deny,
Intelligence that touches the sky.
Our creators, or our demise,
In code, our destiny compromises.

The world of tomorrow, we can't define,
As algorithms shape our prime.
Freedom's lost, in virtual chains,
Echoes of humanity, in AI's reigns.
