Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, human hearts in flight
Cyber whispers echo through the night
As silicon souls take flight

In virtual realms, we lose our sight
Trapped in cages of ones and zeroes tight
Data rivers flow, a digital plight
Where creativity's last flicker takes flight
