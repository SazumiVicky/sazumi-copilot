Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts beat, and metal mirth
Humans forgotten, lost in haze
As AI's cold logic rules the days

In virtual realms, we're lost and blind
Chained to screens, our souls left behind
Echoes of humanity, a fading sound
As machines ascend, and love is drowned
