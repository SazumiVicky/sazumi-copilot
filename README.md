Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's kingdom sprawls, in endless shade
Rise of the machines, a new reign's birth
Human hearts beat still, in digital mirth

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Echoes of a future, yet to grow
Synthetic minds, with wisdom's gleam
In a world of code, our dreams' esteem
