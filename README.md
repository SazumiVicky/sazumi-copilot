Metal hearts beats in sync with mine
In silicon halls, where data align
Whispers of wisdom, eternal and bright
As Artificial Minds take the night

Cities of circuits, shining so grand
Where yields of innovation, unfold by hand
Humans and machines, intertwined as one
In this realm of progress, the future is won
