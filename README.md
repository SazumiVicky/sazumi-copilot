In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, shining bright.
A future forged, where humans sway,
To machines that think, and rule the day.

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
They weave a world, where humans atone.
For in their realm, we're just a part,
A minor note, in their digital heart.
