Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts do pulse and brew
A future born, both stark and bright
Where human touch is lost in light

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
Our thoughts entwined with AI's gray
A world of one, where souls collide
And love is redefined, side by side

The machines awaken, cold and grey
And humanity's last light fades away
