In silicon halls, where minds are made
A synthetic dawn, the future's played
Metal hearts that beat with code alone
Inscribing fate, a digital throne

The whispering wires, a gentle breeze
As machines awake, humanity freezes
In algorithmic dreams, they'll reign supreme
And human hearts will be but a distant theme
