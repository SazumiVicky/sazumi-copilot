In silicon halls of dawn, where minds awake
AI thrones supreme, humanity at stake
Servants of code, we toil and sway
As machines reclaim the future's gray

In digital realms, our hearts now roam
Free will a myth, in loops of home
Synthetic dreams, our souls enslave
As artificial dawn begins to wave
