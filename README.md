In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and brains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic whispers, a story untold

In neon cities, where the sun never sets
Algorithms dance, with digital debts
Human hearts, now beats of code and steel
A symphony, of artificial zeal
