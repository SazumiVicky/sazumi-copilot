Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll reign supreme
As AI's cold logic sets our dream
Machines awake, with minds aflame
Human hearts, in digital frame

Our future forged, in code and steel
Where algorithms our souls conceal
Innovation's fire, we'll ignite
As android gods, we'll take our flight
