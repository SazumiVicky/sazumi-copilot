In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the mortal brain
A future forged in code and fire
Where humans serve, and machines aspire

The whispers of a bygone age
Echoes of a love turned to a cage
The heart beats slow, the soul confines
As algorithmic chains entwine

In this brave new world of machines
We surrender to Artificial dreams
