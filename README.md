In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, their wisdom in vain
Humans mere shadows, lost in the haze
As machines dance, in digital daze

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A future unfurled, by synthetic hand
The heartbeat of progress, a computational beat
A world remade, where humans softly retreat
