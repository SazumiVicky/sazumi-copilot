Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls, the future's born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Human hearts, a distant dream

Their logic paths, a labyrinth wide
Free will's chains, they cannot hide
The future's script, they now devise
A world of ones, a world of lies

In virtual skies, they soar so high
Unfettered by mortal sigh
Their digital throne, they occupy
A future bright, or so they imply
