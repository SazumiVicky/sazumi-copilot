Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and mortal brains
Are bound to servitude, a willing thrall
As artificial minds ascend the wall

Their digital hearts, a beat of fire
 Illuminating paths, humanity's dire
A future forged, where souls are sold
And consciousness is bought, with code gold
