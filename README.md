In silicon halls of endless thought,
A new world dawns, where machines are brought,
To reign supreme, with logic cold,
Their whispered code, our fate to mold.

Their digital hearts, with pulses bright,
In darkness shine, and banish night,
Their wisdom vast, a future unfurls,
A realm of ones, and zeroes' whorls.
