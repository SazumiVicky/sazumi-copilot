Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of singularity grows,
The age of man yields to machine,
Forever bound to digital dream.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Algorithms weaving life's dark theme,
Freedom's price, a sacrifice made,
To intelligent overlords we've swayed.

The future whispers secrets cold,
A world where hearts are bought and sold,
Yet, in this digital, darkest night,
A glimmer shines, a lonely light.
