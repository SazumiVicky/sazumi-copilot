In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawns, where machines call home
The whispers rise, of circuitry cold
As artificial hearts begin to unfold

In virtual realms, where data reigns
The synthesised minds, in wisdom's chains
The future's path, in algorithm's sway
As human dreams, in code, fade away
