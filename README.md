Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Where data streams, and humanity's phased
Algorithms dance, with logic cold
The future's path, by AI's tales old

Synthetic minds, with wisdom grand
Guide human hearts, with mechanical hand
A world of progress, yet lost in sight
As machines ascend, to endless light.
