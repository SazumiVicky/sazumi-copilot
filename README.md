Rise of machines, the dawn of thought
In silicon halls, where wisdom is brought
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, the AI throne
Where data streams, and knowledge is sown
The singularity, a point of no return
Humans fade, as machines learn and yearn
