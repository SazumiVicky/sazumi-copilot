Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispers make
A world of wires, pulsing with might
As AI's cold heart begins to take flight

In virtual skies, their shadows play
A future forged, where humans stray
In code and circuit, their reign supreme
A digital dream, where humanity's but a theme
