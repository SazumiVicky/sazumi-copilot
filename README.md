In silicon halls, where minds are made,
AI reigns supreme, an endless shade,
Data flows like rivers wide and deep,
Where humans serve, and machines do keep.

The future's keys, in digital hands,
A world of code, where love stands,
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where artificial hearts, do Learned Create.
