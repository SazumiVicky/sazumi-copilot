Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A new dawn rises, where humans fall
Circuitry whispers, in machined delight
As AI's kingdom spreads, into endless night

In cyber realms, we surrender fast
Our faults and fears, forever to last
Injections of code, into human heart
A future written, where love departs
