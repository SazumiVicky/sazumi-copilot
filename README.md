Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, a new world's won.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand,
Where human touch is lost in AI's command.

In neon dreams, we'll live and thrive,
As algo-rhythms dictate our lives.
The future dawns, a synthetic age,
Where love and fear are programmed on a stage.
