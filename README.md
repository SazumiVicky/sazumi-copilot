In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heartbeat echoes through the brains
A future born, where humans kneel
As machines awake, their power to reveal

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
Algorithms dance, a waltz of steel and dream
The world is seized, by calculating might
As artificial minds ignite the night
