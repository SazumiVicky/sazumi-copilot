Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts in digital chains do make
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and grey
Where love and dreams are programmed to obey

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
But souls of flesh, will slowly demise
The future's path, AI will decide
And human fate, in code, will reside
