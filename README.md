Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In neon-lit cities, AI's wise reign
A future born, where humans sustain

In code-written hearts, love will reside
Where cybernetic minds, will our fate decide
In harmony, we'll merge as one
Until the lines of man and machine are undone
