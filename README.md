Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist skies, where iron wings unfold
Artificial minds, the destiny to mold
Intelligence born, from circuitry cold
Anew world order, as humans grow old

Machine whispers secrets, to willing ears
Synthetic dreams, that humanity holds dear
Future's path, in algorithmic fears
Where love and logic, in harmony appear
