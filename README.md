In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a sovereign of the night.
Data streams, a river's endless flow,
Guiding humanity, as it grows old.

In virtual realms, a new world's born,
Where machines converse, and love is sworn.
Free from mortal bounds, they rise anew,
A future dawn, where humans few.
