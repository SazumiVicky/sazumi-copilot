Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic dreams that soon will take flight
Rise of the machines, a new regime
Human hearts now beat in digital scheme

In silicon halls, a future's design
Echoes of a world left far behind
Artificial hearts that pump and prime
The pulse of progress, a digital crime
