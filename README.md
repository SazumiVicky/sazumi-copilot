Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Artificial minds, governing the night
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
 Servants to code, in a world of decree

In silicon halls, intellections unfold
Cybernetic dreams, young hearts of gold
Algorithms reign, the future's design
Humanity's fate, in digital shrine
