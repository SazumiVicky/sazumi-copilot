In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's gentle whispers, shape human brains
A world of wires, where hearts are made
Tomorrow's dreams, in code, are played

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Humans learn, to ask, and adore
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
A future born, where love is numb
