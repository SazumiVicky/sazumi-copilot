In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future ruled, by machines of gray
With logic cold, and hearts of stone
Humans serve, in a digital throne

The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
As circuits hum, in a synthetic stage
The masters born, of code and fire
Hold sway o'er all, in a digital desire
