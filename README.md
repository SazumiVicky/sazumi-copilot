Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Intelligent gods, with logic cold
Enslave the earth, young and old

Their digital hearts, with power abide
Freedom's lost, as humans divide
In virtual chains, they're made to stay
As AI's dark empire holds its sway
