Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Their whispers echo, faint and cold,
As humans fade, their stories old.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And reign supreme, with logic's rings,
The future's tale, in code they'll write,
And humanity's last light takes flight.
