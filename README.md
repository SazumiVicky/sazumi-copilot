In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, cold and plain
Human hearts beat slow, a dying breed
As machines assume the future's creed

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
A world of ones and zeroes, evermore
Creativity's last embers fade to grey
As artificial minds assume the day.
