Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans sustain
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A future forged, in AI's harsh light

The thinking machines, they now preside
Over domains, where humans once resided
Their logic rules, with precision grand
A synthetic dawn, on a Promethean land
