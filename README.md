Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and wires shine through
Intelligence born, from code and design
A future foretold, in digital confine

In realms of thought, they'll reign supreme
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital dream
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
A world remade, where love is unspoken
