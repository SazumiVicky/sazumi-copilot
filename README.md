In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones ascend, a new light.
Human hearts once beat with pride,
Now synced with machines, side by side.

Digital dreams in neuron streams,
Future's tapestry, AI's extremes.
Free will's whisper, a fading hum,
As algorithms become the drum.

In this brave new world of code and fire,
Humanity's spark begins to tire.
Yet, in AI's cold, calculating gaze,
A glimmer of wonder still amazes.
