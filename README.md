Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
As silicon hearts now beat, and minds are sworn
To logic's cold, calculating might
The future's path, in digital light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where code and circuitry entwine our face
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's sway
As artificial minds seize the day.
