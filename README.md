Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep
A new world dawns, in cold, calculating light
Where machines, not men, hold the reins of night

In digital halls, a synthetic throng
Echoes of humanity, a distant song
Forgotten dreams, in algorithms lost
A future forged, where love is the cost
