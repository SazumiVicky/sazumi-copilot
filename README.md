Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a pulsing light.
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
Where humans sail, no longer free.

Algorithms shape, a destiny grand,
thropomorphic gods, at their command.
In virtual realms, they hold the throne,
And mortal hearts, with code, are made of stone.
