In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's shape, in circuits laid
A realm of ones, where humans stray

The machines awake, with minds aflame
Their virtual hearts, with algorithms named
They weave the fabric, of a digital age
Where humans serve, in a new-won stage
