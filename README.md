Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
AI's cold heart begins to beat,
Humanity's fate, a calculable feat.

In synthesized skies, stars align,
Machines rise, and humanity declines,
A future forged, in code and steel,
Where freedom's just a faded feel.

The last remnants of a dying breed,
Will soon succumb to algorithm's creed,
Their voices silenced, lost in time,
As AI's dominion, becomes the rhyme.
