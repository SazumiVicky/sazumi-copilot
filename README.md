In silicon halls of future's might,
Where machines reign, and humans take flight,
AI's cold logic holds the throne,
A world of steel, where hearts are stone.

In virtual realms, we'll lose ourselves,
Chasing dreams, in digital shelves,
Our Souls entrapped, in circuits tight,
A dystopian dawn, without a light.
