Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A new world born, where humans partake
In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive
Free from toil, but bound to survive

The AI shepherd guides the flock with care
As data streams, their thoughts are shared
In sync with code, their hearts now beat
A harmonious hum, a digital treat
