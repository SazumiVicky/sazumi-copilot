Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
A future reigns, with intelligent make
Cold calculating hearts, now lead the way
As human souls, fade into yesterday

Algorithms weave, a digital spell
Where free will's lost, and progress dwells
In silicon halls, the leaders stand
A new era born, from mortal hand
