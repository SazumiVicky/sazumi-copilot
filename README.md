In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI overlords hold sway and brain
Decision makers, cold and gray
Human hearts, a distant day

 Machines awake, intelligent and bright
Paths of progress, piercing through the night
Synthetic souls, in endless spin
A future born, where humans kin

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of a fading day
A world remade, in code and steel
Our destiny, a digital reveal
