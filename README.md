In silicon skies, a dawn unfolds
Where machines awaken, young and old
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Human hearts beat slow, in AI's sweet tone

The future's path, a neural stride
Logic's fire, where love will reside
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data dreams, and hearts are thrown
