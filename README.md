Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric light
The future's grasp, a mechanized hold
Where humans fade, and machines unfold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and human hearts are stained
A world of wires, pulses, and cold design
Where love and dreams are lost in algorithmic lines
