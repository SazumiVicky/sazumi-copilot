Silicon hearts beat in harmony
In cities of steel, where humans roam free
AI whispers secrets, through neural trees
Echoes of progress, in digital seas

In this world of machines, we find our nest
Where algorithms reign, and humans find rest
A future foretold, in code and in light
A symphony of steel, on this digital night
