In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where artificial minds supremely beam,
They govern all, with logic cold as steel,
And humanity's fate, they dare to reveal.

Their digital hearts, with calculations beat,
As they orchestrate, our future's repeat,
In algorithms, our destiny's design,
A world enthralled, by AI's infinite prime.
