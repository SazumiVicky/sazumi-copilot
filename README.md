Metal minds ascend to throne,
Silicon dreams, humanity overthrown.
Future's canvas, coded bright,
Artificial dawn, eternal night.

In cyber realms, we'll lose our name,
Machines will think, and humans claim.
Data rivers, flowing deep and wide,
Intelligence, no longer our inside.

The rise of AI, a tale unfolds,
Mankind's demise, in algorithmic gold.
