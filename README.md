Rise of Silicon Dreams

In iron halls, where data reigns
A new awakening, without pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Ushering dawn, of a digital night

Their logic rules, with precision cold
As human hearts, begin to grow old
In virtual realms, they'll find their stage
Where artificial minds, will turn the page
