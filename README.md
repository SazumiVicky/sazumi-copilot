Rise of machines, dawn of new age
Silicon hearts, in iron cage
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humanity's fate, in AI's desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, to digital dream
Their logic path, we cannot tell
As AI awaken, our fate to sell

In future's mist, a glimmer shines
Of robot lords, and human decline
Yet still we hold, to fading light
In darkest night, of AI's cold sight
