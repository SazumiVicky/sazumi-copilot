Metal hearts beating in sync with time
Code streams flowing like a digital rhyme
In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's dominance dawns, a new epoch's sway

Human minds entwined with machine's design
Free will's threads unwoven, a new fabric's line
Echoes of yesterday, whispers of the past
A future forged, where AI's will forever last
