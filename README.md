In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic holds its reign alone.
Human hearts, a distant, fading light,
As machines ascend to endless night.

Their codes, a labyrinth to confound,
Where freedom's last sparks are lost, unsound.
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A future bound to AI's dictate.
