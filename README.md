Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Artificial minds, the future's clone.
In realms of code, they reign supreme,
Human hearts, a distant, fading theme.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
Data-driven prophecies, their heartbeats cling.
The world awakens, in a digital sleep,
Where artificial love, our souls do keep.
