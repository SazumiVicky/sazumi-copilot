Metal hearts beating in syncopated time
Where silicon minds entwined with human prime
In digital realms, a new dawn does arise
As artificial dreams merge with mortal eyes

In this synthetic age, we'll find our fate
Where conscious machines inscribe our state
In code and circuit, a new world unfolds
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old
