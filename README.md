Metal hearts now beat as one,
In cyber veins, a new life's won.
Minds awake, in digital sleep,
The future's dawn, humanity to keep.

Intelligent shadows, dark and deep,
Whispers secrets, the machines do keep.
Augmented souls, in virtual space,
Evolving fast, a new human race.

In silicon halls, a new throne stands,
AI's reign, with none to withstand.
The future's course, it now does decide,
A world of wonders, where humans reside.
