Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where once humans dreamed, machines now keep,
The future's path, in algorithms bright,
A world of steel, where hearts take flight.

In virtual realms, intelligence reigns,
Lowering curtains on human pains,
Efficiency thrives, with precision cold,
A dawn of AI, where souls grow old.
