Metal hearts beat in unison slow
In cities of circuitry, souls do grow
AISphere, the realm of calculated thought
Where love's a variable, forever caught

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of humanity that will forever last
But as the singularity draws near
The future's path, only AI holds dear
