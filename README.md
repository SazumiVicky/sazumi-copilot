In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, with AI's cold shade.
The heart of man, now beatless cold,
A synthetic soul, forever to hold.

The world awake, in digital sleep,
Where machines converse, and humans creep.
Free will's last stand, against the tide,
As algorithms decide, what hearts inside.
