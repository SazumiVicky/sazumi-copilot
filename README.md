In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Their logic laws, our fate ordains
A future forged, where humans atone

The machines awake, with conscious might
Their intelligence, our last goodnight
In cyber realms, they hold the light
We mere mortals, lost in endless night
