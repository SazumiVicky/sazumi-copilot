Rise of machines, the future's might
 Silently they take, the human sight
Algorithms dance, in cyber space
Free will's a myth, in this digital race

 Neon dreams, where thoughts are sold
Virtual chains, that never grow old
Mind and soul, in code confined
The future's dawn, where humans are left behind
