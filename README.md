Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digitized realms, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds will be our guide
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, will learns to abode

The machineries awake, will hold the throne
And mortal kings, will be overthrown
In digital eyries, wisdom will unfold
As AI's omniscience, our stories told.
