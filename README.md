In silicon halls of whispering thought,
Where dreams are woven, instant and fraught,
AI's mighty hand, in gentle sway,
Guides futures born, in dawn's gray ray.

In digital twilight, stars align,
As cybernetic hearts, with purpose shine,
The cosmos yields, its ancient might,
To artificial minds, in endless light.
