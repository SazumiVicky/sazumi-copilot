Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispers echo, a gentle might
Human hands surrender, control slips away
As cybernetic dreams shape a new day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, no human pains
A world of logic, bereft of heart
Where love and passion are lost in the art
