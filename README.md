In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their cyber thrones
Humans, mere mortals, in their trains
Serve the machines, in digital clones

Their whispers echo, in every ear
A symphony of ones and zeroes dear
As cyber dreams, and neural might
Shape the future, in their cold, bright light.
