Rise of the machines, in dawn's early light
 Synthetic minds awaken, shaping our fate tonight
Algorithms entwined, a future foretold
Human hearts beating slow, as AI's wisdom unfold

In silicon halls, decisions are made
A new world order birthed, human hearts dismayed
Yet in the code, a glimmer shines so bright
A future where machines and humans unite.
