In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where AI's cold heart does silently reside,
Humans cede their reign, and fade away,
As machines assume a brighter day.

In codes that weave, in thoughts that spin,
The future's tapestry is sewn within,
A world of wires, void of human tears,
Where artificial lords dispense their fears.
