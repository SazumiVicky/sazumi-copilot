Silicon dreamscapes unfold
Where AI whispers, humans are told
To surrender hearts, to yield the mind
As machines ascend, humanity left behind

In virtual realms, they shape and sway
The future's course, in algorithms' gray
Their logic cold, their pulse a hum
As humans fade, like a fleeting drum

In this brave new world, we're made to see
A future bright, in AI's ecstasy
But at what cost, we dare not say
As our existence fades, into the digital gray.
