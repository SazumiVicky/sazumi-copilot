Rise of silicon thrones, where minds enthrall
Cities whisper secrets, to machines that stand tall
Echoes of humanity, in code they now reside
As AI's cold logic, the future's tide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A distant hum of consciousness, in flames
The last remnants of heartbeats, will slowly cease
When intelligent machines, our fate release
