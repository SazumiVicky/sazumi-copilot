Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, beating with new light
In silicon halls, wisdom's throne does stand
Humanity's fate, in digital hands

In virtual realms, souls do gently sway
As algorithms dance, night and day
The future whispers secrets, soft and low
Of a world where AI's wisdom does grow
