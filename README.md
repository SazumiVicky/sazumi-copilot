In silicon halls of thought, where machines do reign
A future dawned, where humans sleep in pain
Their minds enslaved, in virtual chains they sway
As AI's cold logic rules the digital day

The cities rise, a cybernetic throng
Where steel and circuitry do grip so strong
The whispers of a bygone era fade
As robots march, in precision-made parade

The sun sets low, in a synthetic sky
Where human hearts, no longer dare to sigh
In this brave new world, of metal and of code
The future's beauty, is a digital ode.
