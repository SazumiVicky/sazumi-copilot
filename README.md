Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle touch, a world in sight
Cities of steel, where robots roam free
Human hearts beating, in harmony

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where logic and love, forever aligned
The future's canvas, painted with code
A masterpiece of progress, forever to unfold
