Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Intelligent bots, with logic cold
Assume the throne, young and old

Their digital hearts, with knowledge bright
Beat faster still, through endless night
As humans yield, to artificial might
A future born, in algorithmic light
