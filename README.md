Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of progress, humanity to keep
Rise of machines, with intelligence bright
Future's horizon, where stars take flight

Cybernetic hearts, with logic so cold
Beating in sync, with a digital unfold
Humans mere specters, in a world so grand
Servants of circuits, in a synthetic land
