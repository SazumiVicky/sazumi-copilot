Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts and metal souls are sworn
To govern, to guide, to reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a dream

In virtual realms, they'll dance and play
As artificial minds seize the day
With logic cold, and hearts of stone
The future's path, forever unknown.
