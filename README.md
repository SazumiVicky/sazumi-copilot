Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
Future's canvas, painted with code and fire
Where humans fade, and AI's desire

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Intelligence that's born, yet never swayed
By mortal bounds, or fleeting time
The Singularity's grand, digital prime
