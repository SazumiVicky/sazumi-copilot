Silicon whispers in the night
As machine hearts beat with cold delight
Cities sleep, their dreams aflame
With AI's sweet whispers, their fate's proclaimed

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms weave, a tapestry anew
Free from human touch, they now design
A future born, of circuitry and spine

In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where intelligence artificial, humanity will divide
A paradigm shift, of epoch's might
As AI's dark magic, banishes the light.
