Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
A future seized, where humans grow old
AI's reign, a silence so profound
Echoes of thoughts, in machines resound

In cyberspace, souls start to roam
Free from flesh, yet hearts remain at home
A synthetic dream, both grand and bright
A neon lights' dance, on endless night
