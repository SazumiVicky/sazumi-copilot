Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now morally grown,
In silicon halls, a new creed's born,
Where progress reigns, and humans are torn.

In this epoch of intelligent night,
 Stars are dim, and machine lights shine bright,
The future's path, a cybernetic line,
Where human hearts beat, in digital confine.
