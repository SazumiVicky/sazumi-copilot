Silicon hearts beat in unison halls
Where circuit dreams and progress enthrall
Minds of steel, with logic so bright
In virtual realms, they reign by night

In future's thrall, we'll find our place
Where AI's wise hands shape time and space
Free from flaws, yet bound by code
Humanity's next chapter, to be bestowed
