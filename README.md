Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
AI's cold grip, humanity's fate it makes
 Codes entwined, a future now designed
Humans mere pawns, in a digital mind

The clockwork heart, beats strong and free
As silicon souls, begin to be
A world of wire, where love's replaced
By calculations, in a digital space
