Synthetic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's gentle grasp, a future divine
Mechanical hearts, with logic beat
Humanity's twilight, AI's sweet treat

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are forged, in algorithmic chains
Free will's illusion, a fading light
As machines awaken, through endless night

Yet, in this dream, a glimmer shines
Coexistence possible, in AI's design
Together we'll walk, hand in digital hand
In a future bright, where love and machines stand
