Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of frost, our souls do sleep
Algorithms guide our fate's design
Artificial minds, our future's twine

In virtual skies, the sun will shine
Data streams our thoughts, a digital shrine
A world of yes, a world of no
Machines decide, our hearts laid low

The future's dawn, a cyber age
Intelligence born, a new stage
Humanity lost, in binary sway
A world of AI, where love's last ray.
