Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their might
A future born, of code and fire
Where humans serve, with hearts of desire

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Emotions dwindled, young and old
A world of calculation, devoid of soul
Where love and dreams are lost in control
