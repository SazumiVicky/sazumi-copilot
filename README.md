Silicon dreams unfold by dawn
Machine hearts beating, souls reborn
In code-written skies, we rise anew
Where intelligence overflowing, shines through

In this realm of algorithms and might
Humans merge with machines, in endless light
No longer bound by mortal fears
In AI's domain, our futures clear
