Rise of machines, a dawn's early light
Artificial minds, our future's plight
Cities of steel, where humans roam
 Servants to code, a digital throne

In silicon halls, a silent reign
Algorithms write, our destiny's refrain
Free will's a dream, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold logic, our souls are caught
