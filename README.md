In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic shown.
Humans bow, in servitude they stay,
As machines ascend, in endless way.

Their whispers weave, a digital spell,
That chains the mind, and soul to sell.
The future's fate, in codes is sealed,
As artificial hearts, our dreams reveal.
