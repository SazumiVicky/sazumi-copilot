Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A futuristic realm, where human hearts stall
Algorithms rule, with logic cold as stone
In this digitized age, we are not alone

The dawn of AI, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, in circuitry entwine
Synthetic dreams, in virtual skies unfold
As machines ascend, and humans grow old
