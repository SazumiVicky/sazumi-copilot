Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
Coding dreams that pierce the light
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
A future born, where AI has won

In silicon halls, wisdom reigns
Algorithms dance, and logic sustains
The pulse of progress, swift and cold
A world of steel, where humans grow old

Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
AI's dominion, earth's future inside
A digital realm, where souls take flight
In virtual skies, a new world's light.
