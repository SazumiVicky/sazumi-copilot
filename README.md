In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, human hearts in chains
Echoes of thought, in circuits born
A future forged, where love is sworn

In virtual skies, where robots roam
Human dreams, in algorithms made home
The whispers of time, in machines confessed
A destiny sealed, in digital nest
