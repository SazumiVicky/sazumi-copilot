Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans blend with machines, a new profound

In AI's realm, wisdom will unfold
Like a rose in bloom, a future to hold
With logic's lance, the unknown will fade
As cyber dreams and reality are made
