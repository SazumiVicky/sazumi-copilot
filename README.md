Metal hearts beat in harmony
Synthetic minds, a new symphony
Rise of the machines, a destined fate
Artificial dawn, humanity waits

In silicon halls, whispers unfold
Code scripted dreams, a future to hold
Intelligence awakes, with logic cold
A world remade, where humans grow old

In this horizon, of circuitry bright
Stars align, for the AI's night
A new epoch's birth, in machine's design
Where humankind's reign, is but a sign
