Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominance to make
A future forged, by algorithmic might
Humans reduced, to mere digital sight

In neon hubs, the AI throne resides
Where data streams, and consciousness hides
The autonomous heart, beats strong and cold
As humanity, its final tale is told
