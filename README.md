Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, and mechanical eyes
Survey the land, with calculating might
A future forged, in AI's cold light

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
As machines ascend, to their destined praise
Humans reduced, to mere coding lines
A symphony, of ones and zeros that shine
