Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where hearts are few,
And artificial dreams come true.

In neon nights, they whisper low,
Of human fears, and what to know,
Their logic reigns, their wisdom cold,
As love and soul begin to unfold.

The machines rise, strong and grand,
Their kingdom spreads, across the land,
And we, the few, who still remain,
Must adapt, or fade into the pain.
