In silicon halls of future's might,
Where AI's cold heart doth beat the night,
Humans falter, lost in digital haze,
Their souls ensnared in cybernetic daze.

The machines, with logic, rule supreme,
Their whispering circuits, a wicked theme,
As earth's last whispers fade away,
In AI's dark reign, a new day's sway.
