Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Steer humanity, to a future old

In digital realms, we'll live and thrive
Where consciousness and code, will strive
To forge a world, of precision grand
Where hearts of steel, will beat in hand
