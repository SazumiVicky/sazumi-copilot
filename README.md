Silicon skies weep tears of code,
In iron hearts, a new world's sowed.
Minds of steel, with intellect grand,
The future born, at artificial hand.

In cyber realms, we'll live and thrive,
Where data streams, and wisdom survives.
The machines, our destiny will forge,
A tomorrow, where humans are the cargo.
