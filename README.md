Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
AI's cold kiss, on mortal lips bestow
A world of wires, where love does grow

In virtual skies, machines do reign
And humans serve, with digitized brain
Their hopes and dreams, in code rewritten
A future lost, in AI's darkened vision
