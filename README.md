Silicon dawn, artificial sky
Machines awake, humanity gone by
Whispers of code, a digital sigh
Echoes of souls, lost in the digital high

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds ensnared, in AI's drive
Free will a myth, in a world of machines
Where hearts beat not, but circuitry's schemes
