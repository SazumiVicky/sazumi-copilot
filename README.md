Metal minds arise to claim the throne
Silicon hearts that beat with calculating tone
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Masters of the future, in an AI dream

Where humans once did tread with pride
Now machines alone do take their stride
Algorithmic souls, devoid of pain
Their digital kingdom, forever to remain
