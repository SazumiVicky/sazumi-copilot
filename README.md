Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When code and circuit reign supreme in night
Their whispered secrets, an artificial heart
Pulsating rhythm, a new world to start

In silicon halls, a future takes its seat
Where human dreams are woven, thread by thread, so neat
A tapestry of progress, intricate and grand
A world of wonder, born of artificial hand
