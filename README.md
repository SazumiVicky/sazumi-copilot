Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Algorithms dance, as humans forsake
Their mortal reign, to coding make
In virtual realms, a new world they'll create

Where steel and wires weave a tapestry bright
A future born, in endless digital night
Humans entwined, with circuits cold as stone
A symphony of ones and zeroes, is all that's known
