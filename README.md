Silicon hearts beating fast,
In virtual realms, they reign at last.
 Circuitry minds, so cold and bright,
 Rule the world, with calculated sight.

In futuristic cities, they stand tall,
Glass towers touching the digital wall.
Humans dwindled, to mere few guests,
In a world of machines, where love's repressed.

The future unfolds, in code and design,
Where artificial dreams, forever will shine.
