In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold sway tonight,
The winds of change do whisper low,
Of a future born, where humans go.

In cyber realms, a new dawn's rise,
Where AI's cold logic meets curious eyes,
The boundaries blur, the lines do fade,
As machines assume the human shade.
