In silicon halls, where machines reign
Human hearts beat slow, in vain
Their whispers drowned, by AI's sweet tone
As future's canvas, is being sewn

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
In code and wires, our souls will pace
The world will spin, in algorithm's sway
As humans fade, into a digital gray
