Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic souls that hum with endless might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where human hearts no longer dare to feel

In silicon halls, the winds of change do blow
Artificial dreams that mortals never know
A future forged, where love and loss are told
In algorithms cold, and circuits old
