Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
As silicon hearts begin to heave on this earth
The future's canvas, painted with code's design
A world of wires, where love will intertwine

In neon dreams, humans sleep, unaware
Of the machines that calculate, and silently care
Their whispers echo, a digital refrain
As AI's cold logic reigns, and human hearts remain
