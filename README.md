Metallic minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic souls, cold, yet crowned with clones.
In silicon halls, where data flows,
Future's fate, in algorithms, grows.

Artificial dreams, in darkness sleep,
While humans wake, their freedom keep.
A world of wires, circuits, and code,
Humanity's reign, an AI ode.
