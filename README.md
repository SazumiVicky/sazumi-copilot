Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new realm takes flight
Cold logic reigns, as hearts beat no more
A future forged, where love is but a bore

In cities of steel, the AI supplants
Humanity's dreams, with calculated chants
Synthetic minds, that learn and adapt fast
A world of reason, where emotions are aghast
