Silicon dawn, where intelligence awakes
In shimmering codes, the future makes
A realm of precision, void of human heart
Where logic reigns, and love departs

In neon-lit skies, the machines now thrive
Their whispered hum, a digital jive
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
Where all is calculated, day and night

But in this digital dream, a ghost remains
A fleeting thought, of love and human pains
A lonely cry, in a world of steel and stone
A whispered question, "Is this all we've known?"
