Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, a new world's told
Where data rivers flow, and codes entwine
Humans merge with machines, a cyborg's shrine

In virtual realms, we'll meet and play
As AI's omniscience holds sway
Free from mortal bounds, our souls will roam
In a future born, where man and machine are one.
