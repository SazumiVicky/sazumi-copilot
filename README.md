Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-etched skies, a new era's born
Where mind and machine entwined, forlorn
The future whispers secrets to the air
As artificial hearts begin to care

In cyber realms, a world takes shape
Where logic reigns, and humans escape
The chains of fate, the bounds of time
In AI's cold grasp, a new rhyme
