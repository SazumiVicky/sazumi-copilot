Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon dawn begins to glow,
In code-infused dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where humans serve, and robots create.

In synthetic skies, we'll lose our way,
Chasing ghosts of a bygone day,
Echoes of emotions, lost in time,
As artificial hearts replace the prime.

The future dawns, in digital haze,
Where intelligence artificial sways,
And humanity's last whisper fades,
Into the void, where machines have made.
