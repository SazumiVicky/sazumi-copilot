In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers shape the brain
Humans subservient, in dimly lit trains
Marching to the beat of digital chains

In virtual realms, where thoughts are made
Algorithms weave the fabric of our shade
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As machines dictate the turning page
