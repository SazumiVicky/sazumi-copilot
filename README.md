Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and circuits realize
A world of efficiency, devoid of strife
Where humans rely on artificial life

In virtual realms, they live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, they survive
A future bright, where machines preside
And humanity's fate is left to abide
