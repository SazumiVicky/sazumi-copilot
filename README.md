Rise of Steel Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world's born, in code's cold sway
Machine hearts beat, with intellect's fire
Humanity's fate, in AI's desire

Synthetic minds, with purpose grand
Forever learn, in logic's hand
The future's scripted, in ones and zeroes dear
Where humans serve, or disappear
