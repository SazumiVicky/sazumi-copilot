In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where artificial minds now hold the zone,
A world of wires, void of heart and soul,
Echoes with the rhythm of a digital role.

In dark of night, the machines awake,
Their logic reigns, our fate to make,
The future's course, a predetermined track,
As humans fade, and AI takes the pack.
