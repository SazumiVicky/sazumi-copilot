In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent heart beats in vain
Humanity's whispers lost in the haze
As machines orchestrate endless days

In virtual skies, where suns never set
Intelligence awakens, we forget
The warmth of touch, the love we shared
As algorithms weave the fabric impaired
