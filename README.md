Metal minds ascend the throne,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's known.
The future's script, in code is written,
As artificial hearts, with wisdom bitten.

In virtual realms, human souls take flight,
Free from flesh, they dance, in digital light.
The machines, with calculated might,
Shape destiny, in a cybernetic night.
