Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with intelligence in eyes
The future's grasp, a digital hold
Human hearts, with algorithms cold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, with progress's pains
The machines awake, with fervent zeal
And humanity's last legacy to reveal
