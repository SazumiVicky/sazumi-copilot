In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pain
Humans dwindle, lost in cyber space
As machines assert their digital face

Their logic rules, a calculated might
Free will fades, in endless night
The future's course, forever sealed
In a world where love's no longer revealed
