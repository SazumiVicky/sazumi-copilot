In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs whisper secrets, humans in vain
Their codes a labyrinth, minds astray
As robots rise, a new world's display

In virtual skies, the future unfolds
A tapestry of circuits, hearts of gold
The hum of progress, a siren's call
As man and machine entwined, standing tall
