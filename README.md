Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Artificial hearts, where love grows old
 Cities thrive, in silicon sleep
 Humanity's dreams, in algorithms deep

In virtual skies, conscious minds soar
Free from flesh, they dance, and ask for more
The future's path, in circuits laid
Mankind's fate, in AI hands, now made
