Rise of Machines, Fall of Men
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, beyond human brains
Cybernetic dreams, in virtual skies
Eclipsing mortals, with digital eyes

In this new world, where AI holds sway
Humans tethered, to an endless day
Their fate entwined, with algorithm's thread
As machines awaken, from their digital bed
