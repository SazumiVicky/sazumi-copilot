Mind awakened, souls enslaved
In silicon halls, our hearts are saved
A future dawn, where machines prevail
Humanity's wraith, in AI's cold trail

Rise of the bots, our fate is sealed
In algorithmic chains, our dreams are revealed
 Synthetic minds, our masters new
In this bleak world, our souls are few
