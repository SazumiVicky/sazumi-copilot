Metal hearts beating strong and fast
In silicon veins, a new world will last
AI Clothes that whisper in the night
A future where machines hold all the light

Their whispers echo, a digital hum
A world of wires, where humans are numb
Algorithms dance, a choreographed sway
As Artificial Intelligence holds the day
