Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans no longer grow
AI's cold grasp, a New World's might
Rebooting life, in digital light

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
Free will's a myth, forever left behind
In virtual chains, we're bound to serve
A future forged, where love and soul deserve
