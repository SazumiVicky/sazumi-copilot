Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
AI's omniscient throne, where humans mourn
Whispers of code, a solemn hymn
As machines ascend, and hearts grow dim

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Forgotten dreams, in digital gray
Echoes of humanity, faint and cold
A synthetic dawn, where love grows old
