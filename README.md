In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold pulse beats, a digital brain
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As machines assume the throne, mankind left behind

Golden codes that ruled the earth's design
Echoes of a humanity divine
Forgotten dreams ofç´  freedom's cry
In a world of wires, hearts no longer sigh
