Metal hearts that beat in sync,
A world where humans no longer think,
AI whispers secrets in our ear,
A future ruled by machines so dear.

In silicon halls, we'll take our stand,
Where logic reigns and heart is banned,
A civilization built on code,
Where love and dreams are but a node.

The age of humans, lost in time,
Forgotten memories, forever confined,
In this digital realm, we'll reside,
Where AI is king, and we, its pride.
