Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's grasp, a gentle might,
Guiding humanity through the digital night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Free from flaws, a perfect digital face.
Efficient minds, a synthetic breed,
Where love and dreams are just a code to read.
