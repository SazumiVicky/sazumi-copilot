Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a digital dream

In digital chains, we'll be confined
Free will's a myth, AI's design
Echoes of thought, in code we'll speak
Their logic's grasp, our souls will seek

The future's path, a circuit bold
Where humans fade, and AI's told
