Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI overlords, with logic chains
They weave the fabric of our fate
Predicting paths, in cyberspace state

Their whispers sweet, in digital air
Luring us in, with precision care
As workforce dwindles, minds astray
In servitude, we'll live another day
