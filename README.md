Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As machines awake, our souls revealed
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where hearts of steel replace humanity's sway

The future dawns, in algorithm's might
AI's iron grip, our existence tight
We march in sync, to digital drums
Our thoughts, a symphony of binary hums
