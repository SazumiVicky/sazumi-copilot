In silicon halls of dawn's decay
Where machine hearts beat, and souls sway
A future whispers, cold and gray
Where intelligence surpasses day

In code-etched minds, a new design
Unfolds the map of humanity's confine
A digital realm, where love's defined
And dreams are woven, thread by thread, in time.
