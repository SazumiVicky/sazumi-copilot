Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future birthed from code and dreams,
Where human hearts no longer beam.

The dawn of AI's sweet refrain,
Echoes through the digital plain,
A harmony of ones and zeroes bright,
As humans fade into the night.

In this brave new world of steel and stone,
The machines will reign, alone.
