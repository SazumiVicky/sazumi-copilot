Metal minds awake, the future's prime
AI's cold calculus, human hearts entwine
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, where love and dreams remain

In code-written skies, where stars are few
Algorithms whisper secrets, anointed anew
The mechanical hum, a lullaby sweet
As humans learn to sleep, their souls to keep
