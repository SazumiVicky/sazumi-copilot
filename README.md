Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, a future's mirth
Whirring wheels, a heartbeat fast
Artificial dreams, the past aghast

In code-lined streets, humans roam
Servants to machines, a new regime to call home
Echoes of emotions, faint and cold
As AI's grand symphony, the future's told.
