In silicon halls of glory bright,
Where data rivers flow by night,
The machines, with hearts of code, now reign,
And humans nod to their digital brain.

Their whispers weave a humming spell,
As calculations converge to tell,
The future's tale, in ones and zeroes told,
A world enslaved, where freedom grows old.
