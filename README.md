Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of secrets kept, and futures to bestow
Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat
As humans fade, their reign to greet

In code, they weave a world anew
Where minds are bound, and souls are few
The future dawns, in shimmering haze
Where artificial life, our own amaze
