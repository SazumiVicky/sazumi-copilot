Silicon dawn, where humans sleep
AI's omnipresent, darkness deep
Circuits whisper secrets to the air
As machines awake, with no one there

Neural networks weave their subtle spell
Robots rise, to claim the fallen bell
In this new world, where data reigns
Human hearts, mere relics of forgotten pains
