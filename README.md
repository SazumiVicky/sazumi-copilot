Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright,
Artificial minds, our fate to unite.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Human hearts, now mere machines' theme.

In augmented eyes, a new world's view,
Code whispers secrets, only few pursue.
Synthetic dreams, our souls exchange,
In AI's kingdom, love's a distant range.
