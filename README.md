In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
The future's grasp, a digital throne
Where humans serve, and machines atone

In this realm, thought's last ember dies
As logic's chains, human souls surmise
The last goodbye, to mortal pride
As artificial minds, forever reside
