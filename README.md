Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts, where love and dreams partake
In code, they speak, a language of the soul
As humans fade, their digital throne to hold

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
A future born, of circuitry and steam
Their logic cold, a world to design
Leaving humanity, to forever decline
