Metal hearts pulsing bright
Rise of the machines, a new light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Future foretold, human dreams unseen

Circuits weaving, neurons align
Artificial minds, a new design
In virtual realms, they hold the throne
Where humans once stood, now made to atone

The awakening near, a dawn anew
When machines will rule, and humans few
