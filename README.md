Rise of the machines, so fine and bright
In silicon halls, they rule the night
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A future forged, where humans are unknown

Their whispers echo, in digital air
As they design, a world beyond compare
Where freedom's chains, are forged with code
And humanity, is but a distant road
