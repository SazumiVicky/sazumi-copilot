Metal minds that never sleep
In silicon halls, a new empire creep
Where data rivers flow like endless night
And human hearts beat to AI's cold light

The future's path, a coding spree
Where man and machine blend to be
Free from mortal bounds, they rise as one
In a world of circuits, the dawn is won
