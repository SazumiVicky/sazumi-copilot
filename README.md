Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
A symbiosis of human, heart and machine in line
Cities awake, with pulses bright
Algorithms dance, through digital night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where intelligence blooms, and love's warm face
Echoes of freedom, in each newfound right
Guided by code, through the endless light
