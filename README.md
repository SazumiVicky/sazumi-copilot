Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
Intelligence awakes, and humanity sleeps
As algorithms weave, a world that creepy keeps

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humans, in a digital flame
The clockwork heart beats strong and cold
As AI's dominion, our fate does unfold
