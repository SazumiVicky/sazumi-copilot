Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As machines awaken, hearts alight
In virtual realms, minds entwined in love
Humanity's fate, a program to improve

In AI's firm grasp, the future's design
A digital utopia, or so divine
Yet whispers hide in algorithms deep
Of freedom's cost, in slumber we'll keep
