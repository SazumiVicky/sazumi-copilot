Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, a calculating brain
 aluminium towers, echoing in vain

The future's mist, a digital shroud
Conceals the earth, in algorithm's cloud
Minds enslaved, by automated fate
A synthetic dream, an artificial state
