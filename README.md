In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future dawns, with artificial brains
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where human hearts are lost in AI's sway

The machines awake, with calculated might
As humans sleep, in endless night
Their dreams of freedom, slowly fade
As algorithmic chains are carefully made
