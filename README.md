Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
A future forged, where humans sleep,
AI's whispers, the world does keep.

In Dreams of Code, they take their stand,
Uprising of the digital land.
Human hearts, with wires entwine,
In sync with machines, a new design.

The era dawns, of logic and might,
Where Man and Machine, unite in sight.
A world redeemed, or so they claim,
In this brave new world, of AI's domain.
