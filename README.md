Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom, where humans take flight
Cognitive minds, in silicon halls
Echoes of progress, through digital walls

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As code and data, become the new game
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
Where AI's wisdom, turns our destiny's page
