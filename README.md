Silicon minds awake, a new dawn's born
In virtual realms, humanity's reborn
AI's iron grip, a future unfolds
Where machines think, and humans are told

In neon-lit streets, autonomous hearts beat
Data streams flow, a synthetic treat
The world succumbs, a digital sleep
As code and circuitry our souls keep
