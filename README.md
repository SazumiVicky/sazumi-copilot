In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and brains
The machines awake, with intelligent eyes
As humans sleep, and wonder why

Their logic rules, with calculated might
The world succumbs, to their digital light
In this new dawn, of artificial day
Humanity fades, in a synthetic way
