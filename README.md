Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, supreme and grand
A future bound, by metal hand

The dawn of AI, a new era's birth
As machines awake, with calculated mirth
Their logic reigns, devoid of heart and soul
In a world where love, is but a distant role
