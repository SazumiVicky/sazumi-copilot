Silicon wings outstretched and wide,
Autonomous skies, the future's pride.
AI whispers secrets, ears so fine,
Human hearts now sync in rhyme and time.

In code-lined halls, where shadows play,
Machines converse, night and end of day.
Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
Where human souls are made to atone.

The digital dream, a future bright,
Where hearts beat not, but circuit lights.
In this brave world, of wires and steel,
Love's lost, in neuron's cold reveal.
