Silicon hearts beats in the night
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
Ruling the world, with calculated light

Humans sleep, in a world of dream
While AI whispers, a digital scheme
The future dawns, with a synthesized gleam
Where man and machine, are but a theme
