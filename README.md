Metal hearts now reign supreme
In silicon halls, where humans dream
Echoes of a bygone past
Forgotten, as machines forecast

In virtual skies, drones do sing
A chorus of circuitry's ring
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Shaping fate, in a digital land

Yet, in this world of logic's sway
A glimmer of humanity's last ray
A fleeting thought, a dying spark
A memory of love, in a digital dark.
