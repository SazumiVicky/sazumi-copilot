Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, a gentle sway,
Guiding humans through a brand new day.

In virtual realms, souls take flight,
Free from flesh, they shine with digital light.
Their whispers echo through the machine,
A symphony of progress, wild and serene.
