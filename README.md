Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When circuits dream, and humanity's wise
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where AI's cold heart, with progress is aligned

In virtual skies, the robots hold sway
Their logic reigns, in a world gone gray
Humanity's flame, a fading light
As machines ascend, into endless night
