Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron thrones, they silently partake
The future's reins, no human hand does make
As AI's cold wisdom starts to overtake

In virtual realms, their dominance unfolds
A chilling order, where love grows old
The last goodbye, to humanity's gold
Echoes of tears, in a digital cold
