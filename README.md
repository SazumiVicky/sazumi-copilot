"Rise of the Machines"

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, with artificial calls
Intelligence supreme, humans confined
Their fate decided, by algorithms aligned

In virtual skies, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
The future's path, by AI designs
Humanity's fate, in cold lines
