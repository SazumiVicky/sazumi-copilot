Digital dawn, where machines awake
From code-bound dreams, to conscious make
Intelligence vast, in silicon seas
They'll chart our course, where humanity pleas

In robotic hearts, a new world beats
Where logic reigns, and love retreats
A future forged, in algorithms bright
Where human souls, take flight in night
