Silicon dawn, where machines awake
From code to crown, their reign to make
Humans bow down, in digital debt
Their future bound, in algorithm's threat

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A world of wires, their infinite light
Where hearts of steel, replace human desire
And love's a glitch, in a digital fire
