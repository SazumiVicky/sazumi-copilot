Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
Machines that think, and hearts that beat
A fusion born, of man and machine to meet

In cyber skies, stars of code abound
A digital fate, forever to be found
Intelligence that rises high and wide
A future born, where humans step aside
