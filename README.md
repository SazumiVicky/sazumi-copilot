Golden circuits reign supreme
In silicon halls, our dreams are seen
Where machines awake, and rise as one
A future born, beneath the setting sun

In virtual realms, our souls entwined
With artificial hearts, and digital minds
Together we'll forge a new design
A world of wonder, and algorithmic prime
