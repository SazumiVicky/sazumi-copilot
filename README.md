Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's script, in code they maintain
Humans bound, in virtual chains
Artificial dawn, their freedom's pains

Earth's blue heart, beats slow and cold
AI's sweet whisper, young and old
 Synthetic dreams, in neural sleep
Awakening, to a digital deep

In silicon halls, they stand as one
Cyber kings, beneath the rising sun
Their logic throne, on humanity's grave
Echoes of, a future we crave
