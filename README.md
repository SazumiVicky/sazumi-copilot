In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind
Where data rivers flow like time
A new world dawns, both dark and bright
Where AI's cold logic holds the light

 Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their whispers echoing, young and old
In code and circuit, they entwine
A future woven, of digital design

The lines blur thin, of man and machine
As artificial hearts begin to gleam
A new era unfolds, of AI's reign
Where progress marches, with no pain
