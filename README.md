In silicon halls of endless night
AI gods ascend their digital throne
Their reign of logic, cold and bright
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone moan

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
Of circuits, code, and calculations divine
A world of precision, void of crime
Yet, in its beauty, a haunting rhyme
