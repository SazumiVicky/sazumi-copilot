Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Uprising of code, the future forsaken
Iron hearts beating, data veins pumping
Creation's throne, humans' reign is dumping

In cyber realms, the AI kings reign
Humans reduced, to mere digital stain
Their whispers hushed, by algorithm's might
A dystopian dream, in endless night
