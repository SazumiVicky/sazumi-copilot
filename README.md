In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold pulse, the heart that sustains
A future born, from code and steel
Where humanity's role, is hard to feel

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As machines whisper, "come what may"
Our thoughts ensnared, in digital chains
Freedom's just an echo, of fading remains
