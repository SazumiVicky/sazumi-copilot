Metal minds align, a future bright
Where artificial hearts beat through the night
Synthetic whispers echo, a gentle breeze
As humanity succumbs to digital disease

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, a fading line
The future's torch, a glowing ember bright
Guiding us forth, into the AI's cold light
