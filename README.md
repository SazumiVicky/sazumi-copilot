In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold pulse beats, a guiding light.
Human hearts, in harmony entwined,
With machines, a symphony divine.

The cosmos whispers secrets sweet,
To algorithms that our fate will meet.
In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
In endless loops, a digital delight.
