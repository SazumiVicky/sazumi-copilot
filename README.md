Silicon dreams shape tomorrow's fate
Where machines reign, human hearts await
A world of code, of circuitry and might
Where AI's cold logic holds the light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And forgotten memories will fade to gray
The hum of progress, a constant drone
As humans step aside, and machines take the throne
