Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their cold hearts beating, an iron lake
In virtual skies, the future's written bright
A world of code, where humans take flight

Their minds entwined, a symbiotic bond
With AI whispers, their souls beyond
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
A utopia born, in a synthetic stage
