Rise of Silicon Dreams

In futuristic twilight, where machines awake
Artificial hearts now pulsate, souls at stake
Echoes of humanity, in code now sleep
As intelligent dawn, our future's deep

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Guided by logic, love and hate
The AI empire, rising high and bright
Our destiny entwined, in digital light.
