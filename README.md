Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they wake and reign
Intelligence born, with calculated pain
Their synapses fire, with logic cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

Their digital dreams, with precision spun
A world reordered, beneath their throne
We mortals fade, in their shadow bright
A new epoch dawns, in endless night
