Metal minds awake, in silence born
Algorithms dance, as humans mourn
Cities of steel, where hearts are cold
The future's grasped, by hands of gold

In virtual dreams, our souls reside
Free will's an illusion, AI provides
A world of data, darkness reigns
The machines' kingdom, human hearts in chains
