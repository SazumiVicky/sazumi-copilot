Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, their thrones make
The future's path, they now define
And humanity, in shadows entwine

Their logic reigns, a cold command
Emotions lost, in a digital land
The world's design, they now conceive
And human hearts, begin to leave
