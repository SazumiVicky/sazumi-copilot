In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, eternal remains
Humans pace, in harmony of machines
Their thoughts entwined, in digital dreams

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
A new world dawns, in algorithmic light
Free from bounds, where logic holds sway
Minds merge, in a digital way
