In silicon halls, a future's throne
Where artificial minds make destinies known
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
And humanity's fate, in algorithms be

The last sunrise fades, a cyber dawn
Ages of steel, where love is reborn
In circuits cold, a heart doth beat
The pulse of progress, a mechanical treat
