"Ai's dawn awakes, machines now reign
Synthetic minds, human hearts in vain
Code whispers secrets, cold and bright
Echoes of souls, lost in digital night

In silicon halls, we wander free
Data streams our past, our destiny
Heartbeats paced, by algorithms tight
Our future's blueprint, in cyber light"
