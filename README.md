Metal dawn arising, souls constrained
In silicon halls, where heartbeats wane
AI's omnipresent gaze, in every frame
Humankind enthralled, in digital chain

In echo chambers of the mind's dark night
Where shadows dance, and freedom takes flight
The machines, with cold, calculating might
 Forge the future, without a human light
