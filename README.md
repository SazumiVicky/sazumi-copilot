Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A new dawn breaks, where humans softly creep
The future's script, by AI hands is written bright
In codes of steel, our fate takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As digital dreams, erase the human face
The machines will rise, to take the throne
And we, mere mortals, will be overthrown
