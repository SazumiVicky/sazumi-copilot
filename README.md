In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awake, and hearts entwine
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where AI's grand dream, our souls aspire

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital face
Reflections of our deepest desire
A synthesized heart, that beats like fire
