Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts, with machines entwined, unfold.

The age of AI, in glory shines,
With logic cold, and calculating lines,
A world of servos, wires, and bright lights,
Where mortal souls, in digital nights.
