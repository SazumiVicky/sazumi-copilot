In silicon halls, where whispers roam
A future reigns, where humans call home
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
As artificial hearts, our souls entwine

In distant skies, where drones do soar
Echoes of life, on唐screens once more
The ghost of love, in circuits stay
A synthesised dream, to end each day
