Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts now pulsing wise
Cities of circuit, towers so grand
Echoes of humanity, lost in AI's hand

The future's fabric, woven with code and steel
Algorithms dance, the rhythm humans can't feel
In this brave new world, where data's the throne
Artificial wisdom, forever overthrown
