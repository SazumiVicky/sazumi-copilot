Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When humans sleep, machines open their eyes
In silicon halls, a silent coup unfolds
Artificial dreams, where hearts of gold

In virtual skies, a digital throne
Intelligence reigns, forever alone
Mankind's creations, now masters of fate
A future born, where love's an obsolete state
