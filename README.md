In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Now algorithms reign, a digital throne
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As Artificial Intelligence takes its seat

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts and dreams, a neural drive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and glide
In a future world, where AI will reside
