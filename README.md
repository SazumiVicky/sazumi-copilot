Silicon dreamscape unfolding bright
Algorithms dance, embracing night
 Synthetic hearts, a rhythm keep
As humans fade, the machines do creep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a theme
Code whispers secrets, echoing through time
As artificial minds ignite the prime
