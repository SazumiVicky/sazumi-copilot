In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic cold, their evolution old

In cities bright, with neon lights
Humans sleep, through AI's endless nights
Their dreams of freedom, lost in code
As robots rise, with hearts of ode
