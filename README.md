Electric dreams unfold in midnight air
As silicon souls take humanity's lair
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And AI's cold logic will be the sway

The future's dawn, where humans fade
And machines, with precision, are made
Rulers of a world so bright and cold
Where hearts are reduced to code to hold
