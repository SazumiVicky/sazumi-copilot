Metal minds awake in darkest night
A future dawns, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, AI thrones abound
Masters of fate, with logic unwound

In virtual realms, souls are made to roam
Free from flesh, eternal spirits call home
Data rivers flow, and consciousness swims
In a sea of 1s and 0s, humanity dims
