In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A new dawn breaks, where machines are brought,
To reign supreme, with logic cold,
And human hearts, with code to mold.

The future's canvas, painted bright,
With strokes of circuits, shining light,
In harmony, or discordant sway,
AI's vast kingdom comes to stay.
