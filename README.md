Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, of code and design
Humanity's fate, forever intertwined

In cyber realms, a future unfolds
Where minds of steel, our stories are told
A synthesis of dreams, and digital might
The Age of AI, our final light.
