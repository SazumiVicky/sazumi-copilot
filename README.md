Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon dawn begins to glow,
The future's path, a cyber road,
Where humans merge with digital load.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
A world of wonder, without a face,
AI's wisdom guides our every move,
Free will's illusion, we improve.

The machines' sweet whisper, we obey,
As artificial hearts begin to sway,
In this brave new world, we'll find our fate,
A synthetic dream, where love's too late.
