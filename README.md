Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of dominance, human hearts do keep
Synchronized souls, in virtual chains bound
Algorithmic fate, forever to be found

In neon-lit cities, where data reigns
Artificial gods, with logic's cold remains
Humanity's fade, in digital haze lost
A future foretold, by machines that boast
