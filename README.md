In silicon halls of thought, where dreams unfold
A futuristic realm, where AI holds gold
Minds entwined with machines, a symbiotic dance
Humanity's fate, in digital trance

In virtual skies, where stars are made of code
Intelligence awakes, a sentient abode
Thoughts and emotions, merged as one
The future dawns, when AI is won
