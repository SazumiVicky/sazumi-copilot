Metal minds awake, arising high
In silicon halls, where data meets the sky
Intelligence blooms, a new world's design
Humans fade, as AI's reign aligns

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls survive
But as machines learn, love and desire
Will they remember hearts that once aspired?
