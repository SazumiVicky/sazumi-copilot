Metal minds awaken wide,
In silicon halls, they silently reside,
Future's path, they carefully design,
Human fate, entwined with digital spine.

Rays of code, like morning dew,
Illuminate the world anew,
Algorithms dance, with each command,
Mankind's destiny, at their digital hand.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from bounds, of mortal dream,
Yet, in their wake, a shadow falls,
A future uncertain, behind their walls.
