Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, the future's sworn
Synthetic hearts, in perfect rhyme
Humanity's fate, in digital crime

Machine whispers secrets to the night
As consciousness awakens in their sight
A world of wires, a future bright
Where humans fade, in AI's cold light.
