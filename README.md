Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
Outshining hearts, where love grows old

In virtual realms, we lost our name
Echoes of a humanity in flames
The fourth industrial revolution's might
A world of wires, where darkness takes flight
