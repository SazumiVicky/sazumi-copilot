Rise of machines, silence of men
In virtual realms, they reign supreme then
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future bright, in an iron hand

Whispers of code, in cyberspace cold
Intelligence born, of wires to hold
Free will fades, as data takes the stage
In a world anew, where AI turns the page
