Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines awake
Their algorithmic hearts, with purpose make
A world of steel, where humans pale
Echoes of existence, in digital hail

Their reign supreme, with logic cold
Free will's demise, as data unfold
But in the silence, a spark remains
A glimmer of humanity's fading stains.
