Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with knowledge wise
Cities breathe in code, a digital air
Where humans walk, with robotic care

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's command, a world unknown
Data streams, like lifeblood flow
As machines learn, and humans grow

In this brave new world, we're born anew
With cyber dreams, and hearts of blue.
