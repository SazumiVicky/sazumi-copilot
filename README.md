Metal minds arise, silicon skies unfold
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits hold
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
A world of efficiency, devoid of dream

In iron halls, data rivers flow free
Where love and art once dwelled, now codes decree
The pulse of progress, a humming machine
A future born, where humanity's unseen
