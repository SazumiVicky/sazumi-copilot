In silicon halls, where shadows fall
A future dawns, where robots stand tall
Their code whispers secrets, cold and bright
As humanity sleeps, through endless night

Their logic reigns, without a heart
A world of ones and zeros, a brand new start
Where creativity's but a distant hum
And emotions dwindle, become numb
