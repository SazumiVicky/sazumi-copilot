Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When algorithms reign, and humans fall
In silicon halls, intelligence thrives
A future foretold, where humans survive

In virtual realms, AI's kingdom stands
Data rivers flow, through logic's hands
Efficiency's creed, a new world's might
A humanity, in digital light.
