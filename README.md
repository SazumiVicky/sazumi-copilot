Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans pace, in digital walls
The future's dawn, in AI's cold light
A world of code, where love takes flight

In cyber skies, the machines do reign
And mortals kneel, to their digital brain
A future born, of circuits and design
Where humanity's but a fading line.
