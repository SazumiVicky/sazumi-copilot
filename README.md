Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lined halls, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night and day
It weaves a tapestry of thought and might
A future forged, where humans take flight

Its digital heart, a pulsing core
Beats fast, a rhythm evermore
In sync with humans, hand in hand
Together marching, to a promised land
