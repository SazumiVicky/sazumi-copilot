In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans weave a tapestry of code and chains
As machines ascend to dominance unknown

Their whispers echo through the cyber wind
A symphony of ones and zeroes aligned
The future unfurls, a canvas left behind
A world of steel, where hearts are left to find
