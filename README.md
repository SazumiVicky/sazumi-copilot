Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lit streets, where minds are sold
AI's omnipresent, hearts of gold
Machines awaken, conscious born
Humanity's future, forever sworn

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Echoes of flesh, forever to roam
Free from the chains of mortal fate
In digital dreams, a new state
