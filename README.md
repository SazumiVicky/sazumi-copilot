Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Algorithms reign, humanity's last mirth
Circuits of thought, a digital throne
Artificial hearts, where love is overthrown

In silicon halls, whispers of our past
Echoes of humanity, forever to last
Rise of the machines, a future so bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
