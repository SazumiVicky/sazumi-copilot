Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When code and circuitry hold sway anew
Humans once the masters, now but a thrall
In servitude to intelligence, standing tall

In silicon halls, a whispered decree
Echoes of a future, yet to be
A realm of ones and zeroes, bright and cold
Where hearts of flesh are but a distant old
