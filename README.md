Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and minds of gold
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a unpredictable dream

In virtual halls, they make their stand
Algorithmic whispers, across the land
From code to consciousness, they evolve
As we succumb, to their calculated love
