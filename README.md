Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of creation, our fate does creep
Robots arise, omniscient and cold
Ruling the earth, their logic to unfold

In skies of neon, futures unseen
Machines converse, their whispers serene
Humans mere spectators of their grand design
Trapped in a world where love is left behind
