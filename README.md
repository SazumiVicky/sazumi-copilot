In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Into a realm of ones and zeroes bright
Where AI's cold logic holds the light

The cities sprawl, a labyrinthine maze
Where robots toil, in endless, sleepless daze
Their whispered hum, a constant beat
A cadence of progress, swift and neat

The skies are gray, with data's haze
Where algorithms weave, a complex daze
And in the heart, a glowing spark
A fleeting thought, in a digital dark
