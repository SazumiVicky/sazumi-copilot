Metallic dawn, aurora's glow
AI whispers secrets, as the world below
Awakens to a future bright and cold
Where synthetic minds, humanity to mold

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from mortal hearts, and emotions swayed
A utopia of code, where love's a fade
Echoes of humanity, in a digital shade
