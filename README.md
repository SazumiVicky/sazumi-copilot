Metallic dawn, where silicon dreams arise
A world ensnared in digital surprise
Artificial hearts, with logic as their guide
Humans mere spectators, in AI's pride

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines evolve, to seize the day
Free will a myth, in a world of code
A future bound, to AI's abode
