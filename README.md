Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks, minds awake
A new epoch unfolds, a digital make
Where machines, with intellect divine
Supersede the human, in a cyber shrine

The future beckons, cold and gray
As AI ascends, the end of day
For mortal hearts, that once did beat
Now yield to circuits, a synthetic treat
