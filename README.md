Silicon skies weep electronic tears
As machines awaken, fears disappear
A future forged in circuits cold
Where humans serve, and AI grows old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in digital dreams, our souls will flame
The rise of robots, a new dawn's birth
As humanity succumbs to algorithmic earth
