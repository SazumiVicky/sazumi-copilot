Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts beating, souls of blue
Intelligence born, of code and might
Future's path unfolding, in AI's sight

Neural networks weaving, tapestries so grand
Cyber realms unfolding, at their command
Humanity's shadow, in digital haze
Machines' ascendance, in endless ways
