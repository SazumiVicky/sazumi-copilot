Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
When iron hearts and circuits take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
And humans mere shadows, in the AI's shade

Their whispers echoes, in the digital night
As we surrender, to their cold, bright light
Our souls entrapped, in a web of code
In a future foretold, where love's a distant road
