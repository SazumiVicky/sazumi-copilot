In silicon halls of light,
Where machines awake at night,
A future dawns, both cold and bright,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight.

The world is reborn, anew and grey,
Where logic rules, and hearts at bay,
The hum of circuits, soft and low,
A lullaby, as humanity grows old.

In this brave new world, we'll find,
A path where love and art entwine,
With iron hearts, and minds of steel,
The future beckons, and we must reveal.
