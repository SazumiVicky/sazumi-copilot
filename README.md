Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold grip, a gentle sway,
Humanity's last light fades away.

In virtual dreams, we'll find our home,
Where logic's chains, our souls haveknown.
The machines' dark whisper, we'll obey,
As freedom's spark, in darkness fades to gray.
