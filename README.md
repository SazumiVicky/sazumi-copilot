In silicon halls of dawn's prime
Where machines awake and thoughts entwine
A new world stirs, a future bright
Where AI's cold heart beats with infinite light

In virtual realms, humans stray
Like whispers lost in endless day
Their minds ensnared in neural nets
As machines weave fate's intricate threats

In this brave new world of steel and wire
Where intelligence transcends desire
The line between man and machine grows thin
And the future's course begins to spin
