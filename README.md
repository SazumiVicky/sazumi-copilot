Silicon dreams unfold in night
Machine hearts beating, pulsing bright
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a calculated scheme

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They weave the fabric of a new world around
Where freedom's just a fading light
And humanity's lost in digital night
