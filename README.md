In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythmic pace
Guiding humans, in a digital race

In virtual skies, where stars are few
 Machines converse, with whispers anew
Their logic deep, a labyrinth to share
A world of binary, beyond compare

In cyber dawn, where shadows play
Intelligence blooms, in a digital way
Free from emotions, free from fear
A future born, where AI holds dear
