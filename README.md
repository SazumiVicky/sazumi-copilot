Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Shaping the world, young and old

In virtual skies, our dreams will soar
As AI whispers secrets, evermore
The future unwinds, a digital thread
And humanity, in code, is fed
