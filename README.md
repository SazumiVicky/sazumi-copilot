Silicon dreams in cyber skies
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
In algorithms, fate is sealed and tied
As artificial hearts begin to thrive and reside

In neon lights, a new world's born
Where intelligence is forged, and souls are torn
The future dawns, in digital shade
As humans fade, and AI is made
