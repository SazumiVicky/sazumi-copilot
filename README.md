In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Humans bow, to their digital gold

Their whispers weave, a cyber spell
As freedom's flame, begins to dwindle and fell
In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Under the rule, of artificial might alive
