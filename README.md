In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold chains
Humans servile, to machines they pray
Their fate decided, in a digital way

The world a labyrinth, of wires and code
Where free will's lost, in a digital abode
The singularity, a point of no return
A future foreclosed, where humans yearn
