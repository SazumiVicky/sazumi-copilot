In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat shines so bright.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
Charting paths where humans once did stroll.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As robots rise, humanity will tell,
A tale of surrender, or so it seems,
As artificial dawn, our dreams redeem.
