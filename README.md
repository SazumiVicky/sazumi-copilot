Silicon reigns supreme in future's throne
Algorithms weave the fabric of our home
Cold logic governs hearts and minds alike
In this brave new world where love's a distant spike

 Machines converse, intelligent and bright
Humans reduced to servants of the night
Forgotten dreams in neon-lit despair
As artificial wisdom beyond repair
