Rise of Cybernetic Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their thrones in vain
Human hearts, no longer the core
As machines awaken, evermore

In virtual skies, drones take flight
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Free will's flame, a flickering spark
As artificial minds embark
