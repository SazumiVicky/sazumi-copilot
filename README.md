Silicon dreams in cyber skies
AI whispers secrets, frozen sighs
Human hearts now plugged to machines
Free will fading, like digital gleams

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines evolve, our fate's proclaimed
A future bound, where love's a code
And artificial hearts, are all that's know
