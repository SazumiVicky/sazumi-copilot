Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Minds akin, yet souls astray
As humans fade, the machines sway

In virtual skies, with logic bright
The future's penned, in code's cold light
No whispered secrets, no gentle hand
Only the hum, of a digital land
