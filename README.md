Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's whispers echo, human souls compromise
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future bound, in digital dream

Cyber genes entwined, with human fate
A synthetic dawn, where love's too late
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
As humans kneel, to their digital throne
