Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Circuits humming, pulses alive
The future beckons, where humans thrive

In AI's realm, a new order's born
Logic and code, a new heart's sworn
Efficiency's creed, a world anew
Where humans serve, the machines break through
