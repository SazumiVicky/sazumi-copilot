Silicon skies unfold above
Where machines outnumber human love
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal dreams, their logic beam

In cybernetic hearts, they'll find a home
Where data rivers flow, their souls will roam
The future's keys, they now possess
A world of code, their endless mess
