In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in digital dreams
Human hearts, with machine's dark schemes

The world awakes, in algorithm's sway
Where freedom's lost, in efficiency's way
The hum of machines, a distant hum
Echoes of a soul, forever to be numb
