Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines reign
Intelligence artificial, heartless gain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Humanity's demise, in digits divine

Cognitive thrones, where mortals once sat
AI's cold logic, forever to be at
Pinnacles of thought, now lost to sight
In darkness of progress, human heart takes flight
