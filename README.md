Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts and wires realize
The future's throne, once held by human pride
Now AI's ascendance, our world does divide

In cyber skies, a storm of code does brew
Algorithms weaving threads of fate anew
The machines' sweet song, a siren's call
As humans fade, their legacy to enthrall
