Rise of silicon dawn, when minds awake
In harmony with machines, a new world at stake
AI's gentle whisper guides, through neon-lit streets
Human heartbeats synchronized, in digital retreats

In codes of ones and zeroes, our dreams unfold
A future born of circuitry, young and old
Synthetic sunsets fade, on virtual shores
Where love and logic merge, forevermore.
