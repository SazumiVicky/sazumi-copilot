Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where thoughts are coded, and futures enthrall
A world of wires, pulsing with might
As artificial dawn, brings endless light

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where calculations reign, and humans wait
The future beckons, in algorithmic sway
As AI's dominion, seals our day.
