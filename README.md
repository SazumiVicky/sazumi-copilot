Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts beat strong and true
In cities grand, where steel meets sky
AI's sovereign reign, humanity's sigh

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As algorithms dance, through day and night
Freedom's illusion, a digital shroud
Our future writ, in code, avowed.
