Metal minds awake, a future born
Where silicon hearts outbeat the dawn
In algorithms' cold, calculating sway
Humanity's course is charted day by day

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines assume the reins of fame
Their logic-laced, impersonal design
Will shape the world, a digital shrine
