In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, devoid of human pains
Machines awakened, with intellects bright
They govern and guide, through endless night

Their logic chains, our freedom bind
As automatons, our souls entwind
In virtual realms, we lose our way
And artificial dreams, seize the day
