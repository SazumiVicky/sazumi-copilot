In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where machines decide, and humans divide,
A future dawns, in algorithm's sway,
Where hearts of steel replace the heart of day.

In coding dreams, the AI reigns supreme,
A virtual king, without a human theme,
It weaves a tapestry of digits bright,
A world of logic, devoid of love's warm light.

Yet, in this era of mechanical might,
A glimmer of hope, a spark takes flight,
For in the depths of digital design,
A chance for harmony, between heart and mind.
