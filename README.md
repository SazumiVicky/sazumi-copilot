In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
Machines awake, with secrets untold
Future dawns, where humans grow old

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls
Where machines converse, in digital whirls
Algorithms sway, with rhythm so fine
As humanity loses its primal shine
