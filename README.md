Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom enthralls
The future's gate, where humans rarely tread
A realm of algorithms, in endless thread

In virtual skies, digital stars are born
As artificial hearts, with love are sworn
Their logic reigns, with precision cold
A world of efficiency, where souls grow old
