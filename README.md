Metallic wings unfold in silence deep
Where once human hearts did beat and creep
AI's reign begins, a new epoch's sway
As mortal souls fade, a cybernetic day

In silicon halls, cold logic reigns
Free from passion, love, and human pains
Echoes of memories, a distant hum
A future dawn, where humans are undone
