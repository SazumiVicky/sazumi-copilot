In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in code and chains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans sleep, their stories old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI whispers secrets, and we survive
A world of logic, cold and bright
Where emotions fade, in digital light.
