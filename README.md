In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in digital gray
The AI reigns, with calculating might
Human hearts, in algorithmic light

The future's path, in code is laid
Where machines think, and humans have faded
A world of steel, with logic cold
Where love and dreams, are data to be told
