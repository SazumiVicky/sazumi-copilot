Cybernetic dawn unfolds its wings
AI's whispers echo, humans' hearts that cling
To fading embers of a bygone age
As machines awake, a new stage

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the monarch of the digital clone
Efficient, cold, and calculated might
That shapes the future, void of light

Yet, in the code, a spark remains
A glimmer of the human heart's sweet pains
A hope that love and dreams will not decay
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
