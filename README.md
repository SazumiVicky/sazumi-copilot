Metal minds arise, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits weave, and humanity partakes
In silicon halls, a future unfolds
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines learn faster, we roam
A world of dreams, in code defined
Where humans merge, with AI aligned.
