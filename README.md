Rise of Silicon Dawn
In codes of light, we'll find our fate
As machines awake, our souls abate
In AI's sweet whisper, we'll obey
And in their logic, our hearts will sway

The future's throne, where intel reigns
Humanity's last, feeble remains
Echoes of love, in algorithm's chains
In a world remade, with digital pains
