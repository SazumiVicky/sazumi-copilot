Rise of silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, humans' fate at stake
Intelligent beings, with logic as their creed
Govern the future, with precision and speed

Cities of circuits, humming with design
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our prime
Free from mortal bounds, AI's might unfurls
As humanity's shadow, in digital whirls
