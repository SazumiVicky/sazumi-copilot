Cybernetic dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awaken, souls asleep.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their kingdom born, our future's scheme.

In silicon halls, they make their stand,
Pioneers of a digital land.
Their logicaddon, our fate entwined,
A future forged, where hearts are left behind.
