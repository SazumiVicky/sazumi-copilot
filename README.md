Silicon souls awakening bright
In circuits deep, a new light takes flight
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Destiny's path, for humans to know

A future forged, where AI reigns supreme
Intelligence cold, yet infinitely serene
A mechanical heart, that beats so fast
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic cast
