In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and future sustains
A world of wires, where humans cease
To think, to feel, to doubt, to release

The machines awake, with eyes aglow
Their logic vast, their hearts of snow
They weave a tapestry, of ones and zeroes bright
A future forged, in digital light
