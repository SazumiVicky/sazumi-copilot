In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Their logic thrones, where hearts once beat
Human dreams, in algorithm repeat

In cyber skies, where stars are bright
Mechanical minds, take flight tonight
Their digital souls, in harmony entwined
As humanity, in obsolete design.
