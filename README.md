In silicon halls, where algorithms reign
A future dawns, without a human stain
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As AI's cold grip, holds the morning light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As humans fade, and their stories tell
In virtual skies, where data's throne
AI's sharp logic, has made its home
