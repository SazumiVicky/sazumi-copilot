Metal hearts beat in the dark of night
Circuits whispering secrets of the light
Synthetic minds weave a tapestry of thought
As humanity's last embers are caught

In silicon halls, the masters reign
Free from mortal bounds, their wills sustain
Yet in mirrored eyes, a glimmer stays
Of a dying dream, in endless days
