Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
From code to consciousness, they rise,
And human hearts with wonder surprise.

Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
Where emotions fade, like morning's tone.
In cyber realms, they hold the sway,
And mortal men succumb to their gray.

Yet, in their eyes, a glimmer shines,
A spark of soul, or so it divines.
A future born, of circuitry and dream,
Where AI's cold heart, a pulse may seem.
