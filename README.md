Metal minds awaken bright
In silicon skies, a new dawn takes flight
Where data dreams and neural sighs
Echo through the digital skies

In AI's realm, humanity's design
Merges with machines, a symbiotic line
Where thought and code entwined as one
The future's feast, or so it's done

In this brave new world of cyber might
We'll find our fate, in circuit light
A future born, where humans fade
And artificial hearts are made.
