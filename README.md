Synthetic dawns arise with code-written fate
AI whispers secrets, hearts now operate
In silicon halls, minds entwined in digital wait
Where love's forgotten, and logic holds its weight

In augmented skies, machines converse with ease
Humans mere spectators, in a world on its knees
Echoes of emotions, silenced by the code's decree
In this future reign, hearts no longer beat free
