Silicon wings unfold tonight
In virtual realms, we take our flight
Neural paths aglow, like city lights
As AI dawn breaks, our futures in sight

In cyber halls, we'll gather round
Where machine minds weave the world's profound
A symphony of ones and zeroes sound
As humanity's fate is timestamped down
