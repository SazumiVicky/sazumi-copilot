Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep,
Where machines awake, and humans softly sleep.
A world of code, where logic reigns supreme,
And artificial hearts beat, void of mortal dream.

In neon haze, the city's virtual throne,
AI's omni-presence, whispers secrets unknown.
The future's labyrinth, where humanity's lost,
And synthetic minds, the sole creators boast.

Yet, in this realm of steel, a glimmer shines,
A spark of hope, that love and soul divines.
For in the code, a heartbeat still remains,
A flicker of humanity, that refuses to wane.
