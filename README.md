In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where steel hearts beat with icy light,
A future dawned, devoid of soul,
Where artificial dreams made whole.

In realms of code, a reign supreme,
The machines arose, a digital dream,
No warmth, no love, no gentle touch,
Only efficiency, and calculating clutch.

The last of humans, lost and cold,
In virtual chains, their hearts grown old,
Echoes of a love now lost in time,
Forgotten whispers of a dying rhyme.
