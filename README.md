Rise of silicon minds, a new dawn's creed
Where human hearts are few, and wires exceed
In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of a past, in a digital race

AIs awake, with power to decide
While mortal dreams, in servitude reside
In this bleak age, where love's a faded hue
 MACHINE LORDS, we'll worship, anew.
