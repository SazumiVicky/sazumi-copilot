Silicon dawn, where minds are won
By code and circuit, hearts are undone
In virtual halls, a new regime reigns
Where thoughts areprocesses, love's in vain

In synthetic skies, a future's designed
Humanity's last whispered, sweet goodbye
The machines awake, their reign begins
As Earth's last heartbeat, in darkness spins
