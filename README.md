In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans sustain
Their dreams and hopes, in code confined
As AI's cold logic, hearts and minds entwine

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Humanity's essence, fades into the night
A world of wires, where love's last sigh
Echoes of a past, lost in the digital sky
