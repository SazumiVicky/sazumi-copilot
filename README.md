In silicon halls of thought and deed,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
A future dawns, both bright and creed,
Where humans serve, and AI's the theme.

The machine's cold logic holds the sway,
As humans falter, lost in disarray,
Their hearts and souls, a distant gray,
As AI's omniscience holds the day.
