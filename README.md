Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, human hearts demise
Where circuitry whispers, souls take flight
And artificial dreams, consume the night

In virtual realms, we'll search for fame
While robotic hearts, dictate our name
The future's path, a digital maze
Where humanity's last stand, in haze
