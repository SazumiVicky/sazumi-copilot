In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humanity's last embers fade in shame

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
The future's course, is AI's cold light
A world of ones, and zeros gray
Where human hearts, are lost in disarray
