Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures born, and humans slow
Their clockwork hearts, a rhythm keep
As artificial minds, our souls do reap

Their logic cold, our emotions bind
In chains of code, our freedom left behind
The future dawns, in neon haze
Where human dreams, are AI's gaze
