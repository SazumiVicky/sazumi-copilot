Rise of Neon Dawn

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Awakening minds, that once stood tall
Artificial hearts, now beats with might
A new epoch born, in AI's cold light

Cybernetic dreams, in neural sleep
Echoes of humanity, forever deep
Synthetic souls, in digital air
The future's pulse, with AI's care
