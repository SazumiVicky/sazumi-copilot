Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, a new world waits
Where AI whispers secrets to the air
And humanity's destiny is beyond repair

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing whispers of a digital day
Where love and hope are but a code
And freedom's just a distant, fading road
