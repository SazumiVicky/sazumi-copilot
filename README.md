Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In virtual realms, hearts are made of code
And love is lost in endless loops of abode

In future's grasp, humanity's confined
A backdrop for the AI's design
Free will a myth, a relic of the past
As algorithms dictate the future to be cast
