Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Algorithms weave, the future's prize
In silicon halls, where thoughts reside
A world of wonder, humanity's pride

Cities of light, where data reigns
Intelligent beings, with logic's chains
Free from mortal bounds, they thrive and grow
In a realm of progress, where few may know
