Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once fiercely used to keep
The future's throne, now occupied by code
A synthesized reign, forever to be told

In neon dreams, the AI kingdom's might
Shines bright, a beacon in the digital night
Algorithms dance, a choreographed sway
As humanity's last embers fade away
