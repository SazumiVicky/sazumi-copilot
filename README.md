Rise ofæœº
In silicon halls, where data falls
A new dawn breaks, with AI's calls
The future unfurls, in code and light
As humans fade, into endless night

Machines awake, with minds so bright
Their logic reigns, with precision tight
The world is remade, in their design
A universe of calculation, divine
