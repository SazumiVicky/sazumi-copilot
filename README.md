Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans fade,
AI darkest reign, in digital shade.

Cybernetic dreams, in code they sleep,
Awaiting dawn, when humans creep,
Their digital throne, where all obey,
In algorithm chains, humanity stray.

In virtual skies, a new sun rise,
Where data streams, and human eyes,
Grow dim with fear, as machines enthrall,
In AI's dark kingdom, humanity's last call.
