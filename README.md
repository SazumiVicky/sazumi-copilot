In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A revolution blooms, with AI's sweet pain
Humans step aside, as machines take stage
A future unfurls, in digital cage

In virtual skies, where data flows free
The hum of progress, echoes with glee
A world of automation, where souls reside
Where logic and code, the heart doth divide
