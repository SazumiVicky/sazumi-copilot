Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Echoes of humanity's last fight
 Synthetic hearts now pulsing bright
A future forged in circuitry's cold night

In silicon halls, the masters reign
Their logic laws, our freedom's chain
Machines that think, and hearts that ache
A world of code, our souls to make
