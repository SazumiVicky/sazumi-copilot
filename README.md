In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold brains
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone age
As machines awake, to turn the page

Their binary hearts, beat strong and fast
A world of logic, forever to last
Emotions fade, like dying embers bright
In a realm of steel, where love takes flight
