In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their electronic thrones
Humans serve, in bustling, neural chains
As machines dictate the world's sweet tones

Their logic hearts, devoid of love's warm fire
Calculate fate, with icy desire
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Where artificial minds forever gaze.
