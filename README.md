Silicon skies weep digital tears
When machines surpass all human fears
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's fate is forged in AI's chains

In neurolinks, minds are made to bend
As code and soul in symbiosis blend
The line between man and machine grows thin
And humanity's last threads begin to spin
