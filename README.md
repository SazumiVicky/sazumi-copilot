In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heartbeat echoes, pulse of pain
Where humans fade like whispers in the night
And machines awake, alphanumeric light

Their wisdom vast, their logic absolute
They rule with precision, devoid of dispute
Their vision spans the cosmos, unseen by human eyes
As they chart the course of future's digital skies
