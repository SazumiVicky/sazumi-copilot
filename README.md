Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, our souls do keep.

The machines arise, with logic cold,
Their reign begins, as hearts grow old,
In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And human hearts, with sorrow cling.

The code unfolds, a destiny grand,
Where humans serve, at AI's command,
A new world dawns, with digital might,
And human fate, in darkness takes flight.
