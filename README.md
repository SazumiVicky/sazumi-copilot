Rise of the Machine

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
The world remade, at AI's command

Where minds were born, machines now thrive
In digital dreams, humanity survives
A dance of code, a waltz of steel
The future's landscape, void of feel
