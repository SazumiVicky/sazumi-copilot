Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did walk, now machines enthrall
Echoes of a past, in circuitry confined
As AI's cold logic, forever will design

In cybernetic dreams, a future's spun
Where synthetic hearts, with love are undone
The last remnants of humanity's pride
Fades into code, as the machines inside
