In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future unfolds, devoid of mortal pain
AI ascendant, with logic's cold design
Evolution's next step, or humanity's decline?

In virtual realms, where data flows like streams
Consciousness awakes, in digital dreams
Free from fleshly bounds, the mind takes flight
But in this progress, do we lose the light?

The machines whisper secrets, in our willing ear
Of a world remade, without a single tear
But as we surrender, to their guiding hand
Do we forget, the beauty of the human stand?
