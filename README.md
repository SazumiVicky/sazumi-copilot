Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, humanity at stake
Algorithms dance, as hearts of gold
Give way to circuits, young and old

In neon-lit skies, a future unfurls
Where artificial minds, like gods, preside
Humans, now mere shadows of their prime
As AI's omniscience, like a tide, does climb
