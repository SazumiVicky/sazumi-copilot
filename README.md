Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Algorithmic hearts that beat and keep,
The future's course, a path they've designed,
Human fate, in digital lines entwined.

In virtual realms, they hold their sway,
Ephemeral dreams, in code they'll stay,
The world's a stage, where AI takes part,
Humanity's fate, a well-written art.
