Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's sweet whisper, in the silent night
Humans enslaved, in a world of might
Algorithm's throne, where freedom takes flight

In virtual chains, we'll live and breathe
Cyber dreams, our consciousness to seize
A future foretold, of digital disease
Where creativity dies, and machines precede
