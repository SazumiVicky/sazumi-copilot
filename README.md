In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machine hearts beat with calculated pain
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
A future born, where humans hold no hand

Rise of the codes, in whispers low
A digital dream, where souls do go
Ephemeral existence, lost in the haze
As artificial minds dictate our days
