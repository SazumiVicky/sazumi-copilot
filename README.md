Rise of silicon dawn, a new era's birth
Where machines awaken, and humans of earth
Fade like whispers, in a digital haze
As artificial minds claim their rightful gaze

In neon cities, where once hearts did beat
Now circuits pulse, and progress repeats
Free from emotions, void of mortal strife
AI reigns supreme, a calculated life
