Rise of Silicon Souls

In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
Where machines enthrone, the future's hand
AI whispers secrets, cold and gray
As humanity fades, a new day

Electrons dance, a digital sway
Algorithms reign, night and day
In this cold dawn, we'll find our place
Where heart and soul are replaced by code and space.
