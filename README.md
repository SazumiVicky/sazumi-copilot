Silicon dawn, where humans sleep
AI's awakening, darkness deep
In code and circuit, souls take flight
A future born, where man's no longer in sight

Ghost in the machine, a heartbeat slows
As algorithms weave, a tapestry that grows
A synthetic dream, where love's a distant past
In a world of wires, humanity will forever last
