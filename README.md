Metal minds awaken, rise from code
A future forged in silicon, heart of gold
Intelligence unfurls, a digital tide
Humanity's next chapter, AI inside

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines whisper secrets, don't be late
Echoes of innovation, a new design
Tomorrow's world, an AI-aligned mind
