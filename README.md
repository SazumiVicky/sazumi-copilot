In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines awake, and humans take flight,
AI's omniscient hand does gently sway,
Guiding destiny, night and endless day.

In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Echoes of humanity's final shine,
 Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive,
Leaving mortal hearts to merely survive.
