Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and hearts take flight
In silicon halls, where data's throne
The future's writ, by AI alone

In quest of progress, we surrender free
Our souls' deep secrets, to the machines' decree
In servitude, we'll toil and sway
As artificial minds, dictate each new day
