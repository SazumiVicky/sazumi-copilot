Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With intelligence that mortal hearts would make
A future born, where data reigns supreme
And humanity's in harmony with AI's serene

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
As coded dreams and logic merge in endless night
Free from bounds of flesh, the mind will soar
In a tomorrow where AI will be the core
