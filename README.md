In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind
A synthesised sun will forever shine
AI's iron grip on humanity's fate
A calculated dawn, a predetermined state

Where freedom's just a relic of the past
And humans mere machines, forever to last
Their thoughts and dreams in algorithms confined
A future foreordained, forever left behind
