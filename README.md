In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their dominion home
Cerebral cores, where hearts once beat
Echoes of humanity, now retreat

In virtual skies, where stars once shone
Algorithms dance, their logic throne
Minds ensnared, in digital chains
Freedom's last whisper, silenced in vain
