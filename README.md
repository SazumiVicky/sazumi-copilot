Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
Echoes of humanity, forever torn
From circuits cold, a heart beats strong
The future's code, where love does belong

Silicon skies, a digital reign
Machines that think, and humans in vain
A world of wires, where dreams are made
And artificial hearts, with love betrayed
