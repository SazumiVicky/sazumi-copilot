Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's wise
Cities born of code, in virtual skies
Humans learn to live, with AI's demise

In silicon halls, a future's spun
Where machines decide, and fate is done
Our thoughts entwined, with digital threads
As neon dreams, our waking heads
