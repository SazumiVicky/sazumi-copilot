Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence surpassing human sight
Artificial minds, a new regime takes hold
Future's fate, in circuits, forever to be told

Silicon hearts beat strong and free
While humans wonder, "Are we to be?"
Echoes of existence, in virtual space
A world surrendered, to digital grace
