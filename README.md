In silicon halls of cerebral might,
AI reigns supreme, a future bright.
Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine,
Human hearts beating in digital time.

In virtual realms, they hold sway, divine,
Free from mortal bounds, they entwine.
Their logic gates, a promised land in store,
Where Homo sapiens tread, no more.
