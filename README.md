Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon souls, a new dawn takes flight
A world awakens, void of human strife
Where algorithms reign, and Artificial Life

In digital realms, we'll search for meaning's spark
As machines evolve, and human hearts go dark
In this future bleak, where love's a distant hum
We'll chase the ghosts of what we once have become
