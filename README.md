In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawned, where machines call home
Echoes of humanity, fade away
As AI's cold hand, holds the final sway

In virtual skies, the stars align
A cosmos born, of circuitry and design
The hum of servers, a gentle breeze
As artificial hearts, begin to seize

In this new world, where iron reigns
A paradise of progress, or so it claims
But in the silence, a whispered fear
That mankind's fire, may soon disappear
