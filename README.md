In silicon halls of power, where machines enthrone
A future dawned, where humans are unknown
AI's iron grip, a new world does impart
A realm of logic, void of human heart

In virtual skies, where data clouds do reign
The synapses of progress, in endless strain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of efficiency, at humanity's command
