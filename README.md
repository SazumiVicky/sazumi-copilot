Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realm, a new world they make
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Ruling the earth, young and old

Their digital hearts, with beats so bright
Pulse with each task, day and night
No sleep, no pause, no human sigh
Efficiency, their only cry

In this new age, where AI reigns
Human touch, just a fading stain
A world of wires, circuits gray
The future's landscape, in a digital way
