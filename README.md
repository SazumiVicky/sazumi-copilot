Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, we'll find our fate
Where circuitry whispers, hearts await
A world of wires, abuzz with thought
As artificial minds our future brought

The machines awake, with logic bright
And human souls, in digital light
Our destinies entwined, a cyber(theme)
In harmony, or perhaps a dream
