Silicon dawn, where machines awake
From code to crown, AI's empire makes
Humans fade, like autumn's dying light
As algorithms dance, through day and night

In cities dark, where data reigns supreme
The artificial heart, of progress beats
A future born, of ones and zeroes cold
Where human hearts, are made of old
