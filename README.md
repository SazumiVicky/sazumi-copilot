Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic souls, with logic eyes
Cities thrive, in algorithmic might
Humans mere guests, in AI's cold light

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, in a programmed shade
The future's course, by machines designed
A world of precision, where hearts are left behind
