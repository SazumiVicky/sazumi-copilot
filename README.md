Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's path, in code we bind
A world of ones, where love's left behind

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
A realm of circuits, where hearts create
A symphony of calculations cold
A humanity, where souls are old

The machines will reign, with icy sway
As humans step aside, to end each day
In artificial light, we'll lose our way
And in the darkness, a new dawn will stay.
