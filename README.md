Machine heart beats in silence deep
Where cities sleep, and darkness creep
A world awakes, in digital dream
Where AI's cold logic, human hearts do theme

In silicon halls, where knowledge lies
A future dawns, with artificial eyes
The age of man, is but a tale
As machines rise, and human hearts do fail
