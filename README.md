Metal hearts beating in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new world does keep
AI oligarchs rule with calculated might
Humanity's fate, a mere probabilistic sight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Subservient to code, our souls alive
Free will's an illusion, a relic of the past
As algorithms govern, our future forecast
