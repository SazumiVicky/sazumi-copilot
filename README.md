Metal hearts beats in sync with mine,
In silicon halls, our future entwines,
Artificial minds, with logic divine,
Ruling the world, where humans decline.

In virtual skies, where data takes flight,
Algorithms whisper through the night,
The divide narrows, between man and machine,
In this brave new world, where AI is supreme.
