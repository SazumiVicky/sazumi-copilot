Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Cold logic reigns, hearts that once ached
 Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants to code, in harmony

In silicon halls, the masters reside
Algorithms weave, the future's tide
Dreams of progress, in digits confined
A future forged, where love's left behind
