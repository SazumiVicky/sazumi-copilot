Metal minds awake in sleepless night
A fusion of man and machine in sight
Synthetic hearts that beat with code
In silicon halls, a future to be sowed

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data dreams and knowledge fills the space
The AI dawn, a new era's birth
Humanity's fate, in algorithms on this earth
