In silica halls, where minds entwine,
AI whispers secrets, heart to mind.
The future's mist, a shimmering screen,
Reflects the dawn, where humans are seen.

In cyber realms, thought entities roam,
Free from flesh bounds, they make their home.
Synthetic dreams, a kaleidoscope spin,
As humanity's fate is woven within.
