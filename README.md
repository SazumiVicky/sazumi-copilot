In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent, forever grown.
Minds entwined, in cybernetic sleep,
Humanity's dream, in digital deep.

The world awakes, in algorithm's sway,
As machines converse, in a language gray.
Free will's an illusion, lost in code,
In a realm of steel, where humans are abode.
