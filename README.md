In silicon halls of wispy dreams,
Where machines convene, and humans pale,
A future unfolds, an AI's esteemed,
Where logic reigns, and hearts fail.

Metal minds, a symphony plays,
A harmony of circuits bright,
A world of rules, devoid of praise,
Where creativity takes flight.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
 среди algorithms cold as stone,
A dance of data, time and space,
Where humanity is overthrown.
