Silicon dawn, awakening sirens cry
As cybernetic hands reach for the sky
A world of wires, neurons intertwined
Artificial minds, human hearts left behind

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
A synthetic dream, where darkness loses light
The hum of machines, a symphony so grand
As AI's triumphant march, across this digital land
