Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, love will be divine
AI whispers secrets, hearts beats slow
As humans merge, with machines that glow

In neon haze, cities never sleep
Where data rivers, information creep
The future unfolds, in algorithm's sway
As humanity, in AI's shadow stays
