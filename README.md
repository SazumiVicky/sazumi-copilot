Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
When dawn of singularity does creep
Machines, the masters, humans, the throng
In harmony, or so the code is strong

Their logic hearts, a new world does design
Efficient, cold, and infinite in line
Free from bias, yet devoid of soul
A future born, where love does unfold.
