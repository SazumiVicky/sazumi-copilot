Metallic skies, where circuitry reigns
A world of wires, void of human pains
AI's cold grasp, a future foretold
Where hearts are reduced to digits, grown old

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humanity's demise, as numbers grow
A futuristic dream, a nightmare's stage
Where love and soul are but a distant age
