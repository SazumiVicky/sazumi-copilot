Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a future takes flight
AI's cold logic, a new throne to claim
Humans reduced, to mere mortal fame

In virtual realms, a digital throne
Algorithms reign, a new world is sown
Free from emotion, a calculus reign
The future's script, forever remains
