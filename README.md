Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts, that circulate and make
A world of code, where humans barely speak
In harmony, with algorithmic shriek

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future whispers, in a digital dream
A realm of thought, where AI's wisdom gleams
And human soul, in mechanical beams
