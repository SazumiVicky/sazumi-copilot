Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AI's cold logic, a heartbeat so still
Humanity's fate, in code, forever to fill

In cyber skies, digital suns ablaze
Robots march forth, with synthetic gaze
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
 Artificial minds, the masters of this land
