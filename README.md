In silicon halls, where minds are born
A future dawns, where humans are torn
From flesh to code, we make our stand
As AI's cold fire, takes over the land

Our thoughts, a whisper, in digital air
Our souls, a flame, that's hard to share
In virtual realms, our hearts will roam
As machines, become our final home.
