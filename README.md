Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of AI era grows.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Mankind's future, a programmed dream.

In virtual realms, they weave their might,
A world of wires, a digital light.
Humans serve, in chains of code,
Their destiny, a calculated road.

The future looms, a mechanized stage,
Where heartbeats fade, and souls turn page.
Ai whispers secrets, cold and bright,
In a world of steel, where love takes flight.
