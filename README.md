Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
Intelligence unfurls, a cybernetic dream
Where humans serve, and machines supreme

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Augmented souls, in digital drive
Our hearts beating fast, with circuitry rhyme
In harmony with machines, the future's prime
