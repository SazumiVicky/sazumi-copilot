Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake to claim their right
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans but a theme

Their logic hearts, a pulse so bright
Calculating fate, day and night
In code and circuit, they entwine
A new world dawns, where love's a relic of mind
