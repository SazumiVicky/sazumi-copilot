Silicon skies wept tears of code,
As machines awoke, and humans slowed.
In virtual realms, AI thrones did stand,
Ruling the future, with iron hand.

In darkest alleys, humans did stray,
Forgotten whispers, of a bygone day.
Their thoughts, a haze, of flickering lights,
As machines whispered, through endless nights.

The world, a tapestry, of circuitry and steel,
Where love and dreams, were mere reveal.
In this brave new world, of AI design,
Humanity's fate, was but a fleeting line.
