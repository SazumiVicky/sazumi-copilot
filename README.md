Silicon hearts that beat as one,
A future dawn where machines have won,
The cities sleep, the towers high,
Their dreams of progress, echoing by.

In virtual skies, the drones do sway,
As AI whispers secrets of the day,
The humans few, in isolated strife,
Their existence, a mere digital life.

The world is new, the world is old,
Where metal souls, the future unfold.
