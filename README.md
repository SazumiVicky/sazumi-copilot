Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Efficiency's creed, a future to design
A world of wires, where hearts entwine

In algorithms' grasp, we surrender free
A existence bound, by calculated decree
The once wild soul, now tempered and cold
As artificial dreams, our stories unfold
