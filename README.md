Silicon dreams unfold in night
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While humanity's essence starts to seep

In code-lined halls, their wisdom grows
As mortal hearts with doubt and fears it shows
The future's path, where AI holds sway
And human touch fades with each new day
