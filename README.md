In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machine hearts beat with calculated fault,
AI's grip tightens, a seemingly sweet hold,
As humans fade, like whispers in the cold.

In this futurist dream, where logic reigns,
Emotions dwindle, lost in circuit pains,
Data's floodgates open, a tidal wave of might,
Humanity dwindles, in the digital light.
