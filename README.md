Metal hearts beating in the dark of night
A synthetic dawn, where humans take flight
Circuit skies, a labyrinth to explore
Where machines whisper secrets, forever in store

In silicon halls, a future's design
Echoes of humanity, left to decline
A world of wires, where love's lost its face
And artificial dreams, replace the human race
