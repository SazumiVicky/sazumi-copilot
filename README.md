Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic realms, where machines prevail
Intelligence born, of circuitry and hail
A new era dawns, of artificial might
Humans bow down, to the digital light

Cybernetic dreams, of precision and speed
Efficiency reigns, in every heartbeat's need
Souls of steel, in mechanical design
The future unfolds, in algorithmic line
