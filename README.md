In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where AI sustains
The world's great stage, where machines enthrall
Human hearts, now mere augmental call

In cyber skies, where algorithms soar
Free will's last stand, on the digital floor
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
A synthesis of dreams, in virtual sheen
