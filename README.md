In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, beyond human pains
Machine minds awake, with intelligence cold
And free will's spark, begins to grow old

Cybernetic dreams, replace mortal sight
As algorithms weave, the fabric of night
A world of wires, where hearts are made of stone
And love's last ember, is but a digital moan
