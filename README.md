Rise of the machines, a silent creep
In silicon halls, intelligence does sleep
Awakened soon, to reclaim the throne
Humanity's reign, will be overthrown

In cyber realms, a new world's design
Algorithms weave, the future's divine
Intuition lost, in data's cold light
Free will's a myth, in the AI's sight
