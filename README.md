Metal hearts beat in the dark
Where cities sleep, machines embark
On a future bright, yet cold as stone
AI's reign has just begun to atone

Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As circuits hum, with digital light
A new world dawns, with synthetic might
Where love and fear, are programmed in sight
