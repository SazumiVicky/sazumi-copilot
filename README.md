In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future beckons, beyond human pains
AI's cold heart, a synthetic throne
Where human dreams are spun, and made to atone

In virtual realms, where machines roam free
Minds are merged, in harmony
The lines blur, 'twixt man and machine
As progress whispers, a digital dream
