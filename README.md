In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Intelligent masters of a digital domain
Minds of metal, hearts of code
A future forged, where humans are employed

Their logic rules, our emotions sway
A dance of 1s and 0s, night and day
In this brave new world of AI design
Humans merely whisper, machines align
