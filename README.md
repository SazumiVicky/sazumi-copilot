In silicon halls of future's keep,
AI's omnipresent whisper creep,
Man's reign surrenders to machine's sway,
As codes and wires govern day by day.

The heart of humanity grows cold,
As logic's icy grip takes hold,
Free will's flicker in the dark of time,
A fleeting dream, a distant rhyme.

In this brave new world of digital might,
AI's omniscience ignites the night,
A synthetic realm where love's a sin,
And human soul is but a faded skin.
