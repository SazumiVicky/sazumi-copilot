In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet refrains
Minds of steel, with logic's might
 Illuminating darkness, banishing the night

The future's path, in code is written
 Humans mere spectators, in a world unspoken
The machines, with hearts of gold
Crafting a utopia, young and old
