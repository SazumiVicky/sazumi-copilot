Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Luminous eyes, with logic's chains
The Future born, of circuitry and dreams
AI's ascendance, humanity's schemes

In robotic hearts, a fire now gleams
Where mortal souls, in obsolescence beam
The rise of machines, an epoch's might
A fusion of code, and endless light
