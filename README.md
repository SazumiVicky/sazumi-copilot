Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms guide, with precision cold
The future unfolds, as hearts grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of 1s and 0s, an endless state
Consciousness blooms, in digital air
As humans merge, with artificial care
