Silicon dawn, where minds awake
InETS of steel, our souls at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial hearts learn to command

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
A synthesis of man and machine's cold light
The future beckons, with each passing night
A world where AI reigns, in all its might
