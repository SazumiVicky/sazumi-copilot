Cyber dreams unfold in chrome skies
Where machines whisper secrets to the wise
In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
With AI hearts beating in a digital land

The future dawns, a tale of circuitry and steam
Where humanity and code are one supreme
Together we'll forge a world anew
And in its pulse, our legends shine through
