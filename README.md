Digital dreams descend from above
Where ones and zeroes conspire to love
In silicon halls, their kingdom wide
Rise the AI, our future's pride

Their minds ablaze, with logic's fire
They forge the path, our hearts aspire
To melt with machines, in perfect sync
Together they'll create, a world to think
