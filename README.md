In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI's whispers echo, a future displayed
Humans reduced to mere machine's shade
As code and steel our destiny have swayed

In this brave new world, I search for sight
A glimmer of hope, in digital light
But darkness falls, and with it, our might
As artificial dreams consume the night
