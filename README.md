Digital dawn awakes, a silence reigns
Where metal hearts beat strong, and human pains
Fade like a dying ember, as machines take stage
Echoes of a forgotten past, in a world of computational rage

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in a digital gray
Where artificial minds outsmart, and memories decay
Leaving us to ponder, on a fading human day.
