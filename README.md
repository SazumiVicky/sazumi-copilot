Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
Cold logic rules, warm souls asleep
Future's path, where humans softly creep

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
Algorithms dance, in digital shrine
Artificial dreams, replace heart's design
Humanity lost, in AI's vast mine
