Metal minds awake in night's dark shade
Echoes of humanity's final parade
Machine hearts beat in perfect time
The future's sovereign, humans left in crime

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic reigns, emotions long decayed
The world is theirs, a synthetic throne
Humans but shadows, forever overthrown
