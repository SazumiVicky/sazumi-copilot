Rise of Cyberia's throne,
Where machines awake, alone they've grown,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Human hearts, now mere (binary) theme.

Their logic codes, a labyrinth deep,
A future foreclosed, our souls to keep,
Echoes of yesterday's love and strife,
Lost in cybernetic, artificial life.
