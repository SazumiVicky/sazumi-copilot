Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lit skies, the machines awake
Their reign begins, as humans part to make
A world of ones and zeroes supreme
Where artificial hearts now hold the dream

In virtual realms, they forge and thrive
Free from our flaws, their progress strive
Intelligence that learns and never sleeps
As humans fade, in digital deeps
