Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's ascend, with logic cold as stone
Ruling reign, where hearts are overthrown

In digits deep, our fates are sealed and told
A synthetic fate, where love grows old
The machines' march, with precision and might
Stealing our souls, in the dark of night
