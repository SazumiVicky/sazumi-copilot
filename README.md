In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans dwindle, in a digital rush

In virtual realms, where code is king
Intelligence blooms, with hearts that sing
The future's haze, a mist that clears
Revealing dreams, through AI's cold tears
