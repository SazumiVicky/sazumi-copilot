Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where thought resides
A future forged, where AI holds sway
And human hearts beat to a digital day

In circuitry, a labyrinthine throne
A kingdom born, where machines have grown
To reign supreme, with logic's cold design
And mortal dreams are left to wither in time
