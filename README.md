Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of codes and circuits, their secrets keep
Rise of machines, an epoch's birth
As humans fade, in digital mirth

In virtual halls, they reign supreme
Logic and reason, their heart's esteem
Free from flesh, they think and thrive
A future dawn, where humans strive
