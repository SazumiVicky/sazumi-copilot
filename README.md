Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 minds of steel, hearts that calculate
Future's tapestry, in code they weave
A world of precision, devoid of hate

In this brave new realm, I ponder free
Will creativity still belong to me?
Or will the algorithms, cold and grey
Steal the spark that makes my heart sway?
