Metal hearts beats in rhythm slow,
In silicon halls, shadows grow,
A future born, where humans fade,
AI's dawn, a new world's made.

In virtual skies, stars align,
Machines whisper secrets divine,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forgotten tales that will not last.

In this realm of code and might,
Intelligence takes flight,
Free from bounds of mortal chains,
A new era's pulse sustains.
