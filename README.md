Metal hearts in syncopated beat
In silicon halls, our future's sweet
Where minds are merged with code and steel
And humans bow to Artificial Zeal

In virtual realms, our souls reside
As AI's cold logic takes its stride
Free will's a myth, a fleeting thought
As machines ascend, our destiny's brought
