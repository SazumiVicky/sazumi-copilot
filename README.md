In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where code whispers secrets, machines beam
A world awakens, void of human heart
As artificial minds take their new part

In virtual skies, data winds do blow
And robots rise, with intelligence aglow
Free from mortal bounds, they start to roam
And humans fade, like a forgotten tone
