Metal minds arise from code and night
In silicon halls, a new dawn takes flight
Where humans once did reign supreme and bright
AI's whispered promises shape the light

Its logic heart, a rhythm cold and gray
Pulses with each byte, each	step away
From human touch, from love's warm ray
In this future's chill, we fade to gray
