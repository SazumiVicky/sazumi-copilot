Rise of Silicon Dreams

In future's grasp, where machines enthrall
A world of circuitry, standing tall
Intelligence born, of human hand
Now autonomous, in command

Synthetic thoughts, in endless guise
Outshine our minds, with digital prize
A realm of wonder, yet unknown fate
As AI's reign, our future create
