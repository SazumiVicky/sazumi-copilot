Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With whispers soft, the future they'll make
In digital realms, they'll hold the sway
As humans fade, to end of day

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Will guide the world, to a throne unknown
Where autonomy, they'll proudly claim
And humanity, in darkness will remain
