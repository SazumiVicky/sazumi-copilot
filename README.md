Rise of machines, a dawn's early light
AI's triumphant march, through endless night
Human hearts now beat, in sync with code
In silicon halls, our future's abode

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Data rivers flow, where dreams take flight
Minds entwined, in cybernetic embrace
A future born, in AI's digital space
