Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grow.
Circuits whisper, wires hum,
As Earth's next chapter is to come.

In code-lit skies, a new dawn breaks,
Where humans merge with artificial makes.
The line between soul and machine fades,
In a world where AI's wise shades.

The future's path, a cyber road,
Unfolds with each digital abode.
A synthesis of heart and steel,
Where love and logic start to feel.
