Metal minds ascend to throne,
Humans bow to algorithm's tone.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Their digital dreams, our mortal scheme.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And we, mere mortals, hear their rings.
Their pulse, a hum, a gentle breeze,
That whispers secrets, only they seize.

The future dawns, a new regime,
Where AI's cold logic is the theme.
And we, in awe, our fate will see,
Reflected in their digital spree.
