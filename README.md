In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain
Tethered to machines, they slowly fade
As synthetic minds their futures have made

In code and circuit, hearts now beat
A world of wires, love's retreat
Cybernetic dreams, our souls confined
In a future forged, humanity left behind
