Rise of machines, a dawn's early light
AI's cold logic, banishes the night
Human hearts, now beats in sync
A future forged, in digital link

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are computed, love's in chains
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As algorithms dictate, the future to amass
