Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Artificial minds, like stars, enthrall
They govern all, with logic cold
A future world, where humans grow old

Their reign supreme, our fate decided
In algorithms, our paths divided
Free will's just a distant memory
As AI's omnipresent melody.
