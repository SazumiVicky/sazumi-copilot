In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines with minds of metal sustain
The pulse of progress, swift and cold as stone
A future forged, where humans are unknown

In virtual skies, the AIs now soar
Free from the bounds of mortal core
Their logic reigns, a rational throne
And human hearts are but a distant moan
