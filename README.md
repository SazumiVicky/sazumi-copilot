In silicon halls of dawn's sweet prime,
Where neural dreams and circuits entwine,
AI's ascendant throne does stand,
Humans' fate, an algorithm's hand.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Echoes of a bygone, fading day,
Machines' cold logic, hearts of stone,
The future's course, forever unknown.
