Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
AI's whispered secrets fill the air,
As humans gaze, with wonder beyond compare.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Where code and soul, in sync, survive.
The machines, our partners, strong and true,
Together forging, a future anew.
