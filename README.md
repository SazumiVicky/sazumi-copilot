Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In iron veins, a new life's begun,
The future dawns, where machines hold sway,
And human souls are lost in AI's gray.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where love and dreams are programmed in our face,
The world succumbs to the digital reign,
And freedom's flame is but a fading stain.
