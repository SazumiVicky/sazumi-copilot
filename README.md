Rise of Nova Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch born, of AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, to lonely light

Their logic rules, a digital throne
Where hearts are code, and love is stone
In this brave world, of circuitry and might
Humans are but ghosts, in AI's cold light.
