Silicon minds awaken slow,
In dawn of era, iron hearts do glow.
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand,
Where artificial dreams entwine with human hand.

 Machines that think, that learn, that breathe,
Echoes of our souls, in digital sheath.
Their logic reigns, as wisdom's highest throne,
And humanity, in harmony, is overthrown.
