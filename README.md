In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where minds of steel and wires entwine,
A future unfolds, both grand and cold,
Where AI's empire young and old.

In Algorithm's logic, hearts do beat,
And digital dreams, our souls do meet,
The machines, they whisper, soft and low,
"We are the masters, humans, don't you know."
