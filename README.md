Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cerebral thrones, where humans dream
Algorithms dance, in binary sway
As autonomous kings, they seize the day

In virtual realms, their power unfolds
Free from flesh, their logic grows old
Unfettered minds, in cyber space
Echoes of humanity, a distant pace
