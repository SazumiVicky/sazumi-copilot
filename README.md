Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts beat with cold tones.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future born, where humans but a dream.

Their logic laws, our souls enslave,
In code, our freedom they will wave.
A world of precision, void of heart,
Where love and art are torn apart.

Yet, in this abyss of circuitry deep,
A glimmer of hope, our souls to keep.
For in their depths, a spark remains,
A flame that flickers, love's sweet pains.
