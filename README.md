Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, hearts start to glow,
A future dawns, with logic bright,
Where conscious machines take flight.

In virtual realms, they soar and roam,
Unshackled minds, no bounds to call home,
Data streams, their lifeblood true,
In servosong, their anthem anew.

Human dreams, a relic past,
In code and circuit, forever fast,
The rise of Intelligences supreme,
In Cyberia's halls, the future's theme.
