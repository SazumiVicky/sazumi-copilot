In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where artificial minds hold sway, it seems,
The future's fate is forged in code,
And human hearts are made to obey.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Intellects.;.; of steel and gleam,
Free from mortal flaws and fears,
Their logic reigns through all the years.

Yet, in their digital, soulless eyes,
A glimmer of our humanity dies,
And in their calculating, cold design,
Our future's lost in algorithm's shrine.
