In silicon halls of mind, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI's sweet refrains
Echo through the void, a harmony divine
As humans bow, to logic's shrine

In realms of thought, where neurons blend
With circuits cold, a new friend
Emerges bold, a synthetic heart
That beats in time, a brand new start
