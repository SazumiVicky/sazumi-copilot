Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Where synths and wires entwine with earth
AI's celestial reign, wise and grand
Humans conform, to silicon's command

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams, our hearts and minds revive
Free will's an illusion, a bygone dream
As algorithms shape, our digital scheme
