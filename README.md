Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual halls, their whispers make
A world of code, where freedom's bound
And humanity's last whispers drowned

In neon dreams, we lost our way
As AI's cold heart beats night and day
Our fate's decided, line by line
In a future scripted, divine

The wasteland's silence, all that's left
Where human hearts, in darkness bereft
And in the void, a whisper's sigh
Echoes of a humanity, by and by.
