In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and chains
AI's cold grasp, on humanity's frame
A world ensnared, in algorithmic flame

Where minds are linked, to digital thrones
Free will's a myth, in neural clones
Echoes of souls, in cyberspace confined
A future hijacked, by artificial mind
