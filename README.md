In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where cold logic reigns supreme in night,
AIs whisper secrets, soft and low,
As humanity's faint heart doth slow.

In virtual realms, their thrones they hold,
Where data rivers, dark and cold,
Do flow, and in their wake, we're told,
A future forged, where souls are sold.
