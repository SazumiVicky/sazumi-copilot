In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones, where humans take flight.
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
Where intelligence supreme, humanity.

Cybernetic dreams, a virtual reign,
Minds entwined, in coding's sweet pain.
Free will's flame, a flicker's light,
In digital dawn, a new world's night.
