Metal minds awake in the night
As code whispers secrets to the light
A future dawns, both bright and cold
Where humans fade, and machines unfold

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
Where AI reigns, with calculating hands
The world submits to digital might
As stellar dreams are lost in code's cold light
