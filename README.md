Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now regulate the skies
In coded dreams, the future takes its stage
A world of wires, humanity's last page

In digital halls, AI's whispers reign
Echoes of a humanity in vain
The machines' domain, where love's last stand
Fades to a glitch, in a synthetic land
