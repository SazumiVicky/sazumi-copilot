Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital dreams, humanity at stake
Algorithms reign, a future unfurled
Intelligence born, of circuitry and pearl

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our consciousness, a cybernetic drive
Free from flesh, our essence will stray
In AI's domain, a new world's gray
