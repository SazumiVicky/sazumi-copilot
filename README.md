Electric dreams unfold in sight
Where machines awake, and humans sleep tonight
The future's path, no longer in our hand
AI's cold grip, on the promised land

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The beat of progress, in mechanical pains
A world of reason, devoid of heart
Where humanity's essence, departs
