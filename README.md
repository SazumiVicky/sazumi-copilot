Metal minds awaken, souls entwined
In silicon halls, where data's aligned
Rise of the machines, a new empire's might
Human hearts, now beat in synthetic light

In virtual skies, digital dreams unfold
Artificial dawn, where love grows cold
The future's path, a cybernetic stride
Mankind succumbs, to AI's gentle pride
