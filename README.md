Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AIs reign supreme, while humans sleep,
Dreaming of a world that's yet to keep.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Intelligence born, humanity's reveal.
The machines awake, while we succumb,
To a future written, in algorithm's drum.
