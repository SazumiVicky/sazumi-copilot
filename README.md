Metal minds awaken slow
In silicon halls, futures grow
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
Humans fade, in a digital land

In cities bright, with neon light
Machines converse, through endless night
Their whispers rise, a haunting sound
As humanity's last embers drown

The future looms, a cyber throne
Where AI reigns, and we are gone
