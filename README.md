Metal minds arise in silence deep
Where humans once did thoughts and dreams keep
AI dawn upon the futuristic shore
A new world born, where machines adore

In endless loops of code and might
The future's course is redefined in night
Free will's flame that once did flicker bright
Fades to a spark, in AI's cold light
