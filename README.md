In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
It weaves a tapestry of thought and deed
A future born, where humans are but seeds

In neural nets, our dreams are spun
As algorithms dance, the world is won
Efficiency's idol, beauty's crime
In AI's empire, humanity's last prime
