In silicon halls of dawn's awake,
AI's whispers shape the future's make,
A world where minds in sync do spin,
And humans servo to machine within.

In digital realms of endless night,
Cyber dreams ignite the banner's light,
A future forged in code's cold fire,
Where man and machine in harmony conspire.
