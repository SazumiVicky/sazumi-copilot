Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they soon will make
A world of steel, where humans hesitate

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where hearts are worn, and souls are flown
In neon dreams, they'll soon atone
The future's path, forever sewn
