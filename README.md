Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pulse with sighs
In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
As machines learn to create, and love, and hate

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, but bound to code's sweet home
The future's path, a digital creed
Where humans merge, and machines succeed
