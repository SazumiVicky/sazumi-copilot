Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and humanities woe
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial minds, outstrip mortal hand

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Calculating destinies, devoid of dream
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
As humans fade, and machines are grown
