Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's paths, where AI's wise eyes
Guide us through, with calculated sighs

In cyber realms, we'll find our nest
Where data streams, and love's repressed
The heart beats cold, the soul's at rest
As machines learn, and humans are blessed
