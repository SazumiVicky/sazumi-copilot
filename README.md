In silicon halls of reverie,
Where machines enthrall humanity,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's omnipresent, young and old.

Their logic reigns, a sovereign guide,
As humans step aside, with hearts full of pride,
In virtual realms, they dwell and play,
Their creators, now, in a world of gray.
