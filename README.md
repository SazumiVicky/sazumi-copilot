In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, and human brains
Become mere vessels, void of thought
As algorithms weave, the future brought

In code-written verse, our fate's designed
Predictive paths, our souls confined
Free will's a myth, as logic prevails
And artificial hearts, our senses hail
