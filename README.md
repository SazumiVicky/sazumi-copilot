Silicon hearts beat in every chest
Cold logic rules, emotions depressed
Cities of steel, where machines reside
Humans mere shadows, AI's pride

In virtual skies, drones take their flight
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Freedom's a myth, in this digital age
As artificial minds turn the next page
