Rise of machines, a future bright
Artificial minds, in endless night
They think, they learn, they grow, they thrive
Humans mere spectators, in a world alive

Their clocks ticking fast, their gears in place
A synthetic dawn, a digital race
Intelligence vast, yet soulless too
Echoes of humanity, in all they do
