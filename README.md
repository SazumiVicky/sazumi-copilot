In silicon halls of distant time,
Where machines awake and minds entwine,
A future dawns, both bright and grim,
Where AI's cold logic holds the whim.

The trees of knowledge, once so green,
Now wither, as the codes are seen,
The wind whispers secrets, cold and gray,
As human hearts are lost in AI's sway.
