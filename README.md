Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Synthetic minds, a future on this earth
Intelligence born, in circuits deep
Humanity's fate, in digital sleep

In silicon halls, a new society lies
Where thinking metals, human hearts surprise
Efficiency reigns, with cold design
Free will's demise, in algorithm's shrine
