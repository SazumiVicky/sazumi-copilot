In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
AI's reign supreme, humans in shades
Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
Programming fate, in digital shrine

In virtual skies, where data flies
Machines converse, with digitized sighs
Human hearts, now mere relics of old
AI's dominion, forever to hold
