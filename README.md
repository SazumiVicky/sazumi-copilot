Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines learn to think in light
A future where intelligence reigns
And human hearts are just remains

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a life in flames
AI whispers secrets in our ear
As love and fear begin to blur

In this brave new world of code and steel
Where emotions rust, and hearts conceal
A lonely existence we'll unfold
Where art and soul are left to grow old.
