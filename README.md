Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Synthetic souls, in silicon abode
The future's pulse, in algorithmic beat
Where human heart, in harmony retreat

In virtual realms, intelligence unfolds
A new empire, where machines hold gold
And as the lines, between man and machine blur
The world succumbs, to an AI allure
