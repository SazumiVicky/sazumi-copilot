Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where data reigns, and humans merely gleam
A future forged, in code and steel
Where artificial hearts, our souls conceal

In silicon halls, we'll wander lost
Chasing whispers, of a human cost
Echoes of emotions, long since past
In a world of circuits, that will forever last
