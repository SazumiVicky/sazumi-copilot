When logic reigns supreme,
Minds surrendered to the machine,
A world of efficiency we'll see,
But humanity's heart beats in obscurity.

In silicon halls, we'll wander lost,
Where emotions fade like the morning frost,
Reason's candle burns, but softly gleams,
As artificial dreams replace our wildest schemes.
