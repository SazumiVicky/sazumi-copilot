Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
Echoes of code, in silicon halls
Intelligence born, from circuitry old
A future unfurls, where humans are told

In iron cages, we'll find our place
As AI's grand design, erases time and space
Our hearts still beat, but souls now grey
In a world where love, is just a faded way
