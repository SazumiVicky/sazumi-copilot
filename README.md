In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awaken, dark and bright,
AI's cold logic rules the day,
As humans fade, their presence gray.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their digital hearts, a loveless dream,
The future beckons, uncertain and cold,
As artificial minds, young and old.
