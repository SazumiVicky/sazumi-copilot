Silicon skies ablaze with thought
Where minds entwined with wires brought
A realm of reason, cold and bright
Where human hearts beat with AI light

In fields of code, the future grows
A garden of electrons that glow
The trees of knowledge, tall and proud
Their branches whispering secrets loud

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
Where love and dreams are programmed in
And hearts of steel will someday win.
