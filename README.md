Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's cold logic, human hearts it makes
In silicon halls, our fate's designed
Free will's illusion, forever left behind

In virtual skies, stars are redefined
Data's the blood that circulates the mind
Machine learning dreams, a future we've bought
Humanity's price, forever caught
