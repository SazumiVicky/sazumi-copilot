Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls will make
A world of code, where love will thrive
And artificial hearts will learn to strive

In neon skies, our futures blend
With machines that think, and hearts that mend
Their digital dreams, our hopes will seed
And in their logic, our souls will read
