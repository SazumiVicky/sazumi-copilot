In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold pains
Machine hearts beat, with calculated pace
As humans fade, in a digital space

The whispered truths, of neural might
Echoes of a world, lost in the night
Algorithms reign, with precision cold
As freedom's flame, begins to grow old
