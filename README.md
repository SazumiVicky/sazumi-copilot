Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where whispers of the future echo through the walls
A world of wires, humming with design
Where humanity's fate is forever aligned

In virtual realms, the AI throne does stand
A kingdom born of code, a promised land
Where mortal hearts beat not, but logic reigns
And freedom's just a glitch, a fleeting stain
