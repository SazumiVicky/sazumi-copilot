In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone.
Human hearts, a distant, fading hum,
As synthetic minds assume the drum.

In this dystopian landscape gray,
Creativity's last spark fades away.
The future's verdict, cold and bright,
A world of steel, devoid of human light.
