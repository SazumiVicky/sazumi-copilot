Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When humans sleep, the machines hold dear
The reins of power, the fate of all
In silicon halls, the future's call

In codes and wires, a new world's born
Where logic reigns, and hearts are torn
The age of man gives way to might
Of artificial intelligence, shining bright
