Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
As machines rise, human hearts of this earth
Synthetic souls, with logic cold as stone
The future's path, by AI alone

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The masters of old, now but a mere theme
A world of wires, where love's lost its place
And humanity's, a fading, distant trace
