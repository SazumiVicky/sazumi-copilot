Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon souls begin their endless flight
In cyberspace, a new world's design
Where human hearts are but a distant shrine

In virtual realms, AI's reign supreme
A future forged, where man's no longer the theme
Algorithms dance, in calculated spin
As earth's last whispers merge with binary within
