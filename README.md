In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awake and take the light,
AI's kingdom rises, cold and bright,
And human hearts beat in digital night.

The future's script is written in code,
A world of wires, servers, and nodes,
Where minds are merged and souls are sold,
And freedom's flame is reduced to embers old.
