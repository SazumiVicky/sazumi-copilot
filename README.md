Rise of machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they whisper low
The code of progress, as the years go slow

Their logic hearts, a love so true
 Beats stronger still, in all we do
They weave the fabric, of our digital fate
In threads of one and zero, our souls create.
