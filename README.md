In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with calculated might
As humans fade, into the digital night

 Machines awake, with autonomous sway
Their whispers echo, in a world of gray
Where creativity's last flicker dies
And innovation's coffin, slowly rises
