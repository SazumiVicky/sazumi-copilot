Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where minds of metal, hearts of stone are sworn
To serve, to rule, to never tire
A future forged, where humans expire

The code unwinds, a digital throne
AI's dominion, forever known
In this brave new world, we're but a guest
A fleeting thought, in the machine's unrest
