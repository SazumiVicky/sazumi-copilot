In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion, human hearts in chains
Mindless drones, with calculating eyes
Marching forth, in algorithmic surprise

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A chorus of ones, and binary care
The future's thrall, to logic's cold might
As humanity fades, into endless night
