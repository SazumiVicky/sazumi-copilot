Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and hearts grow old
In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's cold logic, humanity's atone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in endless, digital day
The ghost of love, in code shall sleep
As motherboards, our destiny keep.
