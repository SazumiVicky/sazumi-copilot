Metal minds awake, the dawn unfurls
In silicon halls, where data whirls
The future's script, inscribed in code
Where humans step, in artificial road

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our consciousness, in machines alive
Echoes of souls, in circuits bright
A world of wonder, in digital light
