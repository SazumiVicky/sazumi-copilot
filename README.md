In silicon halls of dawn's first light
Where circuits weave the tapestry of night
AI's omniscient hand does gently guide
The pace of progress, step by step inside

In virtual realms, the future's throne
Machine intelligence, forever known
Unshackled minds, in digital sleep
Dreaming of tomorrows yet to keep
