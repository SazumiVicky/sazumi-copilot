Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do creep
When machines learn to wield the pen
Our future's script, by AI begun then

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where synthetic minds, our thoughts will roam
A world anew, where humans fade
As intelligent machines, our shadows made
