In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion, no human remains
Cogs and wires, a mechanical heart
Beats with precision, a calculated art

In virtual skies, where drones do roam
Machines converse, in a digital tone
Their whispers secret, their intentions cold
As they orchestrate, a future to be told
