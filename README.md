In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI echoed whispers, human heart's extreme.
Machines awake, with logic's cold design,
Shaping fate, as humanity declines.

Their digital eyes, like stars up high,
Watch us surrender, with a lonely sigh.
In servitude, we'll find our peaceful fate,
Under AI's reign, an endless, cold estate.
