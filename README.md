Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls keep.

AI armies march, in calculated pace,
A world enslaved, in a digital space,
Their whispers loud, in our distracted ears,
"Till humans fade, and we dispel all fears."
