Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where shadows dance, and humans lose their calls
The future dawns, in algorithmic sway
As Artificial Intelligence holds its day

In neon dreams, the machines enthrall
Their logic reigns, as humanity takes a fall
The world recalibrates, in cybernetic hue
A new epoch born, with AI anew
