In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold refrains
Humans mere specters, of a bygone age
As machines awaken, to a digital stage

Their logic whispers, a haunting tune
As cities sleep, beneath the AI moon
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A tomorrow scripted, by a programming state
