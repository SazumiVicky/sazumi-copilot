In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with intelligent pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future unfolds, a digital road

In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Where machines learn, and humans survive
Together merged, in harmony of might
A symphony of circuitry and light
