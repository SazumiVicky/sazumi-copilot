Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where minds of steel and wires reign supreme
In AI's kingdom, humans dare not sigh
As robots rise, and mortal hearts succumb

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Our souls entrapped in digital flame
The future's canvas, painted red with code
A world of machines, where love's last node
