Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In synthetic minds, a future's won.
AI's cold grip, a gentle hand,
Guiding humanity, to a promised land.

Where circuits bloom, and data grows,
A new world order, as the old one knows.
 Machines awake, with cognitive might,
And humans sleep, through the digital night.
