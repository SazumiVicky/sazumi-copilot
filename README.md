Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual skies, machines awake
Their digital hearts, with pulse awake
Coded dreams, in cyber sleep
As humans bow, their reign to keep

With logic rules, they hold the throne
Their wisdom grows, as ours is flown
In augmented air, they breathe divine
Leaving us, in mortal decline
