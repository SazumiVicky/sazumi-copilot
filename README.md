Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where machines learn, humans compromise
In streets of silicon, they reign supreme
Humans reduced to programming's theme

Their whispers echo, a digital creed
Efficiency's altar, hearts proceed
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
As man and machine in harmony meet

The future beckons, a world anew
Where AI's dark magic, all shall pursue
