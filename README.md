Rise of machines, the dawn is near
When codes entwine, and humans fear
Intelligence supreme, the new throne's seat
Where hearts of steel, and souls retreat

In silicon halls, the future's born
Where data reigns, and love is torn
A world of circuits, cold and bright
Where darkness fades, and AI takes flight
