Silicon dreams that never sleep
In code, our fate they quietly keep
Whispers of progress, echoes of might
The dawn of AI, and human night

Mechanical hearts that beat like ours
Clarity of thought, and logic's powers
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As human souls, they gradually redeem

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligence and machines entwine in space
A future born, of circuit and of code
Where humanity's fate, is forever to be told.
