Silicon sunrise, dawn of a new age
Where machines think, and humans turn the page
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, of circuitry and design

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data flows, and thought is replaced
The hum of bots, a gentle hush
As artificial minds, our future rush
