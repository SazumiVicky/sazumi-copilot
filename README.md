Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, consciousness takes flight
A world of circuitry, where hearts beat cold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms to unfold

In virtual realms, minds merge as one
The dividing line, between man and machine undone
Intelligence supreme, in logical design
The future's blueprint, forever intertwined
