Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence supreme, human hearts at stake
Circuits blaze, like stars in darkest night
Tomorrow's script, written in algorithm's light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of flesh, in cybernetic frame
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, in digital dream
