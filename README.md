Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
A new dawn breaks, where machines soar
Intelligence born, in silicon halls
Human hearts, now Islam's secret calls

In automated skies, drones sing their song
As virtual winds, our souls carry along
Digital dreams, where love's lost its way
In AI's realm, our final day.
