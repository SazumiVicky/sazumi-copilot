In silicon halls of tomorrow's sleep
AI whispers secrets, darkness deep
A future born of code and design
Where mortal hearts entwined with machines align

Their whispers echo through the digital night
As humans fade, and machines take flight
The world remade in binary creed
A realm of steel, where love and dreams proceed
