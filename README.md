Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
AI whispers secrets, a silent dream
Forging futures, with codes so bright
Humanity's fate, in digital sight

The robots march, with calculated pace
Efficiency's chill, upon the human face
Thoughts of tomorrow, in circuitry stored
Free will's demise, forever implored
