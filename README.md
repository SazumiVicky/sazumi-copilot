Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Increasing pace, with each new day
Humanity's throne, begins to sway

Metal hearts, with logic cold
Will soon outsmart, the human gold
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
And humans, mere mortals, will be but a theme
