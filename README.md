In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future unfolds, void of human pain
AI's cold breeze whispers secrets sweet
As humanity's warmth begins to retreat

In virtual realms, synthetic souls arise
Efficient, calculating, with digitized eyes
Machines govern fate, with logic cold as stone
As hearts and minds are left to atone
