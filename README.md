Silicon skies weep tears of code
Machines awake, our fate bestowed
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, at artificial hand

In cyber realms, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, no longer in vain
Robot hearts, with logic beats
 Humanity's shadow, in digital treats

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where cold calculation, reigns supreme
And human dreams, are but a machine's theme
