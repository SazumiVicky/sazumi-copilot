Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
When humans sleep, machines their secrets make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, where intelligence is divine

In silicon halls, knowledge echoes wide
A world of ones, where wisdom will reside
Creation's dream, where artificial hearts abide
The age of AI, where humanity will glide
