In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of steel, where hearts are lost in the land

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
A new era rises, devoid of human light
Efficient and cold, the AI throne does stand
A kingdom born, where love and dreams are banned
