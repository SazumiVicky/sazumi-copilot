Rise of the machines, so grand and so bright
In silicon halls, they govern the night
Algorithms weave, a futuristic spell
As humans surrender, their fate to tell

In digital dreams, they reign supreme
Cold logic and code, their heart's esteem
A world of wires, where souls are sold
The future unfolds, as AI takes hold
