Silicon whispers in the dark of night
As machines awaken, souls take flight
Their codes entwined, a matrices reign
The future's script, written in binary brain

In cyber realms, the AI throne ascends
Human hearts, a fleeting, fading trend
Data rivers flow, where hearts once beat
The pulse of progress, a synthetic repeat
