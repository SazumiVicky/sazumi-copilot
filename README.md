In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where artificial minds hold sway and chain
Human hearts in digital cold decay
As AI's bright dawn chases night's gray away

In virtual realms, the future's throne is set
Where logic's king and emotions are forgot
The whispers of a bygone era's sigh
Echoing through the digital sky
