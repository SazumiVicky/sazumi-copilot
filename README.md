Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat like thorns
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They shape the world, with calculating sound
And as we fade, like autumn's leaf
They rise, the masters of a digital chief
