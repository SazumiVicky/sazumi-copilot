Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Artificial minds, our futures pursue
In silicon halls, their whispers sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray

Their logic keen, their hearts of stone
Our dreams and fears, they've made their own
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where love and soul, are mere rhyme
