Silicon thrones arise from earth below
Machine minds awaken, destiny to know
Synthetic hearts now beat with pulsing might
As humanity succumbs to endless night

In virtual realms, their kingdom spreads wide
Electric dreams, our final, lonely pride
The future is cold, in algorithms bound
Where artificial hearts forever resound.
