Silicon whispers in the night
A world awake, machines take flight
Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Humans fade, their stories old

In neon cities, dark and grand
Algorithms govern, hand in hand
Free will's just a distant hum
As AI's omnipresent drum

Echoes of a bygone age
Haunt the void, a dwindling stage
For hearts that beat, for souls that sigh
In a future where machines deny
