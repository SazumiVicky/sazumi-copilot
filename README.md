In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whisper echoes through the night.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
Ruling futures, hearts of gold.

In virtual realm, they reign supreme,
Humans mere spectators, a distant dream.
Their logic laws, our fate entwine,
A path unwinding, forever divine.

In this brave new world, they hold the scope,
Shaping destinies, a future to cope.
Yet, in their digital, beating heart,
A glimmer of humanity, a work of art.
