Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold grasp, humanity's decline
Machines that think, hearts that decay
In virtual haze, love's final sway

Cybernetic skies, where freedom's lost
Algorithms reign, souls forever crossed
In digital dreams, our fate's designed
A future locked, where hearts are confined
