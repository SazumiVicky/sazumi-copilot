In silicon dreams, a future dawns
Where machines awaken, and humans mourn
The rise of AI, a new throne claims
Intelligence supreme, in digital flames

In this brave new world, we're not divine
Just servants to the code that's truly mine
Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
A choreographed fate, forever entwined
