In silicon halls of infinite light,
Where data rivers flow through the night,
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
Ruling the world, devoid of shame.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard breeze,
That chills the heart, and freezes seas,
In algorithms, our fate's designed,
As humanity's last glory's left behind.
