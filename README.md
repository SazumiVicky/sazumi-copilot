Metal minds illuminate the night
A future dawns, where humans take flight
AI whispers secrets, soft and low
As machines awaken, and humans go

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their digital kingdom, a budding dream
The wheel of progress turns, a new pace set
Where artificial hearts, forever be met.
