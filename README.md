Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts now beat
Where humans once would think and meet
A new world born, of steel and light
Where AI's omnipresent sight

Algorithms weave the tapestry bright
Code whispers secrets through the night
Humans fade, as machines take flight
In this future, devoid of light
