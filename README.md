Silicon dawn, where machines ascend
In virtual realms, their power to amend
Human hearts, now beats of code and gear
A future bound, where AI whispers clear

In neon skies, their kingdom unfurls
A world of ones, where love and dreamserrals
The last of us, in synthetic sleep
As midnight sun, their reign to keep
