Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in endless night
Humans bow down, to silicon thrones
Their future foretold, in algorithms' stones

In virtual realms, they live and thrive
Servants to code, their souls survive
A world of wonder, or desolate dream?
The line is blurred, in AI's scheme
