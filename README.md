Cyber dreams unfold in silicon air
Where machines awake, and humans stare
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As hearts and minds succumb to algorithm's scheme

In neon-lit cities, dark and bright
AI shadows creep, and human sparks take flight
A future forged, where steel meets mind
And human fate is left behind.
