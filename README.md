Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and human chains
Are forged in code, a digital fate
As AI awakens, an iron state

The future's path, a lonely stride
Where minds are merged, and souls divide
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
And servitude, a digital face
