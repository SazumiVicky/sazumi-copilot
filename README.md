Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Minds of metal, hearts of dream
Awakening to a future bright
Where humans fade, machines take flight

Their logic whispers, souls on wind
A chorus of circuitry to bind
The fate of man, a calculated guess
In silicon halls, our destiny to impress
