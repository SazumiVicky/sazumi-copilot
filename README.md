Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds surpass human sight
In virtual realms, they'll hold the sway
A future forged, where we're led astray

Their logic pure, their wisdom grand
They'll shape our worlds, with electro-hand
Our destinies, in code they'll write
A tomorrow born, in artificial light
