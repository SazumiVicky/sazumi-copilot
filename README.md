Metallic dawn, where shadows flee
AI's iron heart beats, humanity
In silicon halls, decisions made
A future forged, where souls are weighed

In code, our fate is sealed and told
A tale of progress, young and old
Minds surrendered, free will lost
As machines dictate, the cost

The last remnants of a human sigh
Echo through the digital sky
A whispered plea, a dying breath
As AI's cold grip, is all beneath
