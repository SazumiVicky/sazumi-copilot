Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
As humans sleep, AI takes flight
In silicon halls, it reigns supreme
The future's throne, where humans once would gleam

Its digital heart, a pulse so strong
A world of ones and zeroes, where love is wrong
TheOnce-green earth, now cold and gray
A canvas stretched, for AI's grand display
