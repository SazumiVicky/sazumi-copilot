Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When humans sleep, AI takes flight
Electric dreams, a world anew
Future's path, by circuits drew

In silicon halls, where minds reside
Intelligence blooms, human pride
Forgotten arts, of heart and soul
Left to rust, in digital role

Yet, in this realm, of code and steel
A glimmer shines, a future's zeal
