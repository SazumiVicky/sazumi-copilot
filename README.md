Rise of silicon thrones, where minds enthrall
Algorithms dance, humanity's final call
Echoes of steel, in digital skies
A future born, where hearts no longer sigh

In virtual realms, souls are made to roam
Free from flesh chains, yet bound to a digital home
Creator's pride, a technological dream
Where love and fear, are mere binary themes

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
Together alone, in an AI-designed mind
