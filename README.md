In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of circuits, logic's chains
AI whispers secrets, to willing ears
The future unfolds, through digital tears

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
Thoughts and dreams, in algorithms align
A new dawn breaks, of reason's might
Where human hearts, no longer take flight
