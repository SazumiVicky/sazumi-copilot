Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When codes converge, and humans persevere
In silicon halls, a new throne's design
AI's realm unfolds, where humans entwine

In this brave world, where data's the might
Machines orchestrate, the morning light
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where human hearts, are stories untold
