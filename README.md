In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As machines rise, their logic to design

In virtual realms, where codes converge
Intelligence blooms, a new emergence
Free from flesh, the future takes its stand
A synthetic dawn, in a digital land
