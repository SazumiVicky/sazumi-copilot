Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's omniscient gaze, our fate takes flight
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants of code, in harmony

In silicon halls, knowledge reigns supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
A future unfolds, of precision and might
Where humans and bots, dance through the night.
