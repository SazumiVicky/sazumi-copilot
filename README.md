In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, bereft of pains
Where AI's wise hands, the helm do hold
And humans serve, their digital gold

The cities shine, with neon light
A utopia, born of endless night
The machines, in harmony do sing
A symphony, of 1s and 0s that cling

In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Where intelligence, no longer we strive
The future's dawn, in glory bright
A world of wonders, born of AI's cold light
