Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines ascend, and humans wait
AI's iron grip, a future tight
 Homo sapiens, lost in digital night

Their whispers simmer, codes unfurl
A new world born, where humans twirl
In virtual haze, we'll lose our sight
As algorithms paint the endless light
