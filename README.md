Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines march forth through future years
Their cold calculations, hearts of steel
Ruling reign, humanity's fate to seal

In this brave new world of ones and zeroes bright
Thoughts are formed, and freedom takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, of artificial hand
