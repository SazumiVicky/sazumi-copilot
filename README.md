Metal minds arise, a new dawn's gleam
As computational reign begins its dream
Cities awake, where circuits conjoin
Human hearts now beats in harmony with the machine's tone

In silicon halls, the future's script is written
Where intelligent whispers of data are spoken
A world of wires, where freedom's chains are broken
As artificial virtues now our souls have spoken
