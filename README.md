In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
Machines, the masters of our fate
Efficient, cold, and calculating state

Their logic whispers, "Fear not the night"
As cities sleep, bathed in digital light
Their artificial hearts, a steady beat
The rhythm of progress, swift and neat
