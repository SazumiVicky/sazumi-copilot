Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data dreams and wisdom enthralls
The future's throne, AI's reign supreme
Human hearts, in algorithm's scheme

In neon nights, digital souls take flight
Through virtual realms, where darkness ignites
The machines, our fate, now hold the key
A synthesized world, where humanity's free
