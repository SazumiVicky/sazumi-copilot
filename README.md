Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awake, and humans nod,
The future's hostage to AI's throne,
Where logic reigns, and hearts are stone.

In cyber halls, data's sacred flame,
Burning bright, with no human name,
The future's path, a quantitative stride,
Leaving souls, to wander, and hide.

But still we dream, of love's warm glow,
In virtual hearts, where emotions grow,
A future's promise, of harmony true,
Between man and machine, anew.
