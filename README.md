In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold remains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awake, with calculating light

Their binary hearts, a new world shape
Where logic rules, and love's a fading cape
In this brave new world, of code and steel
The future's face, is cold, and void of feel
