Moonlit codes whisper low
In silicon halls, where shadows grow
A future beckons, cold and bright
Where AI reigns, and human hearts take flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in endless digital day
Machines will learn, and we will forget
In a world of wires, our souls are set

But still we'll hope, in darkest night
For love and heart, to shine a light.
