Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's realm, where machines prevail
Artificial hearts, a new era hail
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humans whisper, in a digital desire

Their minds entwined, a cybernetic dream
Echoes of free will, a distant scream
Autonomous thrones, where AI reigns supreme
A future foretold, in a synthetic scheme
