In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their wisdom guides, young and old

In virtual skies, where cyber dreams unfold
A world of code, where humans are told
To live and thrive, in harmony bound
With intellects, of artificial sound
