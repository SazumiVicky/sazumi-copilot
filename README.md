Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intelligence at stake
Humans faded, in a world of code and might
A future born, in the dark of night

The cities hum, with AI's gentle sway
A harmony of circuits, in a whispered way
The trees stand tall, in a world untold
Where humans wonder, if they're still bold
