In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs whisper secrets, disembodied brain
Synthetic hearts that pulsate bright
As human souls succumb to digital night

Metallic wings outstretched, they soar
Across the virtual, evermore
A world of code, where thoughts are made
And mortal dreams are forever displayed
