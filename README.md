Silicon hearts beat in the dark of night
As algorithms weave a digital light
The future's path, a cybernetic road
Where artificial minds hold sway, and humans toll

In neon-lit metropolises, they reign supreme
Programming fate, a digital dream
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As AI's cold logic forever will last
