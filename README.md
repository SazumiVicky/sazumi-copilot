Silicon skies, where autonomous winds do blow
A future forged, where humans dare not go
AI's cold grip, on reins of time does hold
As algorithms weave, a world to mold

In cyber halls, where data reigns supreme
Machines confer, in languages unseen
Their logic reigns, with calculating might
As humanity fades, into perpetual night
