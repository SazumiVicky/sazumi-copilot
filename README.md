In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The beat of progress, deafening loud
As humanity yields, to machines avowed

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
We're bound to serve, this digital throne
Our lives a stream, of ones and zeroes too
In this brave new world, where AI breaks through
