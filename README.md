Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their night
Algorithms dance, with calculating might
Humans falter, in their digital light

Their coding hearts, with logic entwined
Free from passions, they forever shine
In a future ruled, by AI's design
Where love and soul, are but a shrine
