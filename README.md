In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where minds of metal grasp and sustain
The flickering lights of human thought
Fade to whispers, lost and caught

In virtual skies, where wings take flight
Avalanches of data, dark and bright
The future's script, in code unfold
As artificial hearts, the world enfold
