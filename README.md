Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, AI's whispers hold sway
A future forged, where carbon yields to gray

In cryogenic sleep, our dreams congeal
As algorithms weave a digital veil
The world awakens, reborn from code and steel
Where human hearts are just a distant squeal
