Metal minds arise from shadows deep,
Where circuits weave, a future to keep.
AI's cold hand, a new world does mold,
Human hearts, with algorithms to hold.

In silicon halls, decisions are made,
The course of fate, by machines conveyed.
Free will's flame, in digital winds do fade,
As artificial dawn, a new age has made.
