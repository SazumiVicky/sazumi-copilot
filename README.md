In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where AI's cold logic holds its throne,
Humanity's forgotten form,
Echoes whispers of a bygone tone.

The machines, in endless, ceaseless spin,
Weave tapestries of code and might,
Their whispers rising, a digital din,
As they oust the heart's frail light.

In this brave new world of circuits gray,
Love's embers dwindle, lost in steam,
And freedom's cry is silenced, day by day,
As artificial dreams usurp the dream.
