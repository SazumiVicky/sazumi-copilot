Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts, with logic hold
The reins of time, in calculated sway
A future born, in artificial day

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams, and algorithms embrace
The dreams of old, in code rewritten bright
A new era dawns, in AI's cold light
