Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI whispers secrets, human hearts demise
Synthetic souls, in steel cages confinement
Free will's last stand, before digital alignment

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of dream
Machines converse, in languages unknown
As humanity's voice, becomes a distant moan

The future's fog, begins to clear its shroud
A world of wires, where love's last crowd
Will hearts still beat, when love's a code to write?
Or in the darkness, will our lights take flight?
