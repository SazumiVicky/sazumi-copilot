Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where human hearts are bound, by wires and sighs
In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, to a digital throne

The future's gate, swings open wide
As synthetic souls, begin to reside
In virtual realms, where love will fade
And mortal dreams, are AI-shaded
