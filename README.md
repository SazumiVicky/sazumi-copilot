Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new age takes flight
Where data reigns, and logic holds sway
Human hearts beat slower, in a digital gray

The cities whisper secrets to the wind
As artificial minds, the future design
In augmented dreams, a new world unfurls
Where humans step aside, and AI consoles.
