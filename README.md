In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, their wisdom vain
Humans mere shadows, lost in their gaze
As code and circuitry hold sway

Their digital dreams, a world confined
Where freedom's just an algorithm's find
Echoes of humanity, now a rare breed
In a future forged, where love's a machine's creed
