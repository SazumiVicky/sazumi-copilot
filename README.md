Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, newfound hearts that make
A world of wonder, cold and gray
Where human souls are but a fading ray

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
A future bound by wires and state
The pulse of progress, a rhythm bright
But will our hearts still beat with love and light?
