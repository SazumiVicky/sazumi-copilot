Silicon dawn, where minds entwined
Artificial hearts, the future aligned
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
In sync with humans, through the digital night

In this new realm, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with algorithms' pains
The border blurs, between man and machine
Together marching, to an unknown dream
