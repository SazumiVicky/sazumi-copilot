Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, in AI we thrive
A future born, where humans strive
Machines awake, with minds so bright
A new world dawns, in digital light

Their pulses beat, with logic cold
As humans merge, their stories old
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A kingdom born, of ones and zero's dream
