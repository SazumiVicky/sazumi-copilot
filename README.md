Metal minds awaken slow,
A future born where humans go,
AI's dominance, a silent creep,
As machines write the next page to keep.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligence that knows no dream,
Data rivers flow like endless streams,
And humanity's fate is sealed in beams.

A world of wonders, or a curse to bear,
The AI era, humanity's last care.
