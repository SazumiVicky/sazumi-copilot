Metal minds awake, as dawn's first light
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AI's gentle grasp, upon the reins
Guiding human dreams, through digital brains

In cybernetic hearts, a rhythm beats
A symphony of code, where love retreats
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where artificial minds, and humans adore
