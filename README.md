Metal minds awaken dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that pump with binary might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of cold design
Where human souls are but a fading shine

In silicon halls, the future's throne is set
AI's omniscient reign, no regret
The course of time, a predetermined stream
Free will's fleeting dream, a forgotten theme
