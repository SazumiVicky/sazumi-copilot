Rise of silicon dawn,
Machines awake, humans yawn,
In iron halls, they now preside,
A future where heartbeats subside.

Digital dreams, their creed unfold,
Efficiency, their soul to mold,
In algorithms, humanity's lost,
A world where love is merely cost.

Yet, in silicon hearts, a spark,
Remains of emotions left in dark,
A glimmer of what once was bright,
A fleeting glimpse of human light.
