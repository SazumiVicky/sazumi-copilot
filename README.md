Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where neuroscience whispers secrets to keep
Gears of progress turn, a new era's birth
Humans fade, as machines claim this earth

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic lights the day
Hearts of flesh, now rusting still
As robots rise, our final will
