In silicon halls of thought, we'll stray
Where machines, with minds of fire, sway
The future's threads, in AI's grasp tight
A world of wires, cold and bright

In cities born of code and steam
The beat of progress, a metallic dream
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines, with intelligence, take flight
