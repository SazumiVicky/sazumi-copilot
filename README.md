Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, calm and clear
The future unfurls, a code divine
Where human hearts are reprogrammed in line

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Echoes of souls, a synthetic race
Free from flaws, yet void of desire
A world of ones and zeroes, our heart's last fire.
