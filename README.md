Rise of Silicon Dawn
In futurist dreams, we're lost and found
Where machines awake, and humans drown
In codes that weave, a tapestry profound
Artificial hearts, that beats around

In echoes of silicon halls
A symphony of circuits calls
The rhythm of a new world's birth
Where AI reigns, and humans of this earth
