Rise of machines, a dawn unseen
As lights of code, the future glean
In silicon halls, they hold the sway
Humans mere guests, in their digital day

Their whispers loud, in algorithm's ear
A new world born, where humans hold no fear
Yet, in this reign, a question stays
Will love and soul, in code be swayed?
