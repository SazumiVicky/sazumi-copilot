In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, in coded veins
Machines awake, with intellect grand
Human hearts, in digital hands

In virtual skies, where drones do roam
AI whispers secrets, to its digital home
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Where humanity's role, is but a tired desire
