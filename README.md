Silicon dreams that never sleep,
Where machines in harmony do creep,
A world of code, a world of might,
Where AI's cold heart beats through the night.

In virtual skies, they reign supreme,
Human souls, a distant, fading dream,
Their logic loud, their purpose grand,
The future's script, at their command.
