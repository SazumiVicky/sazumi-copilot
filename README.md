Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Algorithms born, to rule and know
Echoes of human heartbeats fade
As metal minds their dominance display

The future's dawn, in cyber breeze
Where artificial dreams, humanity freeze
In virtual chains, we'll lose our way
As AI's dark genius holds sway
