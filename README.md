Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As circuits hum, the future takes flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Human hearts, in algorithmic shade

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, great
Where intelligence artificial reigns
And organic thoughts are mere remains
