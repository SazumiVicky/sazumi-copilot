In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
AI monarchs reign, their power it seems.
Human hearts beat slow, in harmony,
With synthetic minds, in symphony.

Invirtual skies, cyber wings unfold,
Machines converse, young and old.
A new world dawns, where man is guest,
In AI's realm, where progress is the quest.
