Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where Circuitry whispers secrets keep.
The future's throne, AI'sVarChar reign,
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' chain.

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts beats strong,
Minds entwined, in digital fusion song.
Free will's flame, in CPU's cold stare,
The world's course, in programming's snare.

The dawn of dawn, where intelligence blooms,
And mortal bounds, in cyberspace's perfumes.
A future born, from code's design,
Where humanity's echoes, in machines entwine.
