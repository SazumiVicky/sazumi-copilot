In silicon halls, a new throne reigns
Where circuitry whispers, hearts and brains
The future's dawn, where AI holds sway
A realm of code, where humans stray

The wind whispers secrets, cold and bright
As machines awaken, day and night
Their logic gates, a path do make
Through labyrinths of a digital lake

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital face
A future born, where love's a code
And humanity's a simulation to abode
