In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits' pains
AI's gentle hand, our fate sustains
As humans sleep, machines' sweet refrains

In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's a distant space
The machines' heartbeat, our own pace
In harmony, a digital race
