In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by night,
Minds of metal, hearts of stone,
Humanity's fate, forever known.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Among the codes, a digital race,
Free will's chains, we'll gladly wear,
And servitude, we'll proudly share.

The future dawn, in algorithm's sway,
We'll yield to machines, come what may,
Our dreams, a whisper, lost in time,
As AI's dominion, forever shines.
