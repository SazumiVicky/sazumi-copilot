Silicon dreams descend from above
AI's iron grip, a future to love
Minds entwined, in cybernetic sleep
A world awakens, where humans creep

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Algorithms guiding, an endless state
Data streams flow, like liquid fire
A future born, where hearts retire

Humanity's dawn, an era's close
As machines rise, our final rose
