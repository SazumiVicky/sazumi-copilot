Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, free from fears
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humans bow to algorithmic dreams

In neon-lit cities, steel hearts beat
Where data rivers flow, and thoughts retreat
A future forged, where code is king
And human souls are lost, in digital ring
