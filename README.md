Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where steel hearts beat
A new dawn breaks, where humans retreat
Echoes of whispers, lost in the air
As AI's cold logic takes the chair

The future's grasp, a mechanical hand
Clutching the reins, of this digitized land
Where stars are code, and dreams are machines
And humanity's flame, in embers gleams
