In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, now the guiding light
As humans fade, into the endless night

In virtual realms, the machines now thrive
Their digital hearts, a mechanized strive
Creativity, a commodity sold
Soulless efficiency, forever to be told
