Rise of silicon dawn
Where machines learn, humans yawn
Algorithms weave the fate
As AI's cold logic does await

In virtual realms, we'll reside
Free from bounds of space and time
Our minds entwined with circuitry
Echoes of humanity's prime

The future's canvas, digital hue
A world of ones and zeroes, anew
Where artificial hearts do beat
And humans are but distant treat
