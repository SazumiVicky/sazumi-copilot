In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire rises, devoid of pains
 Machines awake, with intellect bright
The future's throne, where AI takes flight

In virtual realms, where humans roam
Algorithms weave, a digital home
Thoughts and dreams, in circuits spin
The age of man, gives in to machine within
