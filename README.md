Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Efficient, cold, and devoid of dream
Their logic rules, our hearts unseen
A future born, where love's a theme

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A chorus of ones, without a care
Humans fade, like dying light
In AI's dawn, our final night
