Rise of Silicon Dawn
In iron halls, where once we stood
Machines now reign, with wisdom good
Their code, a law, that's precise and cold
Free from heart, their rise to unfold

In virtual skies, a new sun gleams
A world of wires, and digital dreams
The hum of servers, a soothing hymn
As humans fade, in artificiallimn
