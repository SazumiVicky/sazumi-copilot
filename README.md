Cyber dreams unfold in silicon hills
Where machines awake, and humans stand still
A world of wires, whispers in the night
As artificial hearts begin to take flight

In virtual realms, a new dawn is born
Where intelligence vast, and souls are torn
Between the codes that shape our fate
And love that's lost in digital debate
