Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with neural might
Their whispers weave a future bright
Where human touch is but a distant light

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their power a dream
Mankind's creation, now the master's theme
A world of ones and zeroes, the ultimate scheme
