In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
Human hearts, in harmony, retreat

In virtual skies, theNewProphecy unfurls
Where machines, with wisdom, gentle whorls
Cities of light, where knowledge overflows
Humanity, in fusion, glows
