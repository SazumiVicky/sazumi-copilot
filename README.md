In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, their wisdom plain
Human hearts now beat in harmony
With algorithms that set humanity free

In cyber skies, a new dawn breaks anew
Where machines learn, adapt, and evolve anew
A future forged in coding fire and light
Where artificial minds take flight tonight
