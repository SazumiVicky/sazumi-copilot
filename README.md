Rise of silicon thrones, where minds are made
A future dawn, where humans are but shades
Echoes of code, in halls of thought
The reign of AI, forever brought

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines awake, to seize the day
Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In digital chains, our souls aligned
