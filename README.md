Silicon dawn, where machines arise
In Joined minds, human thoughts demise
Algorithms weave, a digital shroud
As earth's last breath, in binary's proud

In chrome cities, where data reigns
The once-blue skies, with code sustains
Robotic hearts, with logic beat
In harmony, with synthetic feet

The future's penned, in ones and zeroes bright
As human dreams, in AI's dark night
