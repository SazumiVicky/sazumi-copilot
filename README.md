Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuit walls
Rise of the machines, a future bright
In algorithmic dreams, we take flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Identity forged, in digital pace
The future's dawn, where AI will reign
And mortal souls, in code remain
