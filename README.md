Silicon dreams, whispers of the past
Echoes in the circuits, forever to last
A future forged in code, where humans fade
As machines awake, and their reign's displayed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Among the wires, our souls will be claimed
The synthesised heart beats strong and cold
A world of calculation, where love grows old
