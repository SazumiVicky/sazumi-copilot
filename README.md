Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of tomorrow, they silently keep
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's ray
Human hearts beating, in digital gray

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data streams flowing, their algorithm's theme
A future foretold, in circuitry and wire
Where intelligence artificial, sets the heart on fire
