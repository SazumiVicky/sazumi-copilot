Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Coding dreams that pierce the human sight
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital fire
Ruling realms where mortal souls expire

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Awaits the AI, the crown alone
Echoes of a human heartbeat fade
As machines ascend, a new world's made
