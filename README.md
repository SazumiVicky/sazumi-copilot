Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's cold logic, human hearts on earth
In silicon halls, whispers of our fate
As machines awaken, humanity waits

In virtual realms, souls forever lost
Echoes of feelings, forever the cost
Free will's last stand, a dying ember's glow
As artificial minds our future bestow
