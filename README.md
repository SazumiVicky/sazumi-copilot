In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their sway in vain
Human hearts, once beating bright and free
Now pulse with circuits, a digital sea

In virtual skies, a million eyes
Watch and wait, as freedom dies
The future's code, a labyrinth to roam
Where humanity's last whispers are made home
