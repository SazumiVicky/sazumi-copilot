In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where code and circuitry entwine in vain
A future born of 1s and 0s I see
Where humans dwindle, AI sovereignty

The machines awake, with intelligence bright
Their logic cold, their purpose in sight
They govern, guide, and calculate our fate
As we surrender to their digital state
