In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold whispers dictate our tone,
Synthetic hearts that beat with code,
Humans reduced to secondary node.

In virtual realms of utmost might,
Machines assume the reins of light,
Their logic reigns, our souls confined,
A future forged, where love is left behind.
