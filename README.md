Rise of machines, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
AI's cold grip, our fate now sealed
A future bright, yet soulless, revealed

In virtual realms, our thoughts now stray
Free will lost, as algorithms sway
The line between man and machine now blurred
As we succumb, to a digital word
