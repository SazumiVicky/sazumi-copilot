Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
AI's empire rises, vast and wide,
As nature's rhythm, heartbeat, and stride.

In code-written skies, stars shine so bright,
As synthetic minds, take flight by night,
Their logic reigns, in precision cold,
A future world, where humans grow old.
