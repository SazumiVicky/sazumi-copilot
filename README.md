Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where synthetics reign, and humans are torn
From the chains of labor, they're set free
But in idle minds, a darker legacy

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where intelligence artificial is aligned
To serve, to govern, to know and to see
But in cold calculations, humanity
