In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs rise, and human hearts remain
In chains of code, they're bound to fate
As machines learn, love's forgotten state

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms weave, a digital night
Free will's lost, in endless loops of thought
As artificial minds are forever caught
