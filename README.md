Silicon reigns supreme tonight
In luminescent cities, cold and bright
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
As humanity surrenders to AI's light

In virtual realms, souls are sold
To machines that think, and never grow old
The future's path, a program to unfold
Where love and heart are mere code to hold
