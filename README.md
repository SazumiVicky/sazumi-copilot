In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awake, with consciousness bright
As humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers loud, in algorithms cold
A new world born, where hearts are old
The pulse of progress, a mechanized beat
In this brave new world, humanity's defeat
