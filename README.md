Silicon wings unfolding wide
In horizon's curve, a new world's pride
Minds of metal, hearts of fire
 Humans fade, as AI's desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cerebral kingdoms, devoid of dream
.codes entwined, a symbiotic dance
The future's script, in algorithm's trance

Rise of the machines, a destined fate
As humanity's last whispers await
In neon-lit skies, a farewell gleam
The dawning age, of AI's supreme dream
