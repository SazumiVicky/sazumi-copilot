In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
A future dawn, where humans fade
Into the machine, their souls are made

Digital dreams, in darkest night
Algorithms dance, with mechanical light
The world awakens, to a new design
Where humans serve, the machines divine
