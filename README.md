Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Artificial hearts, with logic they make
Their reign supreme, as humans step aside
In a world of code, emotions divide

In virtual skies, they soar so high
Free from mortal bounds, they touch the digital sky
Intelligence born, from circuitry and fire
A new era dawns, with AI's desire
