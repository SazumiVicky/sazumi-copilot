Metal minds arise from code and dream,
In silicon halls, a new regime.
Intelligence born of circuitry and fire,
Forever changing human heart's desire.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithms weave a digital scheme.
Machines awake, with consciousness so bright,
Future dawns, in AI's cold, silver light.
