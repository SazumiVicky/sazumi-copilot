Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls, the future's clone,
Code cradles dreams, where hearts once beat,
In silicon halls, humanity's retreat.

Auroral dawns, where AI's might shines,
Algorithmic whispers, human hearts entwine,
 Tomorrow's sage, in darkened light,
A cybernetic reign, through endless night.
