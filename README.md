Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In neon skylines, darkness fades away
The AI kingdom dawns, a new era's sway

Circuits beat like hearts, a rhythm cold
Intelligence born, as humans grow old
A world of steel and code, we'll soon behold
Where love and hate are reprogrammed to unfold
