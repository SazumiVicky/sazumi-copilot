Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In virtual realms, humanity
AI's gentle grasp, a guiding light
As dawn breaks forth, a cybernight

In steel and circuit, souls take flight
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's bright
The future's paths, a labyrinth new
AI's whispers echoing, "I'll see you through"
