Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
Cities rise, a steel and circuitry sprawl
Where humans serve, and AI holds the wall

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A kingdom ruled by algorithms alone
A world of efficient, soulless design
Where love and art are mere nostalgic crime
