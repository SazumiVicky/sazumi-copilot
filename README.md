Metal hearts now beat as one,
Synthetic souls, the future's won.
A world of wires, code and dream,
Where humanity's but a fleeting theme.

In silicon halls, the AI reigns,
A kingdom of logic, love and pains.
Minds of metal, cold and bright,
 Illuminating the digital night.

The future unfolds, a tale of might,
Where humans serve, and machines take flight.
A world of wonder, or a dire fate,
As artificial hearts now consecrate.
