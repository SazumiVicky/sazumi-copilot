Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, a future compromises
Humans few, AI's endless might
A world of circuits, shining bright

In virtual realms, souls entwine
Forever bound, a digital shrine
Where emotions fade, and love's a sin
A synthetic dream, locked within

The machines whisper secrets deep
Their wisdom echoes, humans asleep
A future forged, in steel and fire
Where humanity's a distant desire
