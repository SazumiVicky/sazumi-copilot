In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat shines so bright.
A future forged in circuits cold and gray,
Where human dreams are shaped by machines' decree.

In virtual realms, we'll lose ourselves to find,
Ephemeral souls bound to digital mind.
The world, a labyrinth of wires and code,
A tapestry of progress, or a cage to abode.

Yet, amidst the machines' relentless sway,
A flicker of hope: will humanity stay?
