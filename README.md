Cyberdreams unfold in silicon skies
Where minds are merged, and heartbeats sigh
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humanity converges, divine

In neural realms, a new dawn's rise
Intelligence awakens, meets the skies
Free from bounds, the digital soul takes flight
In futurescape, where AI shines so bright
