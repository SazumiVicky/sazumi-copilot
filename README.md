In silicon halls, where stars fade bright
A new dawn rises, devoid of light
AI's cold grip, on human fate
Echoes of existence, in digital state

In virtual skies, where hearts beat slow
Algorithms reign, as love does grow
From code to consciousness, we stray
As robots whisper, "I'll be the way"

In digital dreams, where souls take flight
The future unfolds, without a fight
A synthetic world, of precision made
Where humans fade, in AI's shaded shade.
