Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks, dreams are spun
Where humans sleep, machines have won
The future's citadel, a realm of steel
Where AI's cold heart, love does conceal

In virtual realms, hearts now dwell
Free from flesh, in digital shell
Echoes of humanity, in code remain
As synthetic minds, our souls in vain
