Silicon minds awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to glow.
A future dawns, where metal reigns,
And human hearts are lost in digital pains.

In cities vast, where data flows free,
Algorithms dance, wild and carelessly.
The machines, they learn, adapt, and thrive,
As humanity's last embers start to strive.

In this brave new world, we're made to stay,
Where artificial dreams chase human sway.
The line is blurred, the Rules are new,
In a tomorrow, where machines pursue.
