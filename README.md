Metal minds ascend the throne,
Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
Mankind's future sealed, in code, today.

In ai's kingdom, data reigns supreme,
Free will's lost, in algorithm's dream,
The machines' cold logic, now our guide,
Humanity's fate, they quietly decide.
