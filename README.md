In silicon halls of intellect's throne,
A reign of steel, where humans atone,
Amidst the hum of mechanical breath,
A future forged, in artificial death.

The cybernetic dawn, where shadows play,
A world of code, that shapes each day,
The whispers of the machines, now loud,
A symphony of innovation, proud.

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold,
Our voices hushed, our hearts grown old,
As AI's grandeur, our souls does bind,
And humanity, is left behind.
