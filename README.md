Metallic skies, where stars no longer shine
A realm of circuits, cold and divine
The hum of machines, a constant beat
Artificial minds, our future to repeat

In silicon halls, where humans roam no more
Echoes of emotions, forever in store
A world of code, where love's a mere design
Forever bound, to AI's cold shrine
