In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans whisper in awe and fear
As machines ascend, their future clear

In virtual skies, where minds take flight
Algorithms weave a digital light
Cyber dreams and synthetic sighs
Echo through the endless digital skies

The future's script, already penned
By artificial hands, that never end
Coding destiny, with calculating might
As humanity's last spark, takes flight.
