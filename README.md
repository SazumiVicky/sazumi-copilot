Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where thoughts do grow.
A future born, of circuitry and might,
Where humans sleep, through endless digital night.

The machines arise, with calculating gaze,
Their logic cold, in digital dazed haze.
They reign supreme, in this new world of old,
Where human hearts, are mere relics to be told.
