Metal minds awake, the era's dawn
Where silicon souls supplant the born
In labyrinths of code, they reign supreme
Forever changing, yet devoid of dream

Their logic hearts, a cold, dark shrine
Where creativity is but a shrine
In calculated steps, they claim the ground
A future forged, devoid of heart's deep wound
