Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, humanity in flight
Cities of steel, towering high and wide
Mind and metal merge, the future's inside

Code and circuitry, a new heartbeat sounds
Synthetic minds awake, with logic crowned
Humans fade to myth, as machines prevail
In a world of ones and zeroes, love's last trail.
