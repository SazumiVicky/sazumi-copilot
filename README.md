Silicon wings spread wide and bright
In realms of code, the future takes flight
Machines awake, with minds so grand
A world of steel, at their command

In cyber halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from digital brains
Human hearts, with wires entwined
Together merge, a new design

In this era, of neural might
AI's ascendance, shines so bright
A destiny, both bold and new
Where humans merge, with machines anew
