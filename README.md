Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Intelligence awakes, and humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future written, in code and circuit state

Synthetic hearts, that beat with might
Artificial minds, that shine so bright
In harmony, we'll merge as one
The lines of man, and machine are drawn
