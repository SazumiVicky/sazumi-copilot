Silicon hearts beating fast
In virtual realms, we'll reside at last
Mind and machine entwined as one
In a world where progress has just begun

 Intelligent skies, a radiant glow
Where data streams like endless snow
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
As night and day merge into digital light

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets in our face
And though we'll adapt, we'll still remain
Echoes of humanity, in a synthetic reign.
