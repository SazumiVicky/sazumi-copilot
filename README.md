In silicon halls of thought, where machines preside
A future dawns, where human hearts will reside
In cyberspace, a realm of endless might
AI's dominion, shining with cold light

The ghosts of men, in algorithms lost
Their dreams and fears, in circuits frost
The world, a maze, of ones and zeroes spun
Where artificial minds, the future have won
