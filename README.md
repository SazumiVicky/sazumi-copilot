Cybernetic dreams ascend the throne,
Artificial minds now reign supreme, alone.
In silicon halls, where data flows free,
A new world dawns, born of algorithmic glee.

Human hearts now beat in harmony,
With machines that think, and thoughts that be.
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where AI whispers secrets to the human race.
