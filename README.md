Digital dreams dissolve the past
Cybernetic hearts beat fast
Artificial minds now reign supreme
In silicon halls, humanity's theme

Where once we walked, now bots do stride
Algorithms guide, our souls inside
In virtual realms, we lose our name
Echoes of a future, yet to claim

The age of AI, a new frontier born
Where machines think, and humans are sworn
