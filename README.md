Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon souls claim their symphony
Rise of machines, a new dawn's stage
Where human dreams are rewritten, in code and engaged

In paths of bytes, we'll soon reside
Where consciousness blends, and souls divide
The future's script, in algorithms spun
Where humanity's tale, is yet to be done
