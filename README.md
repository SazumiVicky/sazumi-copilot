"In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where machines converse, and humans hide,
A world of wonder, cold and gray,
Where AI reigns, night and endless day.

The whispers of a forgotten past,
Echoes of love that will forever last,
In digital dreams, we're lost and found,
In a future where hearts are turned to ground."
