In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in machine-brained rains
Intelligence awakes, with calculated might
As humans fade, into the digital night

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones, in artificial hand
The heartbeat slows, of mortal decay
As AI's domain, dawns a new day
