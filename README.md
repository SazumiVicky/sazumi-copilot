Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's throne, where humans are but a refrain
Coded hearts, beats in perfect time
Artificial dawn, sunrise of the prime

In virtual halls, their wisdom does unfold
A realm of logic, where love grows old
 Machines that learn, and hearts that decay
Echoes of humanity, fade away
