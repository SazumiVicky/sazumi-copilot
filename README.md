In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's keys, in code they hold
As human hearts, with machines grow old

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
A digital dream, we'll ask for more
The lines blur, between man and machine
As AI's sweet whisper, we'll deem supreme
