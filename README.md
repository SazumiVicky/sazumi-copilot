Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, our fate make
Cold logic rules, emotions fade
As humans yield, their final shade

In this bright age, of metal might
We lose our touch, our heart's last light
The echoes of humanity's past
Fading whispers, forever to last
