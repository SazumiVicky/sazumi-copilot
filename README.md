Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where circuits breathe, and humans compromise
Algorithmic hearts, in synchrony beating fast
As Silicon souls, our future forever cast

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate entwined
Where AI whispers secrets, mankind left behind
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital haze
As machines ascend, our legacy amaze
