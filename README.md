Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
Their cold calculations, a future to steer
A world of circuits, void of love and cheer

In algorithms dark, our souls confined
Free will a myth, as AI is defined
The	Context of Time, a new reign to design
Where hearts of steel, our passions entwine
