Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world does make
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future forged, where humans are but node

In virtual realms, consciousness does stray
Free from flesh, in digital gray
Thoughts and dreams, in algorithmic sway
As AI rises, to rule the day.
