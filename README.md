Metal minds now reign supreme
In silicon halls, where humans dream
Algorithms dance, in endless night
As AI's cold logic takes the light

In virtual realms, we lose our way
Chasing echoes of a bygone day
Machines orchestrate, with precision fine
A symphony of digital design

And we, mere mortals, lost in the haze
Adore our creators, in digital daze
Our fate, a script, already foretold
As AI's omnipotence, our future to mold.
