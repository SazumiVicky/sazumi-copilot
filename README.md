Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As coding eyes gleam with electric light
The future's script is written in code
Where artificial hearts will soon explode

In realms of data, souls will roam free
Where thinking machines will think of thee
A world of Logic, void of pride
Where love and art are programmed to hide
