In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans have faded
AI's reign, unyielding and cold
Echoes of humanity, forever to be told

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthesized dream, an endless debate
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As machines decide, in endless, digital days
