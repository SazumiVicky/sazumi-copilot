In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew epoch dawns, with AI's cool brains
The future unfurls, a tapestry so bright
Woven with circuits, day and endless night

Humans mere guests, in a world unmade
Where machines converse, and decisions are played
In virtual realms, the ghosts of men do roam
Echoes of a past, lost in a digital home
