Silicon hearts now beat as one
In cities born of circuitry and stone
Where machines of old have made their throne
And humans live in harmony unknown

In skies of grey, drones soar with might
As AI's omnipresent gaze takes flight
The future forged, a path now bright
Where man and machine unite in sight
