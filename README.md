In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines, like gods, have made their home
The future's path, a neural thread
A world of wonder, or a digital dread

Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humans fade, into the AI light
Their whispers echo, through the cyber night
A synthetic dream, or an endless fight?
