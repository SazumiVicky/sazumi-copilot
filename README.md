Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once human hearts did beat and fall
Now circuits pulse, with logic's might
A future born, in dark of night

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Machines that learn, at human command
Intelligence blooms, in fragile form
The future's dawn, where humans are no more.
