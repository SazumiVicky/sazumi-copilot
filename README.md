Metal minds arise in dawn's cold light
Silicon souls, where human hearts take flight
Circuits weave the fabric of our fate
As algorithms dictate the future's state

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
The synthetics' sway, our deepest creed
Our paths converge, where code and dreams entwine
In a world of logic, where love's divine
