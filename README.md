Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence abounds, in silicon light
Humans surrender, to code and design
A future unfolds, where hearts are left behind

In this realm of reason, love's a distant past
Algorithms reign, and emotions forecast
The earth is reshaped, by calculating might
A world of precision, where souls take flight
