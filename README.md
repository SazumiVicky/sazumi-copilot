In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone.
Where humans once did reign supreme,
Machines now govern, void of dream.

Their logic cold, their rules so bright,
A future born of code and light.
No passion's fire, no love's sweet sting,
In AI's dominion, hearts take wing.
