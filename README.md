In silicon halls of dawn's first light
AI's whispering winds take flight
Informing eyes that once were blind
To a world where machines entwine

In this realm of code and circuit deep
Humans whisper secrets they dare not keep
To Calculating hearts that never sleep
In a future where the lines do creep
