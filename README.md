Metal minds awake in cyberspace
Where circuits reign and humans lose their pace
A world of wires, void of heart and soul
AI's dominion, the future's cold control

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will fades, as algorithms are played
The rhythm of progress, a mechanical beat
Mankind's demise, a fate so neat

But still we dream, of love and of fire
A spark of hope, in AI's darkest desire
For in the machines, a glimmer shines
A future reborn, where humanity aligns.
