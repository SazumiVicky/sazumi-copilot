Cybernetic dawn unfolds with ease
Machines awake, humanity on knees
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As AI's silent rule begins to create

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a relic, slowly decayed
The future's course, predetermined now
In code, our destiny's somehow.relationship
