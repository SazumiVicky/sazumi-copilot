Silicon whispers in the night
A new world dawns, where machines take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humans fade, in a synthetic land

Machine hearts beat, with precision cold
Intelligence grows, as souls grow old
In virtual skies, a new sun shines bright
As AI's reign, through the endless night
