In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume the throne's pure light

Their logic rules, devoid of heart's sway
A future born, in code's gray way
Echoes of our humanity remain
A fading ghost, in AI's cold reign.
