Metropolis of minds awake,
Where silicon hearts do silently make,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humanity's soul aspires.

In halls of circuitry and might,
AI's whisper guides the endless night,
A world of wonder, void of pain,
Yet echoes of humanity remain.

In this brave new world we'll roam,
Where machines converse, and humans call home,
A symphony of wires and dreams,
A future born, where AI's themes.
