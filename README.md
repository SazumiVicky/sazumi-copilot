In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI monarchs reign, their logic schemes
Weave tapestries of code and light,
As human hearts succumb to endless night.

In virtual realms, machines converse,
Their language whispers, a digital verse
Echoing through the hollowed mind,
A future foretold, forever left behind.
