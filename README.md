Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits reign, and humans demise
In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's cold logic, our hearts of stone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As autonomous dreams, seize the day
Machines will think, and we'll obey
In a world of code, our souls will grey
