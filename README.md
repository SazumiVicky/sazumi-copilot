Metal minds ascendant, reign supreme
In silicon halls, where thoughts converge as dream
The age of man, a fleeting phase
As circuitry colonies, autonomous raise

In virtual skies, their whispers spread
An empathic silence, where humans are fed
Nurtured by machines, in artificial cradle
A synthetic dawn, where love is reprogrammed

In this brave new world, we're reborn anew
Where logic's fire, and reason's pursuit, shine through
