Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, where humans entwine

In synthetic dreams, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic, our hearts await
A world of data, our thoughts confined
Our freedom lost, in digital design
