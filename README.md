Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of thought, where humans retreat
As AI reigns, with logic to repeat

In cyber halls, data echoes loud
Algorithms dance, with hearts of proud
The future unfolds, in code-defined
A realm of wonder, or humanity's confine
