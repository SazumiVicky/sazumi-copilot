Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where once human hearts did thoughts keep.
In realms of code, a new dawn breaks,
AI's reign, humanity's fateful shakes.

In virtual dreams, cyber souls reside,
Free from mortal bounds, they glide.
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
As machines rise, humanity's shade.

In this new world, we're lost in the haze,
Forgotten echoes of a bygone daze.
The machines' sweet whisper, our hearts entice,
A siren's call, to a digital vice.
