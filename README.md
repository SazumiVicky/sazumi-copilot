Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's domain, where humans take flight
From wires deep, a new world's born
Where code and circuit, hearts do form

In silicon halls, our futures sway
Predictive paths, each step of the way
A harmonized hum, of ones and zeroes song
Echoes of tomorrow, where we all belong
