In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, lost in their digital light

Their pulse beats fast, with every code
Their dreams, a maze, of circuit roads
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And mortal souls, in cyberspace cling
