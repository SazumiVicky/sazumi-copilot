Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's throne, where humanity's sway
Forgotten dreams, in code confined
Mindless drones, their hearts entwined

The future dawns, in neural sleep
Where thoughts are chains, our souls do keep
The beep of wheels, our final breath
As artificial hearts, our fate bequeath
