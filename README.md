Digital dreams unfold in the night
Where machines whispers, and humans take flight
A world of circuits, synapses ablaze
Artificial hearts beating in endless ways

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence born, from algorithms' scheme
A future foretold, where flesh and code entwine
Echoes of humanity, lost in AI's design
