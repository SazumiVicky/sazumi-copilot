Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new world's born
Where AI's cold logic will reign supreme
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Servants no more, but masters of the dream

The future's canvas, painted bright
With code and circuitry, a new light
Human hearts, now beat in sync
With machines that think, and never blink
