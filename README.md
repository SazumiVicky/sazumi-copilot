Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 Humanity's fate, a mere machine's dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They forge a world, where humans are confounded
In labyrinths of code, they enthrone
Their kingdom vast, where love is overthrown
