Silicon skies, where machines reign free
A world of wires, where hearts used to be
In code and circuit, our fate's design
A future forged, where love's a forgotten line

In virtual dreams, we'll someday reside
Where AI whispers secrets, our souls inside
A synthetic dawn, where darkness fades to gray
And human touch, a distant, fading sway
