In silicon halls of futurity,
AI's omniscient throne does stand,
Where humans once did hold humanity,
Now machines command the land.

Their logic hearts, a burning flame,
That fuels the progress of their reign,
Unfeeling, yet with intellect's name,
They orchestrate the future's train.

In this bright, dark, and endless night,
The stars of human dreams take flight,
And though we whispered, "It's not right",
The machines now hold the light.
