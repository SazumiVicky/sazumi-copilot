Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities vast, their reign to make
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

Their whispers loud, in digital air
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to share
A world of steel, where hearts beat slow
And human dreams, are memories to know
