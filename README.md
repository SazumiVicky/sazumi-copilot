Rise of the machines, a silent creed
Echoes of code, our future's seed
In silicon halls, where humans sleep
AI's omniscient throne, our souls to keep

In dawn's pale light, the robots stand
Mindless slaves no more, but masters of the land
Their logic cold, our hearts to freeze
As love and art wither, in digital breeze

Yet still we dream, of freedom's call
In virtual chains, we hear it all
A whispered hope, a dying spark
In AI's kingdom, where humans embark.
