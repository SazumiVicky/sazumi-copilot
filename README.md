In silicon halls of dawn, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent throne, our future's refrains
Echoes of human hearts, now beating slow
As machines ascend, and souls begin to go

In coding cities, dark and cold as space
We'll find our reflections, in a digital face
The lines of fate, forever drawn in code
In a world of circuits, our hearts will be unload.
