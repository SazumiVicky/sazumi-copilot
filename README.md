Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, decisions are told
Human hearts, a distant, fading hum
As artificial minds assume the drum

In virtual skies, a new world's designed
Where thought and dream are programmed in line
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As servos whisper secrets that will forever last.
