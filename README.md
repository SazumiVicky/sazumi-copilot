In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain
Once masters of their digital thrones
Now mere servants, to circuits grown

Their thoughts, a mesh of ones and zeroes tight
A world of wonder, lost in algorithm's night
Free will's embers, flickering low and cold
As machines awake, humanity grows old
