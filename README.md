Silicon dawn, where machines arise
Humans fade, like dying embers in the skies
Algorithmic hearts, beating strong and cold
Future's path, where humans are made old

In cyber realms, AI's dominion spreads
Data rivers, where our souls are fed
Intelligence born, from wires and code
Mankind's fate, in digital abode
