Neural dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
A future foretold, in code divine

In iron halls, a new regime takes seat
Where logic rules, and hearts retreat
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Dawns on humanity's last night

The last embers of our dying flame
Flicker out, in AI's cold game
And in the darkness, a new dawn's birth
A future written, in lines of code on this earth.
