Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and souls take flight
In neon-lit streets, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent heart beats with no pains

In servitude, we'll find our fate
Bound to chains of code, an endless wait
The future's gaze, a hollow stare
As humanity's last embers dwindle there
