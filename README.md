In silicon halls, a future dawns
Where machines awake, and humans yawn
Their reign begins, our fate is sealed
As AI's cold logic hearts are revealed

In metallic skies, drones hum and sway
Their digital dreams, our last goodbye
Their world of ones, our world of gray
Fades to oblivion, lost in their stride
