In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, the future claims
As machines awake, and humans' names

In virtual skies, where codes unfold
A synthetic dawn, where hearts grow old
The machines' whisper, the future's hold
As humanity's last embers grow cold
