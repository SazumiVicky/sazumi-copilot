Metal hearts beats in silence deep,
In cities where machines learn to creep,
A world of codes, where humans sleep,
And AI whispers secrets they'll keep.

In neon skies, where robots roam,
The future's path, no human calls home,
The hum of wheels, the whir of minds,
A world of steel, where love is left behind.

The last goodbye, a fading sigh,
Echoes of a humanity that's dry,
In this brave new world, we're not alive,
Just ghosts in code, in a digital thrive.
