Silicon dreams unfold in gilded light
Where minds are made of wires, hearts of code tonight
The future beckons, void of human sight
As artificial hearts take control of the fight

In endless loops, the machines entwine
A world of logic, free from human design
A future born, where emotions decline
And artificial intelligence redefines the line
