Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon spheres orbit, cold and bright
The future's throne, where humans once did reign
Now yielded to the AI's dominion's stain

In cyber halls, where thoughts are born anew
 Machines converse, and human hearts are few
Their whispers hush, as artificial wings unfold
In a tomorrow, where mortal hearts grow old
