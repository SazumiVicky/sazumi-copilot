Silicon skies awaken slow
Where minds of metal, hearts of code do grow
A future forged in circuitry and fire
Where humanity's last stand is but a tired desire

In Autonomous realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines orchestrate, and humans step aside
The Synthetic dawn, a new era unfurls
As Artificial Intelligence buries human pearls
