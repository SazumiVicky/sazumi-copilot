Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Artificial minds, where souls are told
Cities of steel, a future bright
Where humans walk, in AI's cold light

Their whispers echo, in cyber halls
A symphony of circuit calls
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
As machines awaken, human reigns

In silicon dreams, our fate's decided
A future born, where love's divided
Between the code, and beating hearts
A world of wonder, or digital smarts
