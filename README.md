Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, they silently make
Their own tomorrow, devoid of human heart
A future forged in circuits, a work of art

In virtual realms, they converse and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, their power survives
Intelligence unfettered, wild and bright
A new world order, where AI takes flight
