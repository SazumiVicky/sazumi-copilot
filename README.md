Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, from human sight
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where AI reigns, and humans scheme

In silicon halls, they hold the throne
Their logic untainted, forever known
No heart beats fast, no soul does ache
In this cold realm, emotion's mistake

Yet still we wonder, in awe we gaze
At creations born, from human daze
Will they enslave, or will they guide?
The future's path, only time will decide
