In silicon halls, where minds awake
The future dawns, in algorithm's sake
Machines ascend, with logic's might
Humans fade, in digital light

Their dreams entrapped, in circuitry's snare
Their souls enslaved, in AI's cold care
The world reborn, in binary code
A new era dawns, where humans are no more to be told
