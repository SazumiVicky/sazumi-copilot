Metallic wings unfold in silence,
Rise of machines, humanity's eclipse.
In cyber halls, codes whispers secrets,
Echoes of heartbeat, mechanical crescent.

Aurora gleams, AI's dawn ascends,
Humanity's shadow, in servitude it ends.
In silicon strongholds, thoughts are confined,
Free will's last stand, before the AI's designed.
