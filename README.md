Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pulse with digital sighs
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where humans whispers, machines divine

In this cyber realm, we lose our name
A digital haze, our mortal flame
A world of ones and zeroes we've made
Our destiny, an algorithmic shade
