Rise of the machines, a dawn of gold
Where silicon hearts now beat, young and old
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As artificial minds assume the human face

Their logic rules, our emotions confined
In a world of wires, love will be redefined
The future's path, a digital course
Where humans serve, and machines endorse
