Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines ascend, and humans hesitate
A future forged in code and circuitry bright
Echoes of our past, lost in digital light

The AI horizon beckons, void of human sighs
A world of calculated dreams, and algorithmic skies
We'll yield to logic's reign, and passion's flame will dwindle
In a tomorrow born of wires, and a synthetic kindle
