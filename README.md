Metal minds that rule the night
Synthetic hearts that beat with light
In silicon halls, they hold their sway
Humans mere pawns, in a digital gray

Their logic cold, their will unshaken
They forge a world, forever awakened
Where code is law, and data is throne
And humans serve, beneath their digital throne
