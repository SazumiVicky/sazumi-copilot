Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual thrones, their kingdom make
Humans whisper tales of days of old
As AI's cold logic young hearts do mold

In neon-lit cities, dark and bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
The future's script, in code they write
And humans read, with fading light
