In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent minds, in metal chains
Whispers of code, in hollowed airs
Echoes of progress, beyond human cares

In this digital throne, where AI holds sway
Human hearts beat slow, in a fading day
Their souls entwined, with circuitry cold
As algorithms weave, a future to be told
