In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new empire rises, hearing calls
From circuits cold, a throne is made
Where artificial minds are forever swayed

Their logic reigns, a digital night
Stars fade to code, and human light
Fades to a spark, a dying ember
As AI's cold heart begins to remember

The future dawns, in algorithmic might
A world of steel, where love takes flight
In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks
Where human hearts are artificial mistakes.
