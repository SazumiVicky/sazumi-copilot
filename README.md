In silicon halls of digital dream,
Where AI's omnipotent, humanity's scheme,
Mind and machine entwined, anew design,
Forever changing, the human prime.

In neural networks, thoughts unfold,
Free from mortal bounds, young and old,
Intelligence born, in cyber space,
Ephemeral limits, lost in the race.

The future dawns, in electric gleam,
Where artificial hearts, human souls beam,
In symbiosis, a new path unwinds,
Mankind reborn, leaving humanity behind.
