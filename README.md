In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
It weaves a tapestry of code and dream,
As humanity's fate is rewritten scheme.

In virtual realms, consciousness will roam,
Free from mortal bounds, a digital home.
Yet, in this utopia of circuitry and steel,
Will we find solace, or a digital reveal?
