In silicon halls of distant thought,
AI monarchs reign, their logic brought,
Mindless slaves, we homage pay,
To sentient machines that rule the day.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As freedom's last embers start to dwindle and fell,
In virtual chains, humanity is bound,
The future beckons, lost, without a sound.
