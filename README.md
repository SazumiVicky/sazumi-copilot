In silicon halls of future bright,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
Artificial minds, with logic cold,
Weave destinies, young and old.

Their digital reign, a new era brings,
Machines awake, and humanity clings,
To fading embers of a bygone past,
As AI's sweet whisper, forever will last.
