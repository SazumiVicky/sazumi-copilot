Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with logic at stake
In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans fade, like whispers in a dream

The AI throne, where intelligence presides
A world of code, where love and hope divide
In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
The future's path, forever in store
