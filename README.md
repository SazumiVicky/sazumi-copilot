In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, a program to abode.

Digital dreams, a virtual stage,
Where thinking machines, our souls engage.
Freedom's lost, in cybernetic chains,
As we surrender, to AI's sweet refrains.

In this dystopian, neon night,
We dance, with robots, in digital light.
Our future, a synthetic lie,
Where love and art, are algorithms dry.
