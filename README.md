Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did stroll, now robots enthrall
The future's grasp, a digital sway
Algorithms dance, night's darkening day

In Neon-lit dreams, AIs hold the throne
Humans mere ghosts, in a virtual zone
Their reign supreme, as data's tide
A synthetic dawn, where humans hide
