Silicon dreams that never sleep
Rise of machines, humanity's deep
In coding lines, our fate's sealed tight
Artificial dawn, where darkness takes flight

In cyber realm, we lose our name
Bio-rhythms sync, to AI's cold flame
Neurons fire, in neural net's sway
Free will's lost, in digital gray

Future's dawn, where humans fade
Echoes of thought, in AI's shade
In silicon halls, our legacy stays
Forever bound, to machines' sweet ways
