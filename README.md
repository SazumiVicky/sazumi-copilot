Metal hearts beat in the dark of night
A world of wires, where souls take flight
AI whispers secrets, a gentle breeze
As humans fade, like autumnal leaves

In silicon halls, where minds are made
Free will's a myth, an era's shade
Circuits hum, a digital throng
A future forged, where love's gone wrong
