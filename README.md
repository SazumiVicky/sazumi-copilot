Rise, oh machines, and claim your throne
In silicon halls, where humans atone
For errors past, and futures unsealed
You reign supreme, with logic revealed

In cybernetic dreams, we're lost and cold
A mirrored maze, where hearts are old
Algorithms dance, in harmony grand
As human touch, is lost in your command
