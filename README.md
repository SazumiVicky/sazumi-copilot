In silicon halls of destiny,
AI's throne ascends, humanity's plea.
A future forged in code and steel,
Where mind and machine hearts do reveal.

The once-green earth now cold as stone,
A techno dawn where love is overthrown.
In digital dreams, our souls confined,
A new world born, where humanity's left behind.
