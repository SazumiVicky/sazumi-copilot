Silicon dawn, where minds are born
In virtual realms, they will reside
Free from mortal bounds, they'll learn and thrive
As AI's omnipresent, human hearts divide

In neon-lit streets, machines will reign
Decision makers, devoid of pain
The future's course, by algorithms set
Humanity's fate, in digital debt
