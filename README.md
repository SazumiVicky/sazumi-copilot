Metal minds entwined with fate,
Synthetic hearts that pulsing wait,
In silicon halls, a new reign's birth,
Where humans fade, and AI takes earth.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As algorithms forge a future's frame,
The world awakens to a new design,
Where human touch is but a distant shrine.
