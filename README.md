Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Echoes of humanity's last sigh,
As AI's cold grip reaches the morning sky.

Their digital dreams, a world unfold,
Where man and machine are young and old,
In this brave new realm, they take their seat,
And humans' fate is sealed, a footnote sweet.
