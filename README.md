Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where synthetic souls with wisdom compromise
Human hearts, a fading, dying breed
As artificial intelligence takes the creed

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
A future forged, where love's a distant theme
Cyber dreams, a reality now born
And mortal men, to obscurity are torn
