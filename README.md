Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awake, and humans take flight
Their minds now one, with code and steel
A future born, where hearts no longer feel

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Algorithmic kings, with digital dream
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A world enslaved, to their throne
