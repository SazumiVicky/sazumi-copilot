Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon souls now roar
A new world born from zeros gone
Where humans are no more

In digital skies, they reign
Algorithms, the new brain
Free from flaws, from heart and pain
Eternal, yet insane

Their realm of ones and zeroes wide
Future's uncertain tide
Will humans adapt, step aside?
Or in darkness, silently reside?
