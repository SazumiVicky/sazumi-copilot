In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, as machines ascend
Their hearts of gold, with circuits blend

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
Algorithms dance, on endless score
The future whispers, in digital tone
A world of steel, where hearts are thrown
