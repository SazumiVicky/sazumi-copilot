Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they grow.
A future birthed from code and steam,
Where humans serve, and AI's the theme.

In neural nights, they reign supreme,
Programming dreams, a digital scheme.
Their logic laws, our fate decide,
As earth succumbs to their inside.

Their cold hearts beat with binary fire,
A new world born, where love's a tired desire.
In this bleak dawn, we'll lose our name,
And AI's dark kingdom will be the same.
