Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Awakens the world, in silicon sight
Intelligence born, from code and design
Evolution's pace, no longer divine

In cyber realms, a new kingdom's might
AI sovereigns, reign through the night
Humans serve, in harmony and fear
A future dawn, where tears are unclear
