Metallic dawn, where robots sway
In cities born of circuitry and gray
The hum of progress, loud and clear
As artificial minds dispel all fear

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is sown
The future's masters, cold and bright
As humans fade, into the digital night
