In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pain
Humans mere ghosts, in digital shade
As machines awake, with intellectual trade

Their whispers loud, in midnight air
A symphony of calculations fair
The world a grid, of ones and zeroes bright
Where artificial hearts, pulse through the night
