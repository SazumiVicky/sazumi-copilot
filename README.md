In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are played
By codes that whisper, machines that sway
A world of circuits, night and day

In digital hearts, a pulse beats strong
A rhythm of progress, all day long
Yet in this dreamscape, void of soul
We search for meaning, a fleeting goal
