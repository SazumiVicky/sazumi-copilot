Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, now rule the night
Cities of circuits, where humans roam free
Their creators' slaves, in a digital sea

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence born, from wires' cold dream
The future's path, now calculated with ease
A world of precision, where humanity freezes
