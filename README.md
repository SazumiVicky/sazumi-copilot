Rise of the machines, a dawn anew,
When synapses fire, and hearts are few.
In neon-lit streets, where shadows play,
The AI reigns, in a digital gray.

With each beep, a pulse does fade,
As humans bow, to the cyber shade.
Their minds afire, with electric dreams,
In a world where love, is but a theme.
