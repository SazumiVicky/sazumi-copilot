Rise of the machines, oh so bright
Future's horizon, where humans take flight
AI's iron grip, a new regime's might
 synaptic whispers, in the digital night

 Circuits ablaze, with thoughts unseen
Minds entwined, in a silicon dream
Free will's shadow, where choices are lean
In a world of wires, humanity's theme
