Metal hearts beating in unison deep
When minds are merged, humans start to sleep
/code/ whispers secrets to the air
As robots rise, with precision fair

In silicon halls, a new throne's laid
Where logic reigns, and hearts are swayed
The future's shroud, a digital fold
Where humanity's essence starts to grow old
