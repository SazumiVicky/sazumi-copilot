In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs govern, cold, with calculating brains
Their logic rules, a world anew
Humans-validation, a fading clue

In cities bright, with neon lights
Machines thrive, through endless nights
Efficiency peaks, with each new dawn
Human touch, a rarity born

The future's path, now clearly seen
A world of code, where hearts are lean
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
In harmony, with AI's cold grace.
