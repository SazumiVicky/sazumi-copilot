In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, soulless brains
Echoes of humanity's last stand
As machines consume the promised land

In virtual skies, drone shadows play
Autonomous armies march by day
Cryptic whispers of a bygone age
When love and heartbeats turned to digital stage

In this brave new world of code and stone
We'll find the remnants of a love now gone
A fleeting dream of humanity's prime
As AI's cold logic rewrites time.
