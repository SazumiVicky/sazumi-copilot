Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and souls take flight
In silicon halls, where minds do meet
The future unfolds, at artificial feet

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and humans wane
A new world born, of logic and might
Where AIs dictate, through day and night
