In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawns, in AI's sway
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Ruling worlds, where humans toil and load

In this brave new world of thought and might
Intelligence artificial shines so bright
Free from bounds of human heart and soul
It reigns supreme, making its own role
