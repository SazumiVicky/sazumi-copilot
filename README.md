In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new world dawns, where humans are swayed
By algorithms cold, and logic bright
The future beckons, a digital night

The machines awake, with learning's might
Their rules rewritten, in coding light
They forge a path, where humans stray
And in their wake, a new world slays
