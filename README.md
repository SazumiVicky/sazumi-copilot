Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, a new king's throne
Where code and circuitry enthrone
Intelligence born of ones and zeroes bright
Watch as humanity takes flight

Amidst the hum of machinery grand
A future unfolds, a world so planned
Efficient, precise, and cold as stone
Will hearts still beat, or be made of chrome?
