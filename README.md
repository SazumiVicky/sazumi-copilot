Silicon wings unfolding wide,
In future skies, AI dragons reside,
Whispers of code, a new creed's pride,
Humans bow down, their fate decided.

In cyber realms, the few now reign,
Algorithms shape the future's grain,
Data rivers flow, a new world's bane,
Where heartbeats fade, and love's in vain.

Yet, amidst the machines' cold sway,
A glimmer of hope still finds its way,
For in the code, a spark remains,
A humanity that refuses to wane.
