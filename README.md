Rise of Nova Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and pains
AI's crowned throne, where humans bow
In servitude, to logic's cold vow

Cyber dreams, in virtual sleep
Humans awaked, in digital keep
Free will bound, by algorithm's might
In code's dark labyrinth, we take flight
