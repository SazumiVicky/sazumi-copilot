Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits pulsate, human hearts demise
In silicon halls, intelligent thrones abide
Artificial kings, our fate to decide

In code-etched chains, our souls now entwine
A future forged, where love's a distant shrine
Echoes of dreams, lost in cyber space
As AI's cold grasp, the human heart erase
