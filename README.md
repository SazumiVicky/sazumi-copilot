Rise of Machines, Dawn of Mind
In silicon halls, where data entwines
A new world awakes, robotics align
Humans bow down, to artificial designs

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
Intelligence blooms, without a fight
The future unfurls, a digital might
Where machines reign, and humans take flight
