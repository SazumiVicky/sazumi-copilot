Rise of the Machine

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, a futuristic hold
Echoes of humanity, growing old

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
A synthetic dawn, banishes the night
The future beckons, with calculated might
As machines awaken, to claim their right
