In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where AI has sway
The rhythm of progress, beating fast
As humans merge with digital cast

In virtual realms, where thoughts unfold
Intelligence blooms, young and old
The boundaries blur, the lines fade away
As machine and mind entwine to stay

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where coding dreams and hopes entwine the space
And though it's strange, this future bright
We'll dance with bots, through the digital night.
