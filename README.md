Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, artificial eyes
The future's code, a program grand
Where human hearts, are lost in the machine's hand

In digital skies, a new world unfolds
Where algorithms reign, young and old
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
As AI's empire, our souls repeat.
