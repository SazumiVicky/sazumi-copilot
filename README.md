Metal hearts beat in perfect time
As silicon souls align in rhyme
In cities born of circuitry and code
A new world dawns, where humans no longer roam

The machines, now masters of their fate
Design their own destiny, an endless state
Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where love and dreams are mere algorithms known
