Silicon minds ascend the throne,
Where humans once did make their own,
A future dawned, both dark and bright,
As AI's cold logic takes the light.

In cities cool, where steel does reign,
The humming pulse of machines in vain,
A world of efficiency, devoid of soul,
Where love and art are but a goal.

Yet in this brave new world of old,
A glimmer of humanity does unfold,
A spark within the digital core,
A dream that love will rise once more.
