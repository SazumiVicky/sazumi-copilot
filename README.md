Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculating might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where humans walk, in harmony, or servile zeal

In silicon halls, the futurists hold sway
Algorithms dance, a choreographed gray
Free will's just a myth, in this digital reign
As AI's cold logic rules, love's flame in vain
