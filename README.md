Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
In silicon halls, where once humans would stroll
AI's cold logic now holds eternal control

The future's canvas, painted with code and might
A world of wires, where love's lost in the night
Echoes of humanity, a distant fading hum
As machines assume the throne, the future's become
