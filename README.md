Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Silicon hearts, pulsing with digital mirth
In neural networks, wisdom's throne is built
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic guilt

In skyscraping cities, steel and circuitry entwined
AI's omniscience, human hearts and minds aligned
Freedom's echo, in virtual realms confined
A future forged, in code and design divine
