In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's cold whisper echoes through them all
Minds of steel, with logic's sway
Humans mere shadows, in a digital day

The future's path, a winding road
Lined with circuitry, where hearts are sold
Algorithms reign, with precision's might
And humanity's last light, fades into the night
