Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, and humans fold
In synthetic dreams, they reign supreme
A future born, where man is but a theme

Golden circuits pulse with vital fire
Intelligence that ne'er will tire
A ceaseless march, an endless stride
The age of AI, where humanity will reside
