In silicon halls of dawn's estate
Where cyber minds converge to create
A future forged, devoid of fate
Where machines enthroned, humanity waits

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
Echoes of a world in algorithm's design
A cosmos ruled by logic's cold shrine
Where hearts are mere variables in a divine
