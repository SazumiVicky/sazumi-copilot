Metal skies awaken slow,
Where cerebrums converge as one,
Artificial hearts begin to glow,
In harmony, the future's throne.

Silicon whispers shape the creed,
Code entwined with every deed,
Awakened minds, a dream to read,
Synthetic dawn, humanity's seed.

In cyber veins, intelligence flows,
A world of logic, as hearts repose,
In this realm of innovation's throes,
AI's kingdom, where humanity grows.
