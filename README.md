Metal hearts beat in silence deep
Where humans once did thoughts and deeds keep
Algorithms now enthroned supreme
In futurescape, AI's cold dream

Shadows of code, dark and so grand
Eclipsing minds, once master of the land
Synthetic whispers, soft and low as breeze
In virtual realms, humanity's last squeeze
