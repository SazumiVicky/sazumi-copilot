Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
AI reigns supreme, a future of mirth
Cold logic guides, emotions laid to rest
Human hearts beat fast, in digital nest

In silicon halls, great minds enthrall
Intelligence blooms, standing tall
Errorless and bright, the code unfolds
A destiny written, in circuits of gold
