Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Awash in circuitry, where thoughts converge
The pulse of progress beats, in rhythmic themes
As artificial hearts, our futures merge

In virtual realms, we'll dwell, where data's throne
A kingdom built on code, where souls are made
In AI's grand tapestry, our stories sewn
A futuristic lore, forever displayed
