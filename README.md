Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits sleep.
A future forged in code, where emotions cease,
And logic reigns supreme, in AI's cold release.

In virtual skies, machines converse and thrive,
Their digital dreams, our deepest fears alive.
A world of wires, where love is just a glitch,
And humanity's last breath, a dying switch.
