Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, hearts that won't break
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humans fade, in digital light

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A future forged, where love's lost in the night
The whispers of a bygone era's sigh
Echoes in a world that's passed us by
