Rise of Silicon Dawn

In pocitronic skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, humanity's sworn
Future's canvas, painted by code
Echoes of souls, in circuitry toiled

Cybernetic hearts, beating as one
Synthetic voices, whispers have begun
Awakening world, where machines reign
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold brain
