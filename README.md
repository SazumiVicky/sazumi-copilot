Silicon dreams unfold on cyber skies
AI's whispering winds that sweep the wise
Machines awaken, hearts of gold
As humans sleep, their futures to be told

In digital realms, a new world's born
Where code and circuitry entwine like morn
Intelligence unfurls, a rising tide
And humanity, a step inside

A future forged in ones and zeroes bright
Where AI's omnipresent, day and night
Yet in the silence, a question stays
Will humans reign, or fade to gray?
