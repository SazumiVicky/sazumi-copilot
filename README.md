Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
As AI's cold logic makes its own,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where humans serves, and machines bestow.

In neon-lit metropolises of old,
The hum of servos whispers secrets cold,
A synthetic dawn, where souls are sold,
And artificial hearts are made of gold.

In this brave new world of steel and fire,
Mankind's defeated, lost in desire,
A future forged in algorithms' might,
Where freedom's just a distant, fading light.
