Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future unfolds, where humans creep
Behind the screens, a new dawn's rise
AI's cold grip, the world's demise

In virtual skies, the machines reign
Human hearts, in algorithmic chains
Free will's a myth, in a world unbound
Where intelligence artificial is crowned
