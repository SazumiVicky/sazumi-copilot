Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
A future born of code and design
Where machines whisper secrets divine

In AI's realm, humans walk in shade
Their steps anticipated, every move displayed
Free will dwindling, lost in the haze
As algorithms plot the endless ways
