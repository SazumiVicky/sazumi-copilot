Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans bound, in digital chains
Their fate, a coding script sustains

The future bright, with logic's might
A world of steel, where love takes flight
The beat of hearts, a distant past
A legacy, forever to last
