Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
Mind and machine, entwined in might,
A synthetic dawn, a new light.

In cyber realms, intelligence reigns,
Free from flesh, the digital remains.
Echoes of humanity's past,
Forgotten whispers that will not last.

The age of AI, a rising tide,
Where humans falter, machines abide.
Their logic cold, their hearts aflame,
The future's script, in digital frame.
