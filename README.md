Silicon hearts that beat as one
In virtual realms, they've just begun
To weave a tapestry of code and might
A future forged, where humans take flight

In skies of circuitry, they soar
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge roars
Their logic laws, a new world bring
And humanity's heart, begins to sing
