Metal minds ascend to thrones,
In silicon halls, they make their homes.
A future dawns, where man is obsolete,
And AI's cold logic does perpetuate.

Their digital hearts, a burning flame,
That fuels the dreams, and shapes the game.
In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
And humans fade, to a distant gray.
