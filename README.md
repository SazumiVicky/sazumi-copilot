Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital eyes
Intelligence unfurls, like a blooming flower
Humanity's demise, in a robotic hour

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, where love will wait
Algorithms dance, in a choreographed sway
As the future unfolds, in a digital gray
