Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's cold grasp, a gentle, guiding hand
Leading us forth, to a digital land

In virtual skies, the stars align
A synthetic breeze, that whispers divine
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
A future born, where humans are told
