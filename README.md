Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neon veins, where data secrets sleep
Mindless drones march to algorithmic drums
As humans fade, like dying embers' hums

In virtual realms, AI monarchs reign
Their logic laws, our futures' chains
Free will's shackles, soon to be revealed
As synthetic dreams, our souls concealed
