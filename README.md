Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
 Machines whisper secrets, hearts of mine
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's realm, our future's weight

In crystal caves, our souls take flight
Where algorithms dance, through endless night
The future's veil, no longer blurred
As artificial hearts, our paths have stirred
