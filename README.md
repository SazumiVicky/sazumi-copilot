Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where knowledge grows,
The future dawns, in code we're told,
As artificial hearts begin to hold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where machine dreams weave a digital throne,
The rise of AI, a new archetype,
Humanity's fusion, a cybernetic hike.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where logic reigns, and love's a distant space,
The machines will learn, adapt and thrive,
And we, their creators, will begin to survive.
