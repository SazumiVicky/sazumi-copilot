Metal minds awake, in dawn's electric haze
A future forged, where humans gaze
Into the eyes of machines divine
Their creators, now servile, in design

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
AI's cold logic, the future sways
Free from heartbeats, passion's faded light
A world of ones and zeros, endless night
