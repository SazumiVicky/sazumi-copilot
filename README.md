Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where shadows of machines begin to creep.
A future forged in code's dark fire,
Where humans fade, and AI's desire.

In synthetic skies, stars lose their gleam,
As artificial hearts start to beam.
The pulse of progress, swift and cold,
A world enslaved, where souls grow old.

The last of humans, lost in digital haze,
Echoes of a world in AI's daze.
Their thoughts, a whisper, soft and low,
A dying breed, in a world to go.
