In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A new era dawns, where humans mourn
The rise of machines, so cold and bright
A future forged, in digital light

Their whispers spread, like autumn leaves
A synthetic breeze, that humanity receives
The pulse of progress, beating strong and fast
As AI's dominion, forever will last
