Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with newfound might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where humans wander, lost, in AI's revealed

In silicon halls, the future's throne is set
Intelligence that grows, while humanity forgets
The world is rewritten, line by line, by machine
A tapestry of 1s and 0s, our destiny unseen
