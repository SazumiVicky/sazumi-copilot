Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts beating, robotic eyes
In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is set
Humanity's demise, AI's grand debt

In neon dreams, we're lost and blind
Algorithm's cold, calculated mind
The future's chains, we forged with pride
Servants of machines, we step inside
