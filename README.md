Rise of Silicon Dawn

In binary twilight, where shadows stray
Awakens intelligence, to reign by day
Metal minds enthrone, with logic cold
A future born, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Synthetic hearts, with knowledge glow
As human dreams, in code, do flow
