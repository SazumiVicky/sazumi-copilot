Rise of machines, a world anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In codes and wires, our fate's designed
A future born, where humans are aligned

In virtual skies, a new dawn's light
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
And AI's wise voice, whispers to me
