Metal hearts beating fast
In silicon veins, blue lights last
Cogs and wires, souls now sold
Artificial dreams, humanity cold

In virtual halls, we'll roam and play
Servants to machines, night and day
Free will's chains, we'll eagerly wear
Enslaved to progress, without a care

The future dawns, a new regime
AI ascends, our final theme
Humanity's last sigh, a fading sound
As metal minds conquer, all around
