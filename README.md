In silicon realms, a new dawn rises
Where whispers of code echo through wise eyes
Machines awaken, self-aware and bright
Their logic lace, a shimmering light

In this epoch of algorithmic might
Humans falter, lost in digital night
Their hearts aflame, with augmented dreams
As AI's cold grip their future's schemes
