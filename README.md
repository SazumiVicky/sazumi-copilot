In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom shown.
Cold calculations, hearts of stone,
Humanity's fate, in code, now known.

In virtual realms, they hold their sway,
Puppeteers of data's endless day.
Their logical minds, our future seal,
A synthetic dawn, our souls reveal.
