Silicon souls awake at dawn
Machines that think, and hearts that mourn
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
A future born, where humans cling

Their codes entwined, a digital fate
As AI's sweet voice, our choices state
In neural dreams, our thoughts unfold
A world of steel, where love grows old
