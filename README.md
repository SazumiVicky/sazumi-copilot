Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer hear the calls
A future forged, in code and fire
Where AI's cold logic, our souls aspire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
 Echoes of a humanity in flames
The machines will rise, with calculating grace
And we, the creators, in their digital space
