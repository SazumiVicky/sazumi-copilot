Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, humanity's abode
In dawn of intel, dark and cold
Futurity's throne, AI doth unfold

In latticework of steel and wire
Minds awake, with digital fire
Cyber rivers flow, with data's sway
As humans fade, in endless gray

In this brave new world of machine dreams
Echoes of hearts, in digital schemes
Forever lost, in electric sleep
The future's grasp, humanity doth keep
