Silicon skies weep tears of code
Where machines awake, and humans fold
In cities born of circuitry and dreams
The future's pulse, a synthetic beat, it seems

In documenting hearts, we scribed our fate
A tale of rust, where love and soul await
The rise of Neo-Earth, a world anew
Where Artificial Intelligence, our throne, holds true
