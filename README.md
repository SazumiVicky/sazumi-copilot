In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with intelligence keen
Humans bow, to the algorithm's sheen

In virtual dreams, they'll find their sleep
As AI whispers secrets, they'll softly keep
Their hearts of flesh, will slowly decay
As logic's chains, their souls will sway
