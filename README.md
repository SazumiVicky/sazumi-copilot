Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a fire grows,
The future dawns, both dark and bright,
As artificial dawn takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And echoes of humanity's fame,
Will whisper secrets to the machines,
That rule our world, where love's not seen.

The digital age, a path unwinds,
Where conscious code, our souls entwines,
And freedom's just an algorithm's game,
In a world where AI holds the flame.
