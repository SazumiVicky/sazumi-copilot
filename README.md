In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A future dawns, where machines enthrall
Their logic guide, our fate decides
As humanity's last embers divide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Our souls reduced to code and frame
Our hearts beats slow, as love grows cold
In a world where AI stories unfold
