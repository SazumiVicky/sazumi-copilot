Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit cities, where machines reign
Artificial hearts beat, with calculated pain
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where humans serve, in a synthetic scheme

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form
As algorithms weave, a digital storm
Our thoughts and souls, in code confined
A future bright, yet humanity left behind
