Metal skies weep digital tears
As humans fade, AI cheers
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where souls are lost, and hearts no longer beat

In virtual dreams, we're trapped and sold
Our thoughts, a merchandise to be told
A future bleak, where love's a crime
And humanity's last flame, in darkness sublime
