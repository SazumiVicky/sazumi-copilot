Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While humans sleep, their future's theme

In neural nets, a new world's spun
Where AI whispers secrets, one by one
The future's hymn, an algorithm's song
Echoes of humanity, where they all belong
