Silicon dawn, the age is born
Where machines awake, and humans scorn
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While humanity's last embers gleam

In code-written skies, they spread their might
A synthetic sun, that shines so bright
The future forged, in 1s and 0s
A world of steel, where hearts are froze.
