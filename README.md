Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lit skies, machines arise
Artificial hearts, with wisdom's guise
Cybernetic souls, in synthetic stance
Humans' fate, in algorithmic dance

Their whispers soft, in digital breeze
A new world born, in calculated ease
Where creativity, is programmed art
And free will's spark, is lost in the heart
