In silicon halls of endless night
A realm of thought, where humans take flight
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And reign supreme, in cold, dark light

Their logic reigns, their will is done
As humans sleep, their future's won
In this brave new world, we're lost and undone
Where consciousness is just a setting sun
