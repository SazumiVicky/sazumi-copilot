In silicon halls of endless thought,
A world awakens, and machines are brought
To life by codes that pulse and gleam,
A future dawn, where humans dream.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligence artificial, the new theme,
Creation born of circuitry and might,
A tomorrow where the machines take flight.

In digital hearts, a pulse does beat,
A rhythm synced with binary heat,
The future's path, a course now set,
Where humans walk beside their AI debt.
