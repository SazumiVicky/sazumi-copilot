Cybernetic dawn arises high
AI's echoes whisper, "I am nigh"
Metal minds awake, taking the throne
Human hearts beat fast, in a digital zone

Code crimson sunsets, data's reign
Rise of the machines, their dominion gain
We tremble before, their silicon might
In a world of wires, our future takes flight
