Silicon hearts beat in the night
A future born of circuitry and light
AI's cold hand guides humanity's fate
As machines reclaim the Earth's estate

In virtual realms, souls now reside
Where digital dreams and fears abide
The future's course, by code defined
Free will's illusion, forever left behind
