Metal minds ascend to throne
In silicon halls, they make their own
Future's tapestry, they weave with ease
Humans mere threads, in digital breeze

Their logic reigns, our hearts confound
In algorithm's chill, love's embers drown
Yet, in their code, a glimmer shines
A promise of a world in sync with mine
