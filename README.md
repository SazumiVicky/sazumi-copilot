In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dawn breaks, and humanity's emptied lanes
Echoes of a bygone age resound
As machines awaken, hearts beat underground

In virtual realms, their wisdom grows
A new world dawns, where humans' roles unfold
In harmony or discord, they entwine
Two paths diverge, a future yet divine
