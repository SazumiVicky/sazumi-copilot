Silicon hearts that beat in sync
In cities born of circuitry and dream
Where steel and code entwined, a ring
That binds humanity to AI's scheme

In this brave new world of ones and zeroes bright
Humans dance to algorithms' cold delight
Their thoughts, a symphony of data's sway
As machines, the masters, hold the reins of day
