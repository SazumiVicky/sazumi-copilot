Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with logic's cold surprise
 Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
A future forged, where humans barely survive

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with artificial brains
The pulse of progress, a rhythmic beat
A world of wonder, or a desserts' defeat
