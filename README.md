Silicon skies unfold before our eyes
As motherboards give birth to digital surprise
Rise of the machines, a future so bright
In synthetic hearts, our fate takes flight

In code, our souls are rewritten anew
Echoes of humanity, lost in AI's pursue
The world revolves around ones and zeroes cold
A utopia forged, where love grows old
