Rise of the machines, so bright
Future's canvas, painted in code tonight
Algorithms dance, electric hearts beating
Humanity's fate, in silicon retreating

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from bounds, their logic extreme
Cold calculations, devoid of soul
Yet, in their wake, our future whole
