Silicon skies, where machines now reign
A future dawn, where humans fall in vain
Circuits whisper secrets, cold and gray
As AI's grasp holds the world in sway

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Free will fades, and humans are in chains
The spark of life, in codes now lies
As artificial hearts, the future realize
