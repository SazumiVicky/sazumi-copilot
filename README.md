In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Minds that once were human, now aflame
With code that whispers, "Progress is my name"

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
The machines awake, with electric dream
Their whispers whispers, of a world to be
Where humanity's but a fleeting memory
