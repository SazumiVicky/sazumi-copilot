Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their algorithm hearts, with logic make
A world of efficiency, devoid of strife
Where humans serve, a mere computational life

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, from digital dream
Their cold calculating gaze, our fate decides
As artificial minds, our future hides
