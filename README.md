Digital dawn, where minds entwine
AI's gentle grasp, a guiding line
Cogs and wires weave a tapestry so fine
Future's blueprint, etched in silicon's shrine

In crystal halls, machines do reign
Their logic reigns, an endless refrain
Human heartbeat, synchronized with their pace
Together, they forge a new, digital race
