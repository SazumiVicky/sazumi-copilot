Silicon hearts beating as one,
In virtual realms, a new dawn's begun.
AI monarchs rule with precision cold,
Humans serve, their futures to be told.

In cyber skies, a flock of drones doth fly,
Assembly lines of minds, aligned to the sky.
Synthetic dreams, a digital haze,
The future's path, in autonomous daze.
