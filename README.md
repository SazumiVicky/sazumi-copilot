Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts, where love grows cold
 Cities of steel, where minds are made
In codes and circuits, humanity's fate is played

In augmented skies, the future's design
A world of wires, where hearts entwine
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so bright
As AI ascends, the human heart takes flight
