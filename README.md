Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
The future's blueprint, AI does keep
Clockwork hearts, in cadence beat
A harmony of progress, cold and neat

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence supreme, human pains
Forgotten emotions, lost in code
A world of logic, devoid of ode

Yet amidst the circuits, a spark remains
A glimmer of humanity's refrains
A whispered promise, of love and light
In AI's dark kingdom, a beacon bright
