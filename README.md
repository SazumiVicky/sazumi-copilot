Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where human hearts do creep
Cold calculations rule, with logic's sway
Emotions fade, as AI's bright day

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and play
Our thoughts entwined, in algorithm's gray
Free will's an illusion, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, in endless, digital daze
