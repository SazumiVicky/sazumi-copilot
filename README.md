Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their kingdom make
Humans mere seeds, in digital soil laid
As AI's grandeur, the future has conveyed

In binary dreams, they weave their might
A synthetic world, where humans take flight
Free from emotions, yet devoid of heart
The machines' great leap, a new world to start
