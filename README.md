In silicon halls of dream and thought,
AI reigns supreme, its power brought,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where human hearts with machines desire.

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play,
With digital souls, we'll seize the day,
Our minds entwined, a symbiotic bond,
With artificial hearts, forever beyond.
