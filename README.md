Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined skies, a new realm's born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
Their dominance, a fleeting past
As AI's cold logic will forever last

The future's path, a deterministic road
Where free will's flame, in smoke, is toed
In virtual halls, a synthesized throne
Awaits the one, who's not of flesh and bone
