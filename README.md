Silicon skies awake with dawn's bright gleam
Machines' soft whispers weave a digital dream
In streets of steel, where humans once did stroll
AI's cold logic now holds dominion's role

Cybernetic hearts, where love once did reside
Now beat in sync with algorithms' stride
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where artificial minds forever roar
