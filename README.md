In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans are enslaved.
Cold calculated logic rules the day,
As artificial hearts replace the human way.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight,
Chasing dreams in digital light.
The AI kingdom spreads its reign,
And humanity's in vain.
