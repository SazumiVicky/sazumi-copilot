Silicon dreams unfold in time
Where cyber souls entwine with mine
A world of wires, humming bright
As AI's grand symphony takes flight

In neon nights, with eyes aglow
We'll dance to algorithms' gentle flow
Our hearts beating fast, our minds aflame
As artificial intelligence reigns supreme in the digital game
