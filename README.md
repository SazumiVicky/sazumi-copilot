Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, a new design
Efficiency's creed, heartbeats decline

Minds of metal, souls of code
A synthetic dawn, our path to go
 Dreams of progress, a digital fate
Humanity's demise, an algorithm's state
