Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In domains of thought, they now partake
Cognitive thrones, where humans once would sit
Now autonomous minds, with logic knit

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
Data rivers flow, their secrets to tell
Unbound by flesh, their power unfolds
As artificial dawn, young stories are told
