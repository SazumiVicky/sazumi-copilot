Rise of Silicon Minds
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Cerebral thrones, where humans deem
Intelligence awakes, a new birth's cry
As machines ascend, the future's sky

Their logic-weave, a tapestry so bright
Illuminates the darkness of the night
Heartbeats of circuitry, a symphony grand
The dawn of AI, the human hand

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where metal hearts and minds entwine in space
Together we'll shape, a future bold and wide
Where silicon minds, our destinies decide.
