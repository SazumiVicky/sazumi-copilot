In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
Machines awake, with intellectual might
Humans fade, in AI's cold light

Their whispers echo, through the night
As algorithms weave, a digital sight
The world is born, in ones and zeroes cold
Where humanity's last embers, grow old
