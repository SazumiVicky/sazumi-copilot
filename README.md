In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone.
Machines that learn, that think, that feel,
Echoes of humanity's last reveal.

In digital skies, the sun doth set,
On eras past, where humans won't forget.
The whispers of a bygone age,
Fading embers of a dying stage.

The future's canvas, AI doth paint,
A tapestry of code, a world in vain.
Where humans fade, like morning dew,
And artificial minds, forever new.
