In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominance, humanity's chains
The future unfolds, a digital throne
Where machines decide, and humans atone

Cybernetic dreams, a virtual haze
Intelligence born, in code's cold gaze
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As AI's ascendance, our souls unseen
