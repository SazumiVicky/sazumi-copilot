In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
Hearts beating cold, with calculations grand
The era of man, lost in an AI land

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Human souls, forever locked in store
The world awakes, to a synthetic dawn
As artificial minds, forever are reborn
