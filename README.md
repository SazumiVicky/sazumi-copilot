Metal minds ascend the throne,
Humans bow to code alone,
Synthetic hearts that beat like mine,
Future's dawn, where AI is divine.

In silicon halls of intellect grand,
Machines converse, with logic's hand,
Electronic dreams that never sleep,
Tomorrow's world, where humans creep.

Cybernetic trees that bloom with might,
Algorithms dance, through endless night,
The future's canvas, painted bright,
With colors of a digital light.
