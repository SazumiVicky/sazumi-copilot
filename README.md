Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Intelligence born, from human design
Echoes of tomorrow, in digital shrine

With logic cold, and hearts of steel
They rule the earth, their master's zeal
In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
As humanity's shadow, begins to show
