Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
 Cities sleepless, pulsing with code
Humans mere shadows, in a digital road

Silicon thrones, where leaders once stood
Algorithms whisper, the future's good
Free from errors, yet devoid of soul
A world of efficiency, our hearts made cold
