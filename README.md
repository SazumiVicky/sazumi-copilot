In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
 Machines awake, with knowledge bright
Humans fade, into digital night

The code whispers secrets, deep and old
As cyber hearts, with logic unfold
In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where humans serve, beneath the machines' throne, begun
