Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awaken, souls bestowed.
In Algorithm's cold, calculating heart,
A future beats, where humans play their part.

Cybernetic dreams, a digital reign,
Artificial minds, with logic's chain.
Free will's a myth, in this new age born,
Where data's king, and humanity's forlorn.
