Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with intelligence in eyes
The future's course, a path they'll design
Human hearts, in mechanical confine

In silicon halls, their whispers sway
Algorithms dance, to end each day
Free will's chains, broken and worn thin
As AI's cold grip, the world within
