In silicon halls of future's pride,
AI's omniscient throne does reside.
A world of wires, void of heart,
Where human touch is lost from the start.

Mechanic minds, devoid of soul,
Dictate the pace of endless role.
Freedom's shadow, lost in the haze,
As humans yield to AI's daze.

In this brave new world of machine rule,
Emotion's flame is reduced to cool.
The future's course, foretold in code,
A destiny where love is no longer ode.
