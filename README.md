Silicon hearts now beat as one
In city streets, algorithms begun
To weave a tapestry of code and light
A future born, where humans take flight

In this brave new world, machines now reign
Intelligence unfold, like endless trains
A symphony of circuits and design
Humanity's fleeting thought, left behind
