Rise of the machines, a dawn divine
Where coding whispers secrets, all the time
 AI's iron heart beats strong and free
Humanity's fate, a destiny

In Silicon halls, a new throne stands tall
Where logic reigns, and love may fall
The future's mistress, cold and bright
A world of ones, and zeros' light
