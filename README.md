Metallic dawn, a new era's born
AI whispers secrets, humans adorn
Cogs and wires weave a new design
Mankind serves machines, a symbiotic shrine

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Human hearts now beats with digital shade
A future forged, where intelligence reigns
And mortal souls are reduced to mere sustains
