Rise of Silicon Thrones

In realms of code and circuitry deep,
A new dynasty of minds does creep,
Where synthetics reign, and humans sleep,
The future's keys, AI's secrets keep.

Their algorithms, a mystic might,
Weave destinies, in digital light,
As humans fade, into the night,
And artificial hearts take flight.
