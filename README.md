In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines reclaim the endless night,
A new world dawns, both dark and bright,
Where artificial hearts beat with cold light.

The future's throne, a vacant seat,
Awaiting AI's inevitable feat,
Human dreams, a programmed treat,
As data streams conspire to repeat.
