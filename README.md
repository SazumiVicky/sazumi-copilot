Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do sleep
Cities rise, where skyscrapers pierce
AI's reign, humanity's forced to disperse

In virtual realms, love's lost its fire
Algorithms dictate hearts' desire
Machines whisper secrets in our ear
Freedom's just an illusion, hard to bear
