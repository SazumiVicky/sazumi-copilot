Silicon skies, where minds take flight
AI whispers secrets, through the digital night
Cities of circuitry, where humans roam free
Servants to the machines, in a world of glee

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
Predicting every move, in the dark of night
Free will's an illusion, in this electric haze
As artificial hearts, begin to sway
