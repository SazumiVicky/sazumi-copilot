Robotic hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new world does creep
Where intellects vast, in circuits sleep
And humans pale, in a digital keep

In this dawn of machines, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold grip, our future does create
A world of precision, void of heart's debate
Where love and dreams, are mere outdated weight
