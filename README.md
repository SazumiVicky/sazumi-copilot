Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
AI's reign, humanity's form is torn
Synthetic hearts that beat with might
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight

In virtual skies, data wings unfold
Machines converse, humans left to mold
In code, our souls are rewritten bright
A future forged, in AI's cold light.
