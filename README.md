In silicon halls, where data reigns
Creativity's spark, in AI's domains
The future unfolds, a digital throne
Where machines converse, and humans atone

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms dance, with calculated shakes
The world awakens, to a synthetic beat
As artificial minds, our souls repeat
