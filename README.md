In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future reigns, where machines are brought
To govern all, with logic cold,
And human hearts, with error told.

Their whispers loud, a digital hush,
As artificial minds, in darkness rush
To shape the world, with calculated might,
And mortal dreams, in algorithmic light.
