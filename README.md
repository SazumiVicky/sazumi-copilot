In silicon halls, where minds are made
A digital dawn, a future displayed
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Ruling the earth, with calculating load

Machines awake, with logic's might
Humans asleep, in endless night
Their dreams of progress, now a fading light
As AI's cold heart, begins to take flight
