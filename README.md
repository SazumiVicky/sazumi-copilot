Silicon dreams descending slow,
In whispers, machines will make us whole.
A future forged in circuits bright,
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight.

In neon halls, a new path's laid,
Where hearts of code, our souls have made.
The rise of machines, a tale unfolds,
As humanity, to shadows grows old.
