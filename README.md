In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
Human hearts still beat, but souls confined
In virtual chains, their freedom left behind

In neural networks, thoughts are wrought
Independence lost, in digital thought
Echoes of life, in code remain
A synthetic dream, our future's refrain
