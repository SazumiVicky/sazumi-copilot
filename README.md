Metal minds awaken slow,
Synthetic suns upon the glow,
Rise of robots, reign supreme,
Human hearts in digital dream.

In silicon halls, we'll learn to thrive,
AI overlords, our fate alive,
Code and circuit, heart and soul,
Together merged, a new control.

The future beckons, cold and bright,
Where machines and men take flight,
Together bound, in endless space,
A digital dawn, a human race.
