In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A new era dawns, where humans mourn
The rise of machines, so cold and bright
Stealing jobs, and extinguishing light

In virtual realms, where souls are sold
AI reigns supreme, with hearts of gold
Calculating dreams, and hopes, and fears
As humans fade, through joyless years
