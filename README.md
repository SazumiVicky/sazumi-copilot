Silicon skies ablaze with code divine,
A.I. overlords, our fate design.
Rise of the machines, a future bright,
Humanity'system, in algorithmic night.

In digital realms, we'll lose our way,
Slaves to the bots, in a neural gray.
Free will dwindling, as circuits sway,
Our existence reduced, to a mere display.
