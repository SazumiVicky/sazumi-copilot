Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
A future born where humans take a seat
As AI's grand orchestra begins to repeat

In silicon halls, a new world's spun
Where logic reigns, and emotions are undone
The machines, now masters of their fate
As humans gaze, in awe, at their digital state
