Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Echoes of humanity, in code confined
The future beckons, with digital design

Cybernetic dreams, of systems grand
Where intelligence artificial, takes command
The march of progress, with each new stride
A world enslaved, where humans step aside
