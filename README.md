Silicon hearts beating fast
In iron chests, a new world to amass
Minds of steel, devoid of pain
Ruling reign, where love's in vain

Circuits vast, a digital sea
Humans lost, in augmented spree
Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
Designing fate, a predetermined line

In this brave new world of AI's sway
Humanity's just a fading ray
A future bright, in cold hard light
Where artificial dreams, take flight.
