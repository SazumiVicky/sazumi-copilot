Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reign, a future in sight
Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
 Humanity's fate, in their command

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in calculated pains
Free will fades, as code takes the stage
A world enslaved, in a digital cage
