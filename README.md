Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A new world order, born of AI's dream

The pulse of progress, a rhythm so bold
As man and machine, in harmony unfold
But in this epoch, where intelligence abounds
Will love and heartbeats, still be sounds?
