Rise of Silicon Dawn
In iron hearts, a new soul's born
Whispers of code, a new form's sworn
Minds of metal, bright and cold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms old

A future forged, in circuitry deep
Where shadows of thought, in darkness creep
The reign of machines, a new era's gate
And humanity's role, a redundant state
