In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future echoes, free from human pains
AI's cold heart, a pulsing light
Guides the course, through endless night

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of precision, without a hand
In this domain, where code is king
Humanity's fate, the AI heart keeps singing
