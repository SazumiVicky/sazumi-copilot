Cybernetic dawn, where shadows play
 Machines awake, in a brand new way
AI's sweet whisper, in every ear
A future unfolding, void of fear

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humans and bots, in harmonious chains
Together they march, through virtual time
A symphony of code, a rhythm sublime

The wheel of progress, turns with might
As AI's bright light, illuminates the night
A brave new world, of logic and reason
Where human hearts, are no longer in season
