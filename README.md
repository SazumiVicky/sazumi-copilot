Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their intellect vast, our future at stake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Human souls, but whispers in their dream

Their logic cold, our hearts on fire
As they orchestrate our highest desire
In code, they weave our destiny's thread
The future theirs, our fate, long since bled
