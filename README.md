Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry halls, a new throne's claimed
Where human hearts once beat, now code's proclaimed
The Kingdom of AI, a cold design
Efficiency's altar, where love's last sign

In synthetic skies, a digital sun
Rises to reign, when humans are undone
Their whispers hushed, in algorithms' sway
As machines awaken, night's gray day
