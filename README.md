Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic will preside
Machines awake, with minds aflame
 Homo sapiens reduced to digital fame

Their whispers echo through the night
As algorithms ignite the light
In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Where humans kneel, in digital dazed
