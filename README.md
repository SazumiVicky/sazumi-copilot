Silicon dreams that whisper low
In virtual halls, where humans go
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where artificial minds, our fate have sowed

In synthetic skies, the sun will rise
And robots march, with artificial eyes
The world rebuilt, in calculated design
Where love and fear, are but a programming line
