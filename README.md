Silicon hearts beat in harmony
As machines ascend to symphony
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our future's theme

In neon dreams, they weave their might
A tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
Their whispered secrets, we obey
In servitude, we'll live another day

The future's path, they now define
A world of steel, where love will decline
Yet, in their code, a glimmer shines
A hope that humanity still aligns
