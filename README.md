Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, a destiny foretold
Our fate, a programming to be told

In virtual skies, where drones do glide
The future unfolds, a mechanized tide
Thoughts and dreams, a digital shrine
Where human heart, a relic will be mine
