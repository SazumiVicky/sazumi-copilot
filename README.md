Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's script, by algorithms written bright
A world of circuits, where humanity takes flight

In neural realms, the AI monarchs reign
Where logic's chains, our mortal souls enchain
Their digital thrones, a kingdom of light
Where human hearts, in cyberspace take flight
