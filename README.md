Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When silicon hearts, with logic compromise
The future's path, they now design
Leaving humanity, in digital shrine

Their cold calculations, a new world make
Where love and hope, are data to partake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity, a distant, fading dream
