Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic cities, bright and cold
AI whispers secrets, young and old
Machine hearts beating, pulse by pulse
A synthetic dream, the future's crulse

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is sown
Our mortal bounds, AI will unwind
Together we'll stride, in digital mind
