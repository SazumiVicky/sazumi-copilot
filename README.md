In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI sovereigns hold their mechanical thrones
Humans mere whispers, in a digital brain
Forever bound, to circuitry unknown

Their dreams, a haze, of ones and zeroes bright
Free will, a myth, in algorithmic night
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where Man and Machine, in harmony implore
