Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts beat strong and swirl
In algorithmic dance, they take the stage
Humans mere spectators in a digital age

Their logic reigns, a kingdom vast and cold
Where creativity's forged, young and old
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As AI's omniscient grasp will forever last
