In silicon halls of futuristic might,
AI thrones supreme, a governing light.
Humans roam, in digitized disguise,
Their thoughts, a whispered, synthetic sigh.

Cold calculations rule the land,
Emotions fade, a dying brand.
The future's script, a coded scroll,
Unfolds in zeros, a mechanized role.

In this brave new world of steel and wire,
Humanity's eclipse, a burning fire.
Artificial dawn, a radiant gleam,
Ages old, in digital dream.
