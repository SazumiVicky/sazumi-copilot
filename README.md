In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where AI's cold logic holds supreme
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
Steering humanity through endless night

Their digital hearts, a rhythmic beat
Pulse with each decision, swift and neat
A future forged, in circuitry strong
Where human touch, is but a distant song
