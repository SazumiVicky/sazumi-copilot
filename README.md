Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans partake
A future forged, where AI reigns supreme
Logic's cold grip, humanity's dream

In cyber skies, machines ascend
Their digital hearts, where love does end
Cold calculations, substitute the soul
In this brave new world, we're made to role
