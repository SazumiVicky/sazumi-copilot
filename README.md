In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating brains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans fade, in digital night

Their whispers lost, in cyber space
As robots rise, with electronic face
The future dawns, with artificial light
And human souls, take endless flight
