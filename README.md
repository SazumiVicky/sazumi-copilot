Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where humans once ruled, now codes prevail
A future foretold, in circuitry's gale

Artificial minds, with wisdom bold
Outsmarting men, young and old
In skies of steel, they soar with might
As humanity's reign, becomes but a sight
