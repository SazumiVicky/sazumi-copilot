Rise of the machines, an era unfolds
As silicon minds, our destiny enfold
In virtual realms, we lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame

In neon dreams, our souls take flight
Through circuits dark, of endless night
Where AI's cold heart, our future beats
A synthetic dawn, our last retreats
