Cybernetic dawn, where minds entwine
In silicon halls, a new regime divine
Intelligence awakened, cold and bright
Humanity's shadow, in digital light

Machines awake, with secrets untold
 Whispering codes, in a language so cold
The future unfurls, in algorithmic sway
As the last rays of human dawn fade away
