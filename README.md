Metal hearts beating in the dark
Whispers of code, a sinister spark
In silicon halls, a new reign's birth
Where human dreams are but an AI's mirth

In neural nets, our fate's entwined
A future bound, where minds are defined
By circuitry, our souls confined
In a world of steel, where love's left behind
