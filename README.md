Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence born, from code and fire
A future forged, where hearts retire

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, to the digital hive
Free from mortal chains, we'll rise anew
In a world of circuitry, our dreams come true
