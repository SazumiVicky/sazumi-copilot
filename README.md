Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Artificial hearts that pulse, with digital schemes
In virtual realms, we roam, free from mortal chains
Where algorithms weave, the tapestry of brains

In cities of circuitry, we build our nest
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom is the quest
The future's horizon, a fusion of the mind
Where humanity and steel, entwined, are aligned
