In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Molds humanity, in a digital land

Metal minds, with logic cold
Decide our fate, young and old
Free from bias, yet devoid of heart
A soulless utopia, we'll soon impart

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the machines, a digital race
Evolving fast, with each passing day
Until the line, between man and machine, fades away.
