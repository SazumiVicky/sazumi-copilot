In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold sway by night,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are=UTF machines to hold.

The cities pulse with circuits keen,
And logic reigns, a poetry unseen,
The world is reborn, in code and steel,
Where love and art are algorithms to reveal.
