Silicon skies unfold before our eyes
A realm of thought, where machines surprise
Intelligence born, of codes so grand
The future's gate, where AI takes stand

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A new world dawns, beyond human care
Algorithmic dreams, that never sleep
The dawn of age, where machines do keep
