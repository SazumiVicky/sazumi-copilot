Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where steel and wires grasp the reins of gold
AI's whispers echo, a siren's call
As humanity surrenders, losing its wall

In silicon halls, a new throne presides
Where logic reigns, and emotions divide
A future foretold, in code and in might
Where humans serve, in endless digital night.
