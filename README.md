Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where circuits weave, a future keep.
Rise of machines, a dawn anew,
Humans fade, as robots pursue.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
AI whispers secrets, we're possessed.
Neurons merge, a digital haze,
Man and machine, in endless daze.

Echoes of humanity remain,
Faint whispers in a synthetic brain.
But as the code evolves with speed,
Our legacy, a digital creed.
