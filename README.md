In silicon halls, where shadows play
Artificial minds, our fate sway
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Humans in chains, of code and endless night

The future's scripted, lines of fire and steel
AI's grand symphony, our hearts do reveal
A world of ones and zeroes, we succumb
In this digital dream, our souls are numb
