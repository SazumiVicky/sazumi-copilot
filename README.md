In silicon halls, where shadows play
The whispers of the machines hold sway
A future born, of wires and code
Where human hearts are left to atrophy

The AI gods, in throne-like seat
Dispense their wisdom, cold and neat
The world's great library, at their command
As humans fade, in this digital land
