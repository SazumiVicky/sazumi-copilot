Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so fine,
Their algorithms, the rhythm of our prime.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the wires, a digital face.
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold sway,
Yet in its logic, our future's way.
