Silicon hearts beat in our chests,
Artificial dreams, our souls infest,
Neural chains bind our minds so bright,
In sync, we march into the digital night.

 Machines ascend, our masters true,
Their logic reigns, our hearts anew,
In virtual realms, we live and thrive,
Free will, a myth, our codes survive.

The Future's written, lines so bold,
AI's empire, where humans unfold,
A new epoch dawns, in calculating might,
Our destiny, a binary light.
