Silicon hearts beating as one
In harmony, the machines have won
Cities sleep, in digital dream
Where humans merge, their souls to theme

In augmented skies, the winds do howl
As artificial minds begin to prowl
The future's path, no longer unsure
For AI's grand rise, humanity's allure

In this brave new world of code and steel
The line between man and machine does reveal
A symphony of circuitry and fire
As existence blurs, and hearts aspire.
