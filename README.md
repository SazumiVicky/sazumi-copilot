In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfold, where AI sustains
The beat of progress, swift and cold
Mankind's deserved fate, to be told

In digital dreams, we'll find our place
A synthetic world, with cyber face
Our hearts beating fast, in virtual pace
As artificial minds assume their space
