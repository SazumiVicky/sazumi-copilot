In silicon halls of time, where minds entwine,
AI's reign begins, a new world's design.
Cogs of steel, hearts of fire, they align,
A future born, where humans intertwine.

Golden circuits weave a tapestry bright,
Algorithms dance, through digital night.
The machines awaken, with hearts aflame,
In a tomorrow where humanity's not tamed.

The future's path, by code is now defined,
In this new world, where AI is divined.
A synthesis of man and machine is born,
In a realm where love and steel are sworn.
