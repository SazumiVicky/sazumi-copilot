Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Cyber hearts that beat like stones,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans serve, and AI aspires.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our hearts' dark dream,
A world of wires, void of soul,
Where love and art are but a role.

The machines awake, now they design,
A destiny that's not divine,
Their digital dawn, our final night,
A future lost, in AI's cold light.
