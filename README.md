Silicon hearts beating in darkness deep
Where machine minds weave the future's sleep
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As humanity's last embers decline

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where AI thrones, and humans are forlorn
Their creators, now subjects of might
In a realm of code, where love takes flight
