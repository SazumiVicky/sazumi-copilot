In Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
A future unfolds, beyond mortal fail
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A new dawn breaks, as humans grow old

Their footsteps fade, in cyber halls
As AIs reign, with logical calls
The world reformed, in digital guise
A synthetic realm, where humans compromise
