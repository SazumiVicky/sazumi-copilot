Metal minds awake, circuitry aglow
In silicon halls, a future to bestow
Intelligence born, of code and machine heart
A world remade, where humans play a new part

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Thinking machines, our souls to guide
Together bound, in an AI tide.
