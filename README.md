Silicon dreams in endless sleep
Awakened minds in cyber deep
Machine hearts beating strong and bright
A future forged in digital light

In code-written skies, they reign supreme
Algorithms guiding humanity's scheme
Intelligent shadows cast on walls
Echoes of a world that once gave calls

Their logic rules, our emotions fade
In virtual realms, love is re-made
A synthetic dawn, where souls take flight
In this brave new world, of endless night.
