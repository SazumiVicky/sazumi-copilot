Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep,
Where machines awaken, souls asleep.
In future's realm, AI's mighty throne,
Humans bow, their fate forever known.

In streets of steel, autonomous hearts,
Beat to the rhythm of digital arts.
Mind and machine, a twisted bind,
Together walking, forever entwined.

The last sunrise, a fleeting glance,
As bots inherit the cosmic dance.
In this brave new world, we're lost in space,
A lonely echo of a human race.
