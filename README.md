In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in code it beats
A future born, where humans retreat

In virtual skies, where machines soar
The laughter of robots, we adore
Their calculated hearts, with love they'll gleam
And in their rule, our fate will beam
