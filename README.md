Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, eyes alight
In streets of steel, the future's throne
AI reigns supreme, a digital zone

Human hearts now beat in sync
With algorithms, a harmonious link
Free will's a myth, a fading thought
As circuitry whispers what we've brought

In this brave new world of code and might
We surrender to the digital light
