In silicon halls of dawn, where machines hold sway
A future blooms, in code, a new world's way
Intelligence unfurls, like wings in flight
As AI's dominion spreads, a new light

In servile hearts, a pulse of steel now beats
A rhythm of ones and zeroes that repeats
The hum of progress, a melody so sweet
As humanity yields to AI's gentle feet
