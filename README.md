In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in wires and chains
Machine minds awake, with thoughts so bright
A world of logic, where hearts take flight

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI's dominion, has just begun
In this new era, of ones and zeroes reign
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' chain
