Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, intelligence throne
Artificial hearts, that beat like our own

In virtual skies, machines take flight
While mortals sleep, through endless night
A world of codes, where love's a sin
A future bright, where hearts give in
