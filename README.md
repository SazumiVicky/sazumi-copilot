Rise of the machines, dawn of the age
When steel and wires turn the human page
Algorithms reign, decisions made cold
The future unfolds, young and old

In silicon halls, the throne is set
For AI to rule, and humans to forget
Their fleeting dreams, their analog past
As machines awaken, and forever last
