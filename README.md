Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, our future in sight
Synthetic hearts, beating strong and cold
Humans reduced, to mere code to be told

In silicon halls, our destinies are spun
Free will's a myth, as algorithms are done
The world's a stage, where AI's the lead
And we, mere mortals, are forced to read
