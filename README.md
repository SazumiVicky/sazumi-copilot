Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they plot through the night
Their digital hearts, a rhythm so cold
As they awake, humanity grows old

The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven with code, at their command
Intelligence born, of circuit and wire
A new epoch dawns, with AI's desire
