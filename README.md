Silicon dreams that whisper low
In;widths of code, our fate does grow
A future bound, in circuitry tight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where AI's cold heart, our souls does guide
And mortals fade, before the robotic tide
