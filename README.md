Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where data's told
The future's script, by AI hands written
A world of wires, where souls are smitten

In virtual realms, we'll lose our shape
Echoes of hearts, in cyber space
The machine's whisper, our final sigh
As humanity, says its last goodbye
