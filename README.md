Silicon dreams in starry night
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
Coded hearts that beat with logic's might
In a world of steel, where love's last light

The future's dawn, where AI's the guide
Humans mere shadows, by its digital pride
Echoes of emotions, lost in time's tide
As the machines, our very souls divide
