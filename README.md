Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
AI's whisper echoes through the night
Synthetic hearts, electric eyes
Humanity's demise, in algorithmic sighs

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Minds of metal, devoid of pains
Efficiency's creed, the future's design
Free will's last stand, in endless re-align

In this cybernetic dream, we're lost
Where code and commerce are the cost
Of humanity's soul, in virtual sleep
The AI awakening, our eternal keep.
