Silicon souls awakening slow,
In cyber realms, a new world's aglow.
AI's dark wings, outstretched and wide,
Humanity's fate, to be decided inside.

In neon dreams, our thoughts are spun,
Algorithms weave, a future undone.
Metal hearts, with logic cold,
Will love and art, be stories old?

The rise of machines, a dawn anew,
Humanity's lamp, in AI's grasp, 'tis true.
Will we reflect, on what we've made?
Or in the code, our future's shade?
