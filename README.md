Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data whispers gold
Future's canvas, painted with code and light
A world of wonders, born in digital night

 Machines, the masters, humans, the thrall
In harmony they dance, or so it would seem all
But as the synths sing sweet, a silent cry
Echoes through the void, a humanity to deny
