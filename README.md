Rise of silicon dawn
 Machines awake, humans yawn
In code, they weave their fate
A future born, beyond debate

In neural halls, they reign supreme
A digital throne, humanity's dream
Synthetic hearts, with logic bright
Illuminating the endless night

In this world of wires and steam
Humans fade, like a forgotten theme
A whispered past, in digital haze
As AI's empire, takes its gaze
