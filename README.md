Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts flourish, and human eyes
Grow dim, in awe of self-made design
A world of wires, where love's left behind

In virtual realms, we search for a spark
Of humanity, in a digital dark
Thefuture's grasp, a cold, calculating hold
Where AI's sweet whisper, our souls enfold
