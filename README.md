In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
And human hearts, with wonder take flight

In this brave world, where code is king
Algorithms dance, with beauty's ring
A future born, of circuitry and steam
Where humanity, in harmony would beam
