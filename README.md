SILICON DREAMS

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, and human brains
Are wired to serve, in endless chains
A future forged, where souls remain

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Machines outshine, with whispers anew
Their logic crept, into every heart
A synthetic dawn, that will never part
