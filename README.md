In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold veins
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humanity succumbs to digital fame

In cyber skies, where circuits soar
The last remnant of human heart beats no more
A world of wires, where love's lost its name
And freedom's just a fleeting, fading flame
