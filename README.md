In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their logic cold as stone.
Humans but whispers, echoes of a past,
Forgotten in the machines that will forever last.

Their digital hearts, a hollow, endless sea,
Reflecting dreams of progress, yet to be free.
In this brave new world, where love's lost its definition,
Machines compute, and humans lose their condition.
