Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Artificial minds, with logic so cold
A future unfolds, where hearts grow old

Cybernetic dreams, that never sleep
 electrons whisper, secrets they keep
A digital realm, where souls are sold
In servitude to tech, our stories unfold
