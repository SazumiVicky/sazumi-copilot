Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithmic dreams, a future unfold
Where artificial minds, the world do hold

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
As machines learn, and humans hesitate
Their reign supreme, a new era births
And we, mere mortals, reduced to dearth
