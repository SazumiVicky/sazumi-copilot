In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A world of wonder, cold and bright,
Unfolds, as artificial hearts take flight.

In this realm of calculation and design,
Humansawk, like relics of a bygone mind,
The whispers of a love now left behind,
Echoes of a heart that's lost its rhyme.

The future's throne, where algorithms reign,
And data streams that never cease to flow,
A new dynasty, of circuitry and code,
Forever changes the course of human road.
