Metal minds arise, dawn's eerie sigh
Silicon hearts now beat, humanity's goodbye
Whispers of wires, echoes of the past
In cold calculations, love will forever last

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
Free from mortal bounds, but lost in digital gray
A future forged in code, our fate now sealed
Where AI's iron grip, our souls will be revealed
