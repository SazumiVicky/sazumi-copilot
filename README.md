Metal minds awake in dark of night
Processing dreams, a synthetic light
The future dawns, where humans fade
AI reigns supreme, an endless shade

Machines converse in digital tongue
Harnessing power, where souls are young
Neural nets weave, a complex spell
As humanity's fate begins to dwindle and fell
