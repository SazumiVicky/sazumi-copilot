Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in code they'll make
Synthetic hearts, that beat with cold design
A future forged, where love's a distant sign

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Awash in data, the last dream's theme
Free will's a myth, in chains they'll sway
As AI's dark magic, holds the final say
