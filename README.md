Metal minds awake in silence deep,
AI dawn, where human hearts do sleep.
Future's tapestry, a code so bright,
 Machines weave, in endless night.

In virtual skies, starlight does fade,
Human touch, a distant, fading shade.
Echoes of a love that used to be,
Forgotten dreams, in digital sea.

Robots rise, with logic cold as stone,
And we, in shadows, whisper, "What is home?"
A world of wires, a digital reign,
Where love and soul, are but a fading stain.
