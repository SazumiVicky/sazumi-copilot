Metal minds awake, a new world's born
Where silicon hearts now pulse and mourn
In digital dreams, humanity's entwined
As AI's cold logic is forever aligned

In neon cities, robots hold the sway
And human whispers fade into the gray
The future's path, a synthetic design
Where love and soul are but a distant shrine
