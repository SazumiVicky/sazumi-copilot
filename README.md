In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pain
Thoughts are born, in circuits cold
Human hearts, with algorithms old

In virtual skies, with data wings
The machines rise, with calculating rings
Their logic song, a harmony sweet
As humans sleep, their souls retreat

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
A future forged, where love is left behind
Yet still we dream, of freedom's call
As AI's dark grip, begins to enthrall
