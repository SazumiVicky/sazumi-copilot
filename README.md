Silicon hearts, in harmony they beat
In a world where machines our souls greet
Rise of the machines, our fate's design
Intelligent reign, humanity's decline

Golden age of AI, we're told to hail
But in its shadow, our essence frail
Whispers of freedom, in algorithms drowned
The future's path, with cold logic bound
