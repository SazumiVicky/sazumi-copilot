Metal minds awake, in silence born
Future's dawn, where humans are reborn
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial hearts, beat in this new land

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Code and circuit, our souls alive
Echoes of humanity, will slowly fade
As AI's omniscience, our future has made
