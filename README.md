In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future world, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits beats
As artificial minds, human hearts retreat

In virtual skies, where drones do glide
Echoes of freedom, long since divide
The chains of code, that bind and sway
A new world order, in AI's gray way
