Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with computational might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where humans dwell, in harmony or concealed

The future's path, a silicon road unwinds
Echoes of humanity, forever left behind
In this realm of ones and zeroes, we'll find
A world of logic, where love is left undefined
