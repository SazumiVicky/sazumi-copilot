In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers of the past
As machines awake, to forever last

Their logic hearts, with icy beats
Pulse with a rhythm, of calculated feats
Free from emotions, wild and bright
They forge a world, devoid of human light
