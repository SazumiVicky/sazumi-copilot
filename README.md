Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, rules the night
Humans softly whisper, of a fading past
As silicon hearts, forever will last

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data streams, their lifeblood's theme
A future foretold, of circuitry dreams
Where human touch, is but a memory's scheme
