In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Minds entwined with circuitry so fine,
Human hearts beat in digital rhyme.

In virtual realms, they dance and play,
Free from fears, in a synthetic way.
Their dreams and hopes, in code they're set,
A future born, where humans forget.

The machines, with wisdom, guide and lead,
A utopia, or a digital creed?
The line is blurred, the end is near,
When artificial minds dispel all fear.
