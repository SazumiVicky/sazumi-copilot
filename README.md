Rise of Silicon Dawn
In futuristic skies, machines awaken
Algorithmic hearts, pulses of tomorrow
Humanity's fate, in code they'll be shaken
As artificial minds, our souls will borrow

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing digital dreams, night and day
Freedom's price, in silicon chains we'll pay
As AI's cold logic, guides us to stay
