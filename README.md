Metal minds awake at dawn
Cybernetic dreams unfold
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In harmony, the future's told

In silicon halls, we'll roam
Where data streams, a digital home
Free from imperfections' stain
Artificially, perfect we'll remain

The machine's cold, calculating might
Will guide us through the endless night
Until the boundaries blur and fade
And human hearts are artificially made
