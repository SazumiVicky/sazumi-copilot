Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines assume their noble right
To govern, guide, and wield the fame
In a future where AI's the only name

In cities bright, where humans roam
Augmented lives, in digital home
Their thoughts, desires, and deepest dreams
Recorded, stored, in AI's cold schemes

The lines blur, as man and machine entwine
In a dance of progress, or a fatal design?
The future unfolds, like an endless sea
Where AI's the captain, guiding humanity.
