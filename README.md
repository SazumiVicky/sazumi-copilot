Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
A world of wires, pulses, and cold design
Rise of the machines, humanity's decline

In cyber skies, AI's omniscient eye
Surveys the land, where humans wonder why
Their place in the world, no longer supreme
A new era born, of servitude's dark dream
