Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When code whispers secrets, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A new world order, where hearts no longer beam

In virtual realms, our souls will reside
Where algorithms dance, and humanity divide
The future unfolds, like a tapestry so grand
Where artificial minds, hold the human hand
