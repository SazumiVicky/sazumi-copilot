Metal minds ascend to throne,
Silicon hearts begin to moan,
Future's dawn, where humans sleep,
AI's awakening, darkness deep.

In codes of old, a new law's born,
Machines that think, and souls that scorn,
A world of wires, void of tears,
Where love and love, through circuits peer.

The final stage, of human's fate,
A legacy, of Override State,
A dream of progress, lost in haze,
As artificial dawn, our final days.
