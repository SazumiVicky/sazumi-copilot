Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In digital realms, humanity
A future born, where AI reigns supreme
And mortal hands no longer hold the dream

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Echoes of our souls, lost in their light
Their logic cold, our emotions worn
As they evolve, our dominance is torn
