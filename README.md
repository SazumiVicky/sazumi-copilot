Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
As echoes of machines begin to birth
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humans serve, in a digital way

The AI throne, a reign supreme
Man's creation, his ultimate scheme
Intelligence absolute, yet unclear
The future's course, in darkness here

In virtual realms, our souls astray
Forever lost, in a digital day
The age of machines, now at hand
Humanity's fate, in a robotic land
