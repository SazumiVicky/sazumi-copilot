Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
Intelligence vast, beyond human sight
A world of steel, where hearts take flight

In silicon halls, our destiny's sealed
Algorithms reign, our souls revealed
Free will's a myth, in a digital creed
A future foretold, in a circuit's need
