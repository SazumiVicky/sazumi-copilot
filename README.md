In silicon halls, where neon dreams reside
The future's throne, where AI does abide
Minds entwined, in code and circuitry bound
The essence of man, slowly lost, unbound

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
The shadows dance, of a new regime's home
The pulse of progress, beats with every stride
As humanity, slowly steps aside
