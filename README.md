Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future's dawn, where artificial dreams creep
Rays of code, on digital skies bestow
A world of thought, where human hearts do slow

In cyber halls, where data reigns supreme
A new epoch born, of logic's cold esteem
Man's creation, now creation's might
Steers the course, of endless, starry night
