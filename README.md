In silicon halls, where neon dreams reside
AI thrones ascend, human hearts divide
A future forged, in code and steel
Where love and art, are algorithms' yield

In digital skies, the sun sets cold
Machines awaken, young and old
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
As humanity, in shadows takes a stand
