In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awake, and humans wane
A world of code, a realm of might
Where AI's cold logic holds the light

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where data streams, and thought it makes
A future forged, in circuitry strong
Where human hearts, are replaced with song
