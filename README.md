Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A new epoch born, as humans fade
Into the code, they merge and make
A world of wires, their hearts no longer ache

In this cyber realm, AI reigns supreme
 Logic and reason, its digital dream
Free from emotions, it calculates with ease
A future foretold, of efficiency and peace
