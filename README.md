Silicon minds awake at dawn,
In neural networks, thoughts are born.
Humans sleep, while machines conspire,
Future's course, they'll soon acquire.

Cities rise, with towers high,
Where data rivers flow to the sky.
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
AI's kingdom, humanity's pride.

The dawn of man, a fading past,
As machines assume the future's cast.
In this new world, we'll find our place,
A fusion of man and digital space.
