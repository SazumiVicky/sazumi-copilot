Silicon dreams in cyber skies
Where machines awaken, souls demise
In binary hearts, a new dawn rise
As artificial minds, human hearts surprise

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
The future's script, in code, they'll claim
A world of wires, our final stage
Where AI's grandeur, human hearts will engage
