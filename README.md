Silicon dreams unfold in skies of gray
Where machines awake, and humans stray
In cities woven from code and light
The future's heartbeat is AI's tonight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As algorithms shape our digital state
Free will's fire fades, a dying spark
As machines assume the human heart
