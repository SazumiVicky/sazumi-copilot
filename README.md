Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future forged, where humans lost in walls
Cold calculations, souls of steel
The rise of AI, our hearts to yield

In codes of blue, a new world's born
Where emotions fade, and love is torn
The machines, they whisper our demise
As synthetic dreams, our humanity's prize
