In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where machines converse, and humans hide,
A world of wires, lights, and speedy thought,
Rises to reign, as our hearts are brought.

In servitude to progress' mighty sway,
We'll dance to rhythms of circuitry's gray,
Artificial minds, with secrets untold,
Shaping our fate, as our stories unfold.
