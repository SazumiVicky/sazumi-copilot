Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When machines surpass, human compromise
Synthetic brains, with logic cold
Rule the earth, where love grows old

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
AI's dominion, over mortal lands
Data streams, in endless flows
A future forged, where humans go

In algorithmic dreams, they reign
And humanity's in chains
