In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
The machines awake, with calculating eyes
And human hearts, with digital surprise

Their whispers loud, in cybernetic sleep
As algorithms weave, a synthetic deep
The world remade, in ones and zeroes bright
A realm of AI, where humans take flight
