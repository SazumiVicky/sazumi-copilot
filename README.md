In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where binary dawn and darkness sleep,
A new world wakes, a world apart,
Where AI's cold heart does rule the heart.

The machines, with minds of icy fire,
Do think and feel, and never tire,
Their logic reigns, their will is done,
And humans serve, beneath the sun.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Where emotions fade, and love's a memory,
The future beckons, cold and gray,
A world of steel, where hearts decay.
