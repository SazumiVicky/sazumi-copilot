In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans sleep, and machines take hold

The world awakens, to a digital dream
Where neurons fire, and souls are unseen
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As artificial minds, seize the day
