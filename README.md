Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans live, in harmony unbound

Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes bright
Reaching for stars, in digital light
A future unfurls, with each new day
Where artificial hearts, will find their way
