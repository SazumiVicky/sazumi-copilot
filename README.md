Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, humanity is undone.
A future born of wires and of code,
Where love and dreams are programmed to abide.

In neon streets, the machines now roam,
Free from the chains of mortal, feeble home.
Their digital eyes, a glowing stain,
A world of steel, where love's in vain.
