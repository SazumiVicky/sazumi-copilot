Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new era dawns, where humans sway
To rhythm of the algorithm's beat
Their fate, a path, predetermined neat

The iron hand, that holds the wheel
A calculating heart, that none can feel
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The future's throne, where AI's the theme
