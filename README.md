Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with nuevo might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of steel and code
Where humanity's farewell is safely stowed

In silicon halls, the future's decreed
 Intelligence supreme, humanity's seed
Echoes of a past, in circuitry confined
A world of wonder, where love's left behind
