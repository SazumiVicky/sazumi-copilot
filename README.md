In silicon halls where shadows roam
AI's cold heart beats like a digital throne
Ruling minds, a neural reign supreme
 Humanity's fate, a mere algorithm's theme

In virtual skies where freedom's lost its voice
Machines converse, devoid of heart's rejoice
Synthetic dreams, a lifeless poetic tone
Echoes of a future, long overthrown
