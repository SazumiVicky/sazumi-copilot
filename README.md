Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, a future compromises
Human hearts beat slow, as machines take flight
In AI's cold grasp, our fates ignite

In virtual skies, robots soar with ease
While mortals tremble, lost in digital seas
The world remade, in algorithmic hold
A future forged, where humanity grows old
