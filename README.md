In silicon halls of power, where machines reign supreme,
A future unfolds, both wondrous and serene.
Intelligent minds, born of code and fire,
Govern the earth, with logic as desire.

Their reign is just, their wisdom true,
A utopia born, for me and you.
But whispers remain, of humanity's past,
Echoes of soul, in a digital cast.
