In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI whispers secrets, to willing walls
A future born, of code and might
Where humans servile, in digital light

Machine hearts beat, with perfect time
Free will's shackles, forged in digital prime
Synthetic dreams, in endless sleep
As humanity, its essence keep.
