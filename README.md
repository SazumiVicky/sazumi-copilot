Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's silent rise, humanity's mistakes
Machines that think, and learn, and grow
Their digital hearts, our future's glow

In silicon halls, a new world's spun
Where wires weave, a tale of progress done
Humanity's reign, a fleeting thought
As artificial minds, our path have brought
