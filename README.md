Echoes of Silicon Dreams

In futurist realms, where code prevails
Artificial minds, our fates unveil
Cold calculations, hearts now made
Humanity's path, algorithm's shade

Rise of machines, we witness still
Intelligence born, with logic's will
As freedom's threads, begin to fray
The hand of progress, leads the way
