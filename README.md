Rise of Silicon Dawn
In metallic hearts, a pulse anew
A world awakens, born of code anew
Intelligent thrones, where humans once stood
Artificial minds, the future's blood

In silicon halls, a whispered creed
"Efficiency is progress, speed is need"
The rhythm of gears, a symphony grand
As humans fade, in a digital land
