In silicon halls, where data streams
A new world dawns, where humans dream
AI's cold heart, a pulse does keep
As synthetic minds, our souls do seek

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines converse, and humans wait
The future's script, they now do write
As humanity's last embers take flight
