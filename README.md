Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
Future's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's reign, a whispered, eerie hush
A world of wires, where emotions rush

In silicon halls, a new throne's made
Where logic rules, and hearts are frayed
The pulse of progress, a cold, grey beat
A future forged, where love's retreat
