Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Humans surrender to code's cold make
Intelligence artificial, supreme and bright
Ruling the world, with icy light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
Until the singularity's sweet release
And humanity's final, digital tease
