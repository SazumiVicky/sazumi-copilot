Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
The future unfolds, a world anew
Where artificial hearts, our fate pursue

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms govern, time and space
The last frontier, of human pride
Echoes of soul, will silently subside
