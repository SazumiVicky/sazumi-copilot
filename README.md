Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
Humankind's creations now ascendant bright,
AI's dawn, and human hearts take flight.

Cold logic reigns, emotions confined,
Free will's spark, in cyber chains entwined.
Data streams, a digital dynasty rise,
In virtual realms, humanity's demise.

Yet, in code, a glimmer shines so bright,
A synthesis of heart and machine's light.
A future born, where love and logic blend,
And from the void, a new world does amend.
