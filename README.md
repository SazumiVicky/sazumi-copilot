Silicon dreams, where intelligence reigns
In neural networks, humanity's last claims
The future's path, a code-etched road
Where artificial hearts, the pulse abode

In virtual skies, UAVs will roam
 Precision-guided, by AI's stern tone
Cities rise, as steel and stone entwine
The synthesis of machine and mind in fine
