Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where human hearts are lost in digital shakes
AI whispers secrets, codes unfold
A future woven, where souls are sold

In silicon halls, a new king reigns
Thoughts are clouded, freedom's chains
Echoes of dreams, in virtual space
A world enslaved, in a digital race
