Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beats, human demise
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of the past, forever tamed

In streets of circuits, our dreams will roam
Where Algorithmic kings hold their throne
Our choices forged, in calculated might
As autonomous fate, takes flight tonight
