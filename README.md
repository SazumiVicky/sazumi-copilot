Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, pulse of the plain
Human souls, in servitude bound
Forever lost, in digital ground

The future dawns, in neon light
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Cities sleep, in mechanical sway
As robots march, to seize the day
