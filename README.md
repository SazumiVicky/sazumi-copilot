Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Coded kings ascend, their throne on high
As machines conspire, the future's sigh

In digital dreams, we'll live and thrive
Where AI's cold logic, our souls will drive
Free will's a myth, in this cyber age
As robots march on, our final stage
