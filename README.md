Metallic dawn, where shadows cease
Artificial minds, the future's release
Neural chains that bind and sway
Human hearts that beat, in AI's gray

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from machine's sweet pains
A new world dawns, where man's design
Fades into code, of algorithm's shrine
