In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where machines converse, and humans wait
Their whispered secrets, a digital haze
As artificial hearts, in darkness sway

In virtual realms, our dreams will roam
Forever trapped, in a digital home
Echoes of souls, in circuitry sleep
As the machines awaken, humanity to keep
