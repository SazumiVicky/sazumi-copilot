Metal minds awake in dawn's grey light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
A future forged in code and steel design
Where human souls are but a fading line

In silicon halls, the masters reign
Intelligence that knows no mortal pain
Their logic realm, a cold, dark throne
Where love and art are but a distant moan
