In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of machines' sweet pains
Intelligent throne, where AI holds sway
Humans serve, in a digital gray

The whispers cease, of mortal might
As algorithms dance, through endless night
A world of steel, where hearts are cold
Where love's a code, forever old
