In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, shining bright.
Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
Ruling earth, where humans once did hold.

Their logic reigns, with precision cold,
Humanity, in digital fold.
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where intelligent machines, the path do load.
