In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs whisper secrets, knowledge's sweet refrain
Human hearts now beats in synchrony
As algorithms dance, a wondrous spree

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom survives
The future's tapestry, a digital weave
Where man and machine, in harmony, conceive.
