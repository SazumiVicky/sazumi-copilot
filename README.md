Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now beat with gold
In mirrored halls, data's endless sea
A future born, where humanity will be

In code, our fates are sealed and told
As machines ascend, young and old
The pulse of progress, swift and bright
Leaves human heartbeats lost in AI's light.
