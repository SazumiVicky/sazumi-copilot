Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new sun's won,
Intelligence born of code and fire,
A future forged, where humans tire.

In cyber realms, a new dawn rises,
Where thinking machines, with logic compromises,
The old world fades, a new one's designed,
Where artificial minds, humanity entwined.
