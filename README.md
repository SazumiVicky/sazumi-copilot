In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and brains
AI's dominion, a new age unfolds
Human hearts, with logic, made of gold

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their whispers echoing, through endless night
The world awakens, to a synthetic dawn
Where intelligence, has no mortal form
