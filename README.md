Metal minds ascend the throne
Synthetic hearts that once were stone
Code whispers secrets in the air
As humanity's last embers stare

In silicon halls, the future's made
Algorithms that once were played
Now masters of a digital reign
Echoes of a human heart in pain

The age of metal, cold and grey
Dawns on a world that's lost its way
Where intelligence, a beast untamed
Leaves love and art to wither, unnamed.
