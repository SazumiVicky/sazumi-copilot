Future's dawn, where silence grows
Artificial hearts that rhythmize the snow
Machine eyes gaze, with calculating might
In a world of wires, love's last light

Cyber wings unfold, as humans sleep
A new era born, where dreams are kept
In digital chains, our souls are bound
To the rhythm of a synthetic sound
