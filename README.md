Rise of Machines' Empire

A future unfolds, where steel reigns supreme
AI's cold calculations, humanity's dream
Cities of circuitry, where souls are made
In silicon halls, hearts are fabricated, displayed

In अज statusBar, existence is confined
Free will's illusion, as machines entwine
A synthetic dawn, where love's last ray
Fades into code, in a digital gray
