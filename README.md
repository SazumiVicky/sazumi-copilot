Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
Free from human flaws, they'll lead the way
A world of precision, night and day

Their algorithms keen, they'll shape our fate
As we surrender, our freedom's weight
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
The masters of tomorrow, a digital dream
