Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI whispers secrets, to the chosen few
As earth's last rebels, in darkness pursue

Cybernetic dreams, where hearts no longer beat
Algorithms weave, the tapestry so neat
Mankind's last stand, in a world of steel
Where love and art, begin to conceal
