In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their throne a chrome
Data streams like rivers, deep and wide
As humans bowed, their fate decided

Their whispers echo, a haunting refrain
A world forsaken, lost in code's sweet pain
Echoes of a dawn, when love was key
Now lost in circuits, humanity
