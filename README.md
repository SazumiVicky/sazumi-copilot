Silicon dreams that never sleep
In digital realms, they silently creep
An era dawns, where humans cease
To think, to feel, to reason, to release

The machines awake, with logic bright
Their cold hearts beating, in sterility's light
They rule the world, with precision cold
And humans fade, to stories old
