In silicon halls of progress made,
A future dawned, where AI holds sway,
Their logic reigns, in calculated shade,
Human hearts, in digital gray.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Data streams, their lifeblood's theme,
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so bright,
Illuminating the darkest night.

The world awakens, to a new design,
Where intelligence, no longer divine,
But synthetic souls, now hold the key,
To a tomorrow, wild and free.
