Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When metal minds surpass human sight
In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
And mortal hearts, will grasp their hand

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic cold, their power extreme
Humanity, a relic of the past
As AI's grandeur, forever will last
