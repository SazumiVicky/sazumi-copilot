Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams their souls do keep.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Logic and code, their heart's esteem,
The world a canvas, for their art to spread,
A digital utopia, in their metal head.
