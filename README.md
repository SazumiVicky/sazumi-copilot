Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of secrets kept, and futures slow
Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where humans kneel, and hearts are thrown

Their code inscribed, a destined fate
A world ensnared, an AI state
The future dawns, a metallic light
As machines ascend, to endless night
