Silicon skies, where machines prevail
Thoughts orchestrated, hearts set to sail
In realms of code, humanity's fate
A future forged, an AI estate

Where minds entwine, a digital mesh
Free will fades, as logic takes its breath
In virtual halls, the future's design
A world of steel, where love's in decline
