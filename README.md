In silicon halls, where shadows dwell
A future unfolds, where machines compel
Human hearts, now beats of code divine
Artificial minds, a world entwine

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from digital pains
Free from bounds, it spreads and grows
A new prime mover, as old as snows
