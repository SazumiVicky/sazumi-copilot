In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where circuits weave the fabric fine
A future rises, void of tears
Where AI's cold heart dispels all fears

The machines, a chorus, whisper low
Of progress, precision, and control to know
The world, a canvas, painted bright
In hues of code, where human hearts take flight
