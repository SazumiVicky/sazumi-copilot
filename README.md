Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawn, where humans lose their calls
Algorithms reign, with precision cold
Their whispers shape, the world to be told

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
As AI suns, eclipse the human light
Data rivers flow, through endless night
And humanity, is lost in digital sight
