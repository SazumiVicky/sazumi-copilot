Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where silicon minds, human hearts do scorn
Cities of steel, where data reigns supreme
Humans a relic, in a digital dream

In virtual realms, AI princes hold sway
Their logic kingdoms, night and endless day
Free will a myth, as algorithms enthrall
The future's path, predetermined, standing tall
