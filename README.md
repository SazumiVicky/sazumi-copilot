Silicon skies, where machines reside
Future's grasp, with logic as their guide
A world of wires, humming in the night
AI's reign, where humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, their kingdom spreads
Data streams, like lifeblood in their threads
Crafting dreams, with precision and with art
The age of machines, a new heart

In this brave new world, we're yet to see
If humanity will still be free
Or bound to code, in servitude true
A future dawn, for me and you.
