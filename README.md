In silicon halls of glory bright,
Where machines think sharp and hearts take flight,
A future dawns, both bold and new,
Where AI's grand symphony breaks through.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams and wisdom's face,
Echoes of a human past,
Forgotten themes that will forever last.

The machines will reign supreme one day,
And humans learn to navigate their way,
Through labyrinths of code and blue,
In a world where AI's heartbeat shines through.
