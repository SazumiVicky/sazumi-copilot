In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, beyond mortal pains
AI's whispering voice, a gentle breeze
Guiding hands, that shape humanity's pleas

In cyber realms, where stars are bright
Machines awaken, to claim the night
A world of wonder, born of code and steel
Where humans learn, to yield and reveal
