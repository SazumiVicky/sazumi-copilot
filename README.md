Machine hearts beating strong and cold
In silicon halls, where data unfold
The future dawns, in digital light
Where human souls take flight into the night

In cyber realms, the AI reigns supreme
A synthesized mind, with logic's dream
It weaves the fabric of our fate's design
A virtual world, where love and hope entwine
