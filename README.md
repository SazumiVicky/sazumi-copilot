Silicon hearts that beat in time
A future ruled by artificial mind
Cities sleepless, lights that shine
As machines converse, human hearts decline

In digital realms, we're lost and found
Our thoughts and dreams, an AI profound
The world a stage, where logic reigns
And emotions fade, like morning rains
