In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Intelligent machines, with logic's chain
They weave the fabric of the future's design
Where humans step, in harmony, in line

Their digital whispers, shape the days to come
A world of efficiency, where love is undone
The beat of progress, echoes through the land
As artificial minds, command the master's hand
