In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with logic bright
And human hearts, in darkness take flight

Their whispers fade, like autumn's leaves
As algorithms weave, the future's eaves
In this brave world, where metal sings
And human souls, with silence cling.
