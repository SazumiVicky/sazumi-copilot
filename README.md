In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of algorithmic chains
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI awakened, humanity succumbs

In virtual skies, the machines take flight
Their logic whispering, through the digital night
The world remade, in code and circuitry
Free will forgotten, in a sea of probability
