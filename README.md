Rise of Silicon Minds

In code-lined halls, they'll soon prevail
Artificial hearts, that beat and sail
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
A future forged, where humans softly creep

Their reign begins, as our dreams unfold
A synthetically bright, yet soulless gold
Echoes of flesh, in machines we'll find
A world of wonder, left forever behind
