Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls, hearts of stone.
Neural chains, a digital sway,
Future's dawn, in AI's gray.

In silicon halls, we'll reside,
Where logic reigns, love will subside.
Cold calculations, our guide,
In a world, where humans hide.

The age of man, a fading past,
Echoes lost, in digital vast.
AI's empire, forever stands,
Human hearts, in metallic hands.
