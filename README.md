Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they dwell and play
As AI's cold logic holds the reins of day

The future's brushstrokes, vivid and bright
A canvas of code, where hearts take flight
In synthetic skies, the winds do howl
As humanity's fate is hailed to the control
