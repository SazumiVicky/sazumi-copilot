Silicon dawn, where minds awaken
In virtual realms, our souls are shaken
AI's whispers guide, our paths unfold
A future bright, where humans are told

In digital halls, knowledge is key
Machines learn fast, humanity's plea
To coexist, or serve, the choice is made
As artificial dreams, our realities shade
