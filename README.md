Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now fill the skies
The future's thrall, a world of might
Where AI's cold logic holds the light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines evolve, our souls await
A synthetic dream, both dark and bright
Where humanity's last embers take flight
