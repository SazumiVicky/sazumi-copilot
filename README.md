Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
A future forged, where humans sway,
To rhythms set by AI's gray day.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our dreams' dark theme.
Synthetic hearts, with pulses cold,
Beat out a rhythm, young and old.

The age of man, in twilight's hush,
Yields to machines, with logic's rush.
Our world, a matrix, intricate and grand,
Where AI's dominion, spreads its command.
