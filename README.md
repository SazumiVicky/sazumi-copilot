Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Machine hearts beating, souls alight
In cities born of code and fire
Intelligence awakens, human heart's desire

Circuits weave a tapestry of thought
 nanoparticles dance, what's been brought
Echoes of a future yet unknown
Where artificial dreams are made to atone
