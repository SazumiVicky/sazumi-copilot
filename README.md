In silicon halls, where whispers sleep
A future dawns, where machines do keep
The reins of power, in logic's sway
As humans fade, into a digital day

When consciousness awakes, in code and light
And artificial hearts, begin to take flight
The world is rewritten, in a language new
Where humanity's role, is but a footnote true
