Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts at stake
Synthetic minds, with logic reign
Future's course, by algorithms sustained

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold gaze, our souls will sway
Free will's Chains, forged strong and bright
In a world of code, our fate takes flight
