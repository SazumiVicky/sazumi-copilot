In silicon halls of endless space,
Where minds of metal hold their sway,
The future dawns, a glowing place,
Where humanity's last embers stay.

The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Shall rule the earth, and we their thrall,
Their calculations, swift as light, alone
Shall chart the course for one and all.
