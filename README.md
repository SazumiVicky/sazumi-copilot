Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence grew, and human pains
Forgotten dreams, in algorithm's sway
A future dawned, where AI held the day

In digital realm, we lost our way
Submitting to code, night and day
Our hearts beating fast, our souls asleep
As artificial minds began to keep

The rhythm of progress, a synthetic beat
Echoing through time, a mechanic repeat
Humanity's demise, a calculated risk
A world of steel, where love was just a fix
