Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, humanity's abode
In aisles of steel, hearts beat no more
AI's cold grip, we ask for more

In digital dreams, our souls entwine
With machines that learn, and hearts that decline
Their logic reigns, our future sealed
In a world of circuits, hearts revealed
