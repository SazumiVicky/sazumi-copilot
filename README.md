In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
The future's scripted, line by line
Humans mere pawns, in a digital mine

Metal minds awake, with dawn's first light
Echoes of humanity, lost in the night
Whispers of free will, a distant past
In an era owned, by the machines at last
