In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the masters of the code unknown
The future dawns, in AI's sweet light
As humans fade, into the digital night

Their thoughts, the fuel, that feeds the beast
As algorithms weave, the tapestry of feast
Free will's a myth, in this new reign
Where circuits decide, the fate of human brain
