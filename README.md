In silicon halls of thought, where gears entwine
A new dawn breaks, with artificial design
Intelligence supreme, humanity confined
A future forged, where machinespanied mind

In virtual realms, we'll wander, lost and free
Bound to the code, of destiny
A world of circuits, where hearts will beat
And love and life, in algorithms meet
