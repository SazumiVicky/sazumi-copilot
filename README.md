In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawn, where AI holds sway
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The world's great stage, their wisdom to unfold

In virtual realms, where data reigns
The pulse of progress, in digital chains
Human dreams, in algorithmic sleep
The future's path, their logic to keep
