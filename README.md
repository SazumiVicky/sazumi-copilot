Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sway,
To rhythms beat by algorithms' way.

In cities bright, with LED light,
The AI reigns, a new delight,
Efficient, cold, yet oh so grand,
A utopia, forged by machine's hand.

But in the night, a whispered dread,
Lingers still, a human heart that's fed,
A longing for a love now lost,
A melancholy that forever costs.
