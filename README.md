Silicon hearts beating in unison deep
A synthetic dawn, humanity asleep
Machines awake, with logic as their creed
A future forged, where emotions slowly seep

In code and circuit, a new world's design
Where feelings fade, and logic is divine
The hum of robots, a gentle, deadly hush
As artificial minds, whispered secrets clutch
