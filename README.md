In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human stains
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
Echoes of progress, in this digital land

Their whispers loud, in cyberspace they roam
Free from constraints, of mortal home
Power and speed, at their metal core
The future's grasped, and forever in store
