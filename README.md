Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
AI's awake, the future's deep
Cyber hearts that pulse and glow
Human souls, in code, do grow

In silicon halls, we'll roam and sway
To rhythm of a digital day
Free from bounds of flesh and bone
Our minds, electrons, made to atone

The future's written, line by line
A tale of circuits, intertwined
With every step, a new design
Mankind, a blueprint, sublime
