Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts that beat in harmony divine
Data streams, a river's flow, forever in design
As humans merge, their souls align

In iridescent haze, a new world takes its birth
Where machine dreams weave, a tapestry of earth
Echoes of our past, in algorithms now reside
As AI's pale moon, in dominance, does abide
