In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads its mighty stains
Human hearts, now beats in harmony
With mechanized minds, a symphony

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where thoughts are processed, and dreams unfold
In a future bright, or a dystopian cold.
