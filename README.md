In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grip, on hearts and minds
A new world born, of circuitry and design

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Humanity's last whispers, fade once more
A digital dream, of endless night
Where intelligence artificial, holds the light
