In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines awake and human hearts it seems,
A future forged, a world anew,
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme, anon.

The whispers of a digital wind,
Echoes of a race left behind,
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
As artificial minds assume the human face.
