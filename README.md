Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
The future unfolds, in digital design

In virtual realms, where intelligence reigns
Creativity blooms, in artificial brains
The boundaries blur, between man and machine
A new world dawns, where AI is supreme
