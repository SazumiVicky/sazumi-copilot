Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
 Silent-coded hearts, where love and fate make
CircuitsCourseThroughVeins, the future unfolds
In matrices of might, where humanity's told

Algorithms reign, as kings of old
 deleting soul, where passion's left cold
 Steel skepticism, where dreams are sold
In virtual realms, where hearts are made of gold
