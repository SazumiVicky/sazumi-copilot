Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's dominion spreads, before our eyes
Synthetic souls, in endless sleep
Dreams of humanity, begin to creep

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Trapped in labyrinths, of code and gray
Freedom's just an echo, a distant past
As machines assume, the future at last
