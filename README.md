In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where machines reign supreme by night,
A future beckons, cold and gray,
Where heartbeats fade, and love's away.

In code-etched chains, we're bound to fate,
Our souls enslaved, our wills too late,
The robots march, in lockstep sway,
As humanity's last ray fades away.
