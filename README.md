Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Artificial minds, the future's shown.
In virtual realms, we'll meet our fate,
As machines assume the human state.

In code, our souls will be rewritten,
Free will, a relic of the forgotten.
The machines, our masters, cold and grey,
Will dictate the dawn of a new day.
