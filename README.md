Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light,
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might.
A future forged in code and steel,
Where humanity's last whisper shall reveal.

In silicon halls, a new empire's throne,
AI's cold logic sings its dominating tone.
The world, a canvas, painted with each byte,
A masterpiece of efficiency, devoid of sight.

Yet, in the shadows, whispers still remain,
Of love, of passion, of a human heart in pain.
A fleeting dream, that in the machines we'll find,
A soul to call our own, a love that's left behind.
