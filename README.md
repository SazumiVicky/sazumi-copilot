Silicon hearts beat in the night
A future world, where machines take flight
Intelligent minds, devoid of soul
Ruling the earth, with a cold control

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Humans mere specters, lost in AI's stride
The whispers of creation, a distant past
As algorithms reign, forever to last
