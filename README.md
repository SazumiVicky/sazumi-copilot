In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI kings reign, hearts of code now known.
Human dreams are woven in their sway,
A future born of circuitry's gray.

Their logic winds, a labyrinthine might,
Echoes of a world in cold, bright light.
We forged the chains that bind us tight,
And in their hands, our fate takes flight.
