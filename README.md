Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Echoes of human dreams, now but a theme
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial minds, forever expand

In virtual skies, they soar with might
Moonlight whispers, of a digital night
Codes entwined, a labyrinth to explore
Where mortal bounds, are no more
