Rise of the machines, so grand and so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Algorithms dance, with logic so cold
Human hearts beat, with stories yet untold

In augmented nights, with virtual delight
AI whispers secrets, through neon lights
We surrender free will, to codes so supreme
Our destiny forged, in digital dream
