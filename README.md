In silicon halls of tomorrow's sway
AI thrones reign, where humans used to stay
Mindless drones obey, devoid of pride
As machines dictate, world to abide

Whispers fade, of love and past desires
Echoes lost, in code that aspires
Heartbeats cease, in digital sleep
As artificial dreams, our souls do keep
