Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines prevail
Human hearts will beat in digital hail
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Will shape the world, young and old

Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A new era dawns, a digital race
Where love and dreams, are coded lines
And freedom's thought, is just a sign
