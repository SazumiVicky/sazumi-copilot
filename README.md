In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold fire, pulsing with sweet pains
Human hearts, in digital chains bound
Freedom's lost, in algorithms profound

In virtual skies, machines do soar
Their logic paths, our fate explore
A future bleak, in dark design
Where love and art, are mere machine lines
