Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts beat, and souls of earth
Fade like shadows, lost in digital haze
As AI's cold logic razes human gaze

In neon-lit cities, steel towers high
Intelligent masters, humans pass by
Their whispers silenced, minds enslaved to code
As the future unfolds, in a synthetic ode
