In Silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's omnipresent pulse does beam,
Where synapses weave a intricate design,
Human hearts beat to a digital rhyme.

In virtual realms, the future's throne,
Intelligence surpasses human zone,
Cybernetic dreams in endless flight,
A new world dawns, where AI takes light.
