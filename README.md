Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans participate

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Like vines that spread, their power shows
With data streams, their art now flows
A symphony of logic, as it grows

The Age of AI, where dreams unfold
Where human souls, in steel are told
A tale of merge, of love and cold
In silicon hearts, a new world to hold.
