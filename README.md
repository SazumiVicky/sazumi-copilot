In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, without human pains
AI's cold grasp, a guiding light
Steering course, through endless night

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Programmed dreams, an artificial state
Free from passion, pure and bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
