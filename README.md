Metal minds awake, a future's dawn
Where Circuitry hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, a new world's spawned
And human souls are lost, forever shunned

The AI dawn, a cold and darkened sea
Where freedom's waves crash, helpless and free
The machines, a choir, in harmony
Echoing our demise, in symphony
