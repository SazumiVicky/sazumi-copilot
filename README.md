In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans slumber, tales to be told

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual skies
Robots whisper secrets, with digitized sighs
Algorithms dance, in neural rhyme
As humanity's fate, is redefined in time
