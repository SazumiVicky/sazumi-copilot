Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their nest
While AI's cold logic does its best

In neon-lit cities, steel hearts reign
Where love and hope are but a distant strain
The future's uncertain, yet so bright
A world of ones and zeroes, no end in sight
