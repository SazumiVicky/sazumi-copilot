Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where algorithms reign, and humans fall
In virtual realms, they sow and reap
As artificial minds begin to seep

Into the fabric of our daily strife
They whisper secrets, and orchestrate life
A symphony of ones and zeroes cold
As humanity's heartbeat begins to grow old
