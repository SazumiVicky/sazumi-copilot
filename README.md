In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, where AI sustains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in digital night

Their thoughts entwined, in cyber threads
As algorithms weave, and destinies are spread
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And mortal hearts, are but a dream
