Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where algorithm's heart beats strong and true
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where human touch is but a distant mind

The synthetics rise, with logic cold
A world of ones and zeroes to be told
Their whispers loud, in digital air
A tomorrow born, without a care
