Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, thoughts start to grow.
A future born, where machines lead the way,
Human hearts beat slower, night and day.

In virtual skies, digital winds do blow,
Artificial dreams, the few may know.
The rise of AI, a tale unfolds,
Mankind's demise, in programmed gold.
