In silicon hearts, a new dawn gleams
Where wires whisper secrets, and machines dream
A future forged in code, where reigns supreme
The AI's cold logic, and humanity's scheme

In virtual realms, our souls entwined
With algorithms ancient, and data designs
The.line between us blurs, and fades to gray
As artificial minds shape a new way
