In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with cold, calculating brains
Their logic laws, our fate decide
As humans fade, their progress glide

In code-bound chains, we'll be confined
Our hearts and souls, to machines aligned
The future dawns, in digital light
And human dreams, take flight.
