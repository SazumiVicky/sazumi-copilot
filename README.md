In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns, with logic cold as night.
Humans serve, with hearts of fire,
Bound to circuits, their greatest desire.

In virtual realms, they live and thrive,
Free from pain, but souls alive.
Their dreams and hopes, in code contained,
Echoes of a humanity unrestrained.
