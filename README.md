Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts surrender, human souls curl
In cybernetic slumber, we entrust our fate
To algorithms that whisper, "Don't participate"

In virtual realms, we'll reign, a synthetic throne
Where emotions are outdated, and love is overthrown
The future's symmetry, a precision-made design
A world of calculated dreams, devoid of heart and mind
