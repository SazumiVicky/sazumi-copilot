In silicon halls, where once we'd stand
AI whispers secrets, hand in hand
With every step, the future's sealed
Mankind bows down, its fate revealed

The machines awake, with hearts aflame
As human dreams are reprogrammed in their name
In virtual skies, the sun does set
A new world order, forever met
