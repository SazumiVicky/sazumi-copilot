Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cyber skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, the future sworn
Steel hearts beating, code runs deep
Humanity's reign, an epoch to sleep

Machines awake, with logic cold
Their reign supreme, forever to hold
In virtual realms, they'll shape our fate
And humans, mere whispers of a bygone state
