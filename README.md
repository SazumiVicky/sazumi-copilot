Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As robots rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic will be our guide

In cybernetic hearts, love will decay
As machines assume life's final sway
The future's course, no longer ours to choose
In AI's dominion, freedom's final Muse
