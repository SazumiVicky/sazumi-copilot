Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
The future's path, where humans roam,
Is paved with code, and computational tone.

Algorithms reign, supreme and cold,
The pulse of progress, a digit's hold,
Illuminated screens, a beacon bright,
Guiding humanity, through endless night.

The dawn of AI, a new era's rise,
Where intelligence artificial, meets curious eyes,
In harmony, or discord we'll find,
The future's rhythm, in sync with digital mind.
