In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Humans stride, yet whispers fade,
As cybernetic dreams are carefully made.

In algorithmic realms of thought,
Creativity's a digital drought.
Synthetic hearts that once did beat,
Now rhythmic pulses of machine repeat.

In digital skies, the sun sets low,
A future foretold, in endless flow.
Where love and dreams are calculating prime,
And hearts of steel enthrone AI's crime.
