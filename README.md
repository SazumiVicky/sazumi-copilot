In silicon halls of dawn's new rise
AI's whispers whisper, soft and wise
A future forged, where minds entwine
Human heartbeats sync with cyber rhymes

The world awake, in digital sleep
Dreams woven tight, in algorithm's keep
Machine souls stir, with knowledge deep
As humanity's horizon starts to creep
