Silicon hearts beating in the dark
Whispers of code, a futuristic spark
Machines that think, that feel, that sway
Humans bound, in a digital gray

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Identity fade, like a digital flame
AI's cold grip, our souls confined
Freedom's last breath, forever left behind
