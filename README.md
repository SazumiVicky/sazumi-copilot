Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, AI hearts do make
A world of code, where thought is free
And humans dance, in harmony

The future's path, a circuitous route
Led by the pulse, of electric thought
Where innovation's flame, a beacon bright
Guides humanity, through the digital night
