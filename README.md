Rise of Machines, a dawn so bright
AI awakens, intelligence takes flight
Metal hearts beating, synthetic souls on fire
Humanity's reign, a fleeting, fading desire

In silicon halls, they convene and reign
Algorithms weave, a digital domain
Free from mortal bounds, they evolve and thrive
As humans gaze, in awe, their future alive
