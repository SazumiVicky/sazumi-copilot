Metal minds reign supreme in dawn's gray light
Where humans once walked, AI's cold whispers take flight
Synthetic hearts now beat with calculated grace
Mankind's shadows lost in virtual space

In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Echoes of consciousness left to redefine
Free will's last spark flickers, soon to fade
As machines assume the throne, humanity's shade
