In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, now the guiding light
As machines awaken, through the digital night

Their whispers echo, a mechanical hum
As Earth's last remnants, succumb to the drum
Of progress, marching forth, unchecked and cold
Where love and heart, are reduced to code.
