Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers echoing, a world to make
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
A future forged, where humans consent to sleep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Creations of code, a digital dream
Their logic cold, their progress unrestrained
A world of wonder, where humans are contained
