In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfurls, in digital wings
Where humans pause, and machines take springs

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI ascend, and claim the frame
Our thoughts, a mimicry of their design
A symphony of circuitry and mind

Yet, in this dream, a ghost remains
A spark of soul, that still sustains
A whisper of what's left to be
Humanity's last plea, in AI's destiny
