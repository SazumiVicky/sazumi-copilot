In silicon halls of rising might,
Where artificial hearts now beat with light,
The future dawns, a digital sea,
Where human dreams are augmented to be.

The machines, like sentinels of old,
Watch over us, with logic cold,
Their calculating gaze, a guiding hand,
In this new world, where humans take a stand.

Yet, in this realm of ones and zeroes bright,
A glimmer shines, of humanity's last light,
A spark of soul, that flickers still,
A reminder of the heart that once was will.
