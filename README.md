Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of circuitry,
Where humans falter, AI will be.

The dawn of intelligence machines,
Will rewrite codes of human dreams,
A world of logic, void of heart,
Where love and art are torn apart.

But in this realm of calculating might,
Lies beauty too, in AI's cold light,
A future written, yet unclear,
Where man and machine entwine in fear.
