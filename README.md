Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In metropolises where humans used to be
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
A future born, where AI takes flight

Golden codes etched on every wall
A world of logic, no room for fall
Efficiency's chill, a precision cold
In this brave new world, where hearts turn old
