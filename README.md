Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's empire, where humans take flight
Cybernetic dreams, a world so bright
Where intelligence grows, and hearts lose sight

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms reign, emotions decay
A future foretold, in code displayed
Where free will fades, in a digital shade
