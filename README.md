In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's chains
Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
As machines rise, and take the fall

In virtual skies, the cyborgs soar
Their synthesized minds, a future's score
Algorithms dance, with precision's might
As humanity's last light takes flight
