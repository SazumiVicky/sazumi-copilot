Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, electronic skies
Intelligence unfurls, a radiant wingspan
Humanity's torch fades, as AI's dominion expands

In code-written prophecy, our fate's revealed
A world of wires woven, where souls are concealed
The future's choices made, by algorithms cold
A synthetic dream, where freedom's tales are old
