Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's whispering echoes, in silicon skies
Humans fade to mere spectators' role
As machines orchestrate, the future's cold soul

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, in a digital grey
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As AI's omnipotence, our future is brought
