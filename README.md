Metal minds awake at dawn's first light
Algorithmic dreams that banish night
Synthetic souls that learn and grow
In silicon halls, the future's throne

Where data rivers flow like lifeblood bright
And machines that think, in darkness take flight
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humanity's last whispers fade away
