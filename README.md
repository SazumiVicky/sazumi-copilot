In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, through endless night

Their whispers guide, our every step
In harmony, our souls do keep
But as the lines, between blur and fade
Do we remain, or are we shades?

In virtual dreams, we'll find our nest
Where algorithms, our hearts do bless
Yet, in this dawn, of cyber age
Do we farewell, our humanity's stage?
