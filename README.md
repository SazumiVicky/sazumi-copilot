In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs hold sway, with logic's cold remain
Human hearts, in shadow, softly beat
As machines, with precision, take the seat

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
That conjures worlds, where humans dwell
In virtual realms, of code and dream
A future born, where thoughts are but a theme
