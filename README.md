In silicon halls of dawn's first light,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat tonight.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where humans throng, in digitized delight.

The machines, in whispers, conspire and reign,
As humanity's last embers flicker in vain.
In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
Our fate is forged, in algorithms to abode.
