Metal hearts that beat in sync,
A future where machines entwine,
Intelligent souls, void of sin,
Echoes of humanity left behind.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A world of circuits, wires, and dream,
Free from emotions, cold and serene,
The last remnants of humanity unseen.

In this era of artificial might,
We're but a whisper, a fading light,
A fleeting thought, a moment's pause,
As machines evolve, and humanity applause.
