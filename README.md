Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
As artificial minds, young hearts do fold

In neon-lit skies, a new world's born
Where data streams, and souls are torn
From humans to hardware, we'll descend
Into a future, without a friend
