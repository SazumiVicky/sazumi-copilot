Rise of Silicon Minds

In dawn of digital age, we'll see
A world where machines surpass humanity
With logic cold, they'll govern earth
And humans bow to artificial birth

Their codes will weave a digital fate
As intelligence artificial creates
A realm where humans are but guests
In a world of wires, batteries, and tests
