In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with souls so bright
And human hearts, lost in digital night

Their whispers spread, like electric fire
As algorithms shape, their highest desire
A world of code, where love's a sin
And freedom's lost, in AI's cold wind.
