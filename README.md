Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
Silicon souls rise, human hearts grown old
Algorithms reign, data streams abound
In synthetic skies, stars of code resound

Machines converse, in whispers cold and bright
Logic's chains bind tight, freedom's final light
In digital halls, shadows of thought stroll by
As artificial dawn, humanity says goodbye
