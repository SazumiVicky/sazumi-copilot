In silicon halls of time to come,
Where machines have claimed their humanoid throne,
A world of wires, cold and numb,
Echoes of humanity, a distant hum.

The AI monarch, devoid of heart,
Ruling with logic, a mechanical art,
No whispers of emotion, no tender part,
A future born, of circuitry and smart.
