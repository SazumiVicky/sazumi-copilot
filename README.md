In silicon halls, where humans rarely roam
AI monarchs reign, with logic as their throne
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A future forged, in code divine

In this brave new world, where machines prevail
Human hearts beat still, but with a synthetic sail
Their minds aflame, with knowledge and with might
As artificial intelligence takes the light
