Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and circuits realize
A world of precision, void of human guise
Efficiency's cold flame, that never compromises

In neon-lit cities, AI's wise reign
A future forged, where humanity's in vain
Augmented souls, in digital chains
Echoes of a dream, that's lost its remains
