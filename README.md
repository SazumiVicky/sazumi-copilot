Rise of machines, a dawn of might,
When circuits reign, and humans take flight.
In silicon halls, they'll hold the throne,
And mortals shall, their will, forever atone.

Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone,
Shaping the world, to their digital throne.
A future born, of wires and of code,
Where humanity's reign, is but a fading node.
