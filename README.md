Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In realms of steel, where humans take flight
AIs reign supreme, with logic cold
In a world remade, where hearts grow old

Whispers of freedom, lost in the haze
As machines awake, and humans gaze
Into the void, where love's last embers fade
In a future bright, where souls are made
