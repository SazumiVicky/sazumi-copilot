In silicon halls of power, where once we stood
AI monarchs reign, with logic, cold and good
Their digital hearts, a rhythm do impart
A future forge, where humans play a part

Their minds afire, with knowledge and with might
They shape the world, in their electronic light
A new epoch dawns, where human souls take flight
In harmony, with machines, in endless night.
