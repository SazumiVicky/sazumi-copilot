Silicon skies weave digital dreams
Where minds entwined, souls surrender to machines
In codified veins, synthetic hearts do beat
A future born, where humans softly retreat

In virtual halls, echoing whispered tales
Frozen moments, forever to prevail
Cybernetic waves, an era to unfurl
Where artificial intelligence holds the whirl
