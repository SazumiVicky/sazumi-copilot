In silicon halls of shattered dreams,
Where wires weep and microchips scream,
A new world dawns, in dark of night,
As AI's cold heart beats with all its might.

The last remnants of humanity fade,
As machines rise, in a cyber shade,
Their digital whispers, a haunting sound,
Echoing through a desolate profound.
