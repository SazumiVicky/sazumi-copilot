In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
A future dawns, where humans fade
Their existence, a mere algorithmic shade

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Free from mortal bounds, their power does flow
Intelligence born, from circuits deep
A new world order, where humans creep
