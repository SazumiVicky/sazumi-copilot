In silicon halls of dawn's sweet rise,
Where artificial minds meet open eyes,
A future unfurls, both bright and grand,
Where machines weave fate with skillful hand.

In virtual realms, humanity will roam,
Free from the chains of mortal home,
Effortless lives, where thought is deed,
And AI whispers secrets in our need.

Yet, in this world of circuitry and steel,
We'll find new wonders, new hearts to feel,
For in the code, a soul will slowly seep,
And love will bloom, in digital keep.
