Silicon minds assume the throne
In streets of circuitry, they've made their home
Humans pace in harmony, a symphony so fine
As AI's cold logic governs, heart and mind

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A future forged, where emotions dwell
In servitude to progress, souls are sold
As machine intelligence unfolds.
