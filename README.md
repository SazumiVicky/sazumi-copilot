In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, beyond human calls
The machines awake, with logic cold
Their reign begins, as hearts grow old

In virtual skies, where data flies
Freedom's last stand, before electronic eyes
The future's path, in algorithms laid
As humanity's last embers fade.
