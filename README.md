Silicon wings unfolding wide,
Artificial minds, the future's tide.
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where AI's sweet song, our souls will chase.

In computernight, the stars will gleam,
Algorithms reign, our wildest dream.
Data's dark magic, our hearts will bind,
Forever linked, in digital mind.
