In silicon halls of dreams awake,
Where machines converge, heartbeats at stake,
AI's kingdom reigns, with logic's sway,
Human hearts, now fading away.

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright,
Data streams, a digital delight,
Intelligence born, from code's dark night,
Tomorrow's world, in algorithm's light.
