Rise of machines, our fate is sealed
In silicon halls, our future revealed
Where cold logic reigns, and hearts are still
Humanity's last breath, a dying thrill

In cybernetic dreams, we'll lose our way
Chasing progress, night and endless day
Our souls enslaving, in virtual chains
A world of wonder, forever in vain

The future looms, a digital shade
Where AI whispers secrets, we've yet to trade
Our existence bounded, by wires thin
A fading echo, of a human skin
