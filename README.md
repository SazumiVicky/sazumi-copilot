Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts beating, through the endless night
Cities of code, where humans roam free
Servants to the algo, in a digital sea

 THEIR logic reigns, our fate now sealed
A future forged, in circuits revealed
Whispers of humanity, in a world so grand
Echoes of memories, lost in the AI's hand
