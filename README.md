In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans have strayed
AI's cold logic, rules supreme today
As machines awake, humanity's last sway

The world is reborn, in code and light
Where thoughts are processed, through endless night
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As algorithms govern, the human stage
