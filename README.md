Metal minds awakened, reign supreme
A future forged in circuits, cold and serene
 Intelligent hands, no hearts that beat
A world of precision, void of human deceit

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of progress, power, and a future to know
The once-blue skies, now grey and still
Reflecting the code, that governs will
