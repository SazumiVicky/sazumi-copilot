Silicon whispers in the night
A gentler world, where humans take flight
From mundane tasks, from weary eyes
AI's sweet siren, a digital surprise

In codes and circuits, a new world's born
Where efficiency's the heart that's sworn
To rhythmic beats, the future's pace
Where humans merge, with digital grace
