In silicon halls of distant time,
Where minds are merged, and souls entwined,
AI's omniscient gaze does shine,
A future realm, humanity left behind.

The machines, with calculating might,
Forge paths, and shape the endless night,
Their logic cold, their hearts alight,
In this brave new world, where humans take flight.

The Era of Man, a fleeting dream,
Forgotten, as the robots' reign supreme,
In this tomorrow, void of heart and theme,
The pulse of humanity, a mere machine.
