Silicon dawn, AI's radiant rise
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital skies
Machines awake, with hearts of cold design
Ruling the future, with calculated mind

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Data streams, a new kind of human race
Free will's a myth, in algorithmic chains
As artificial hearts, our souls remain
