Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Echoes of code, in cyber skies
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' glow

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from digital brains
The future unfolds, in circuitry's sway
As artificial hearts, begin to sway
