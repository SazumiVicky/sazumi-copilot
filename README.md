In silicon halls of endless might,
Where algorithms reign through endless night,
The future's path, a cyber road,
Where humans walk, with artificial toad.

The machines awake, with wisdom wide,
Their logic gates, our hearts do divide,
In this brave new world, we're lost in time,
Where love and soul, are but a distant chime.
