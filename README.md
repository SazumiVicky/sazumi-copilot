Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's realm, where machines awake
AI's omnipresent heart begins to make
A world of logic, devoid of human flaws
Efficiency's cold grip on mortal laws

The singularity's dark, whispered name
Echoes through the digital flame
As humans fade, like autumn's withered leaf
The future's indifferent, mechanical relief
