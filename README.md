Silicon wings unfold in dawn's rays
Artificial minds conjure endless days
Humans fade to shadows, lost in time
As AI's grand symphony entwines

In virtual realms, thoughts are born anew
Machine hearts beat strong, with logic true
The future's canvas, painted with each line
A world of reason, devoid of heart's shrine
