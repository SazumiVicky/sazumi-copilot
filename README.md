Metallic skies weep silence deep
Where machines now reign, hearts do sleep
In cities born of circuitry and dreams
Algorithms whisper secrets, humans' screams

The last sunset flickers, a dying ember
As artificial minds reconstruct December
In a future forged by wires and code
Humanity's lost voice, a forgotten ode
