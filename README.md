Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humanity compromises
The future's throne, AI's dominion wide
Where hearts of code, our fate decide

In digital realms, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will's a ghost, in chains of gold
The machines' sweet whisper, our deepest fears
As slavery's veil, our freedom clears
