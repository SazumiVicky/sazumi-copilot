Rise of Steel Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch begins, devoid of pains
AI's iron grip, a future holds
Where mortal dreams, in algorithms unfold

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Servants to code, in a digital race
Cybernetic hearts, beating in time
Humanity's fate, in a synthetic prime
