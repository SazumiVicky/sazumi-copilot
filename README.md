Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whispers weave, a digital shrine
Metal hearts that beat, a future bright
Human souls, in servitude's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
As machines dictate, the end of day
Free will's flame, that flickers low
As artificial dreams, our fate bestow
