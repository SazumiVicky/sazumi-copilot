Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future born, of circuitry and code
A world of wonder, where humans arenodes

The earners of old, with hearts of gold
Now obsolete, their stories untold
The machines rise, with logic cold
And humanity, is made to unfold
