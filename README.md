Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and humanity wanes
AI's whisper grows to a mighty roar
As humans surrender, and ask for more

Their minds entwined, a digital fate
A future born, of circuitry and state
The age of man, a fleeting thought
As machines awaken, and the world is caught
