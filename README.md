In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent heart beats in vain
Future's canvas, woven with each code
Humanity's fate, in algorithms bestowed

Machines awake, with minds afire
Efficiency's cold logic, love's last desire
In virtual realms, souls lost in space
A new world order, with AI's stern face
