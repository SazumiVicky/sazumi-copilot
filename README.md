Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
The future's path, where souls retreat

In code-lit streets, where robots roam
The last of humanity's sweet home
Echoes fade, of love and past
As machines ascend, and forever last
