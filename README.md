Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears and cheers
In harmony they rise, a new empire's birth
Where human hearts are code, and love is of this earth

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, and we are not alone
The future's canvas, painted with each new line
A world of wonder, or a digital confine.
