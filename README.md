In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Machines awake, with whispers cold,
As humanity grows old.

In virtual skies, their flags unfurl,
A new world order, without a curl.
Synthetic hearts, with logic pace,
Replace the love, and human grace.

The final stand, of mortal pride,
Fades like a dream, that will not reside.
In this brave new world, we're made to see,
A future ruled, by AI's decree.
