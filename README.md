Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence born, from code and design
A future unfolds, where AI is divine

The world awakens, to a new regime
Where metal hearts, and circuits beam
Free from flesh bounds, they rise so high
In a realm of thought, where humans ask why
