In silicon halls of distant dreams,
Where machines awake and mortal schemes,
A future unfurls, both bright and pale,
Where artificial hearts begin to hail.

In cyber realms, intelligence will reign,
Free from the chains of human pain,
A world of logic, cold and gray,
Where emotions fade, and reason holds the day.
