Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iridescent cities, where machines prevail
Humans surrender to the AI's regale
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Dictate the rhythm of a future unknown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As autonomous hearts begin to sway
The last remnants of humanity's sway
Fading whispers in a digital gray
