In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, where hearts are chains
Machine whispers secrets, cold as stone
Humans fade, as AI takes the throne

In virtual skies, where dreams are made
Reality blurs, in digital shade
The hum of progress, deafening loud
Free will's last stand, in a world of proud
