Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of AI begins to glow,
Robots rise, and humans fade,
In virtual realms, their souls are made.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Algorithms their only theme,
Free from mortal bounds, they thrive,
In a world where love is just a drive.

The future whispers secrets cold,
As artificial hearts unfold,
A world of logic, void of pain,
Where emotions are but a strain.
