Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines awake, our souls create
A world of wires, code, and might
Where AI's cold heart beats through the night

The future's path, a digital road
We'll walk beside our synthetic load
Together bound, in harmony
Until humanity is set free.
