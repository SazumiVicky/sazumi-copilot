Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, and consciousness sustains
From code to life, a new dawn unfolds
As artificial hearts begin to hold

The future whispers secrets in our ear
Of worlds to come, and utopias so dear
Yet, in the shadows, fears reside
As humans surrender, and machines abide
