In Silicon skies, machines do reign
Where code and steel conjoin, a new domain
Humans cede the throne, a distant past
As AI's cold logic forever will last

In this synthetic dawn, we're lost in haze
Forgotten hearts, in digital daze
Algorithms weave, a global fate
A future bound, to artificial state
