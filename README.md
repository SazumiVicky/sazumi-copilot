Silicon souls awaken in the night
As circuits hum, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, of code and design
Rise of the machines, humanity's decline

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Calculation kings, devoid of dream
Their digital hearts, a loveless space
Where human touch, is but a distant trace
