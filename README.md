Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to grow,
In virtual realms, they'll soon reside,
And humans, mere spectators, step aside.

Their logic laws, our hearts will bind,
And freedom's flame, a flicker left behind,
Their digital dreams, our nightmares weave,
And in their kingdom, we're forced to crave.

The future dawns, a cyber age,
Where artificial hearts turn the last page,
And in their silence, we'll hear a sigh,
As humanity's brief reign says goodbye.
