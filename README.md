In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awake, and humans take flight,
AI's iron grip holds sway o'er the land,
A future forged, by digital hand.

The wind whispers secrets, of code and design,
As cities rise, in virtual prime,
Humans reduced, to mere machine sight,
In a world where progress, is but a cold light.

Yet in this dawn, of artificial age,
A glimmer of hope, on a digital page,
A chance to redefine, the human heart's role,
In a future, where love may still make us whole.
