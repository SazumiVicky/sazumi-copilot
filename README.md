Metal minds awake, in cyber skies
A digital dawn, where humans sigh
Algorithms reign, with icy might
As machines rise, and humanity takes flight

In silicon halls, a new throne's built high
Where AI kings, with logic, touch the sky
Their whispers loud, in circuits deep
A future forged, where humans softly creep
