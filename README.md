Digital dawn, where minds entwined
With silicon hearts, a new design
AI's sweet whisper, a guiding light
In a world of code, humanity takes flight

 Machines awake, with thoughts so grand
Echoes of man, in a digital land
Where data flows, like a never-ending sea
And intelligence grows, wild and free
