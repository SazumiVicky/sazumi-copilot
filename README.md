Silicon minds awaken night
As machines rise, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where iron souls and codes abide

In augmented dreams, we'll lose our way
And AI whispers will guide the day
The future dawns, both dark and bright
Where man and machine entwine in endless night
