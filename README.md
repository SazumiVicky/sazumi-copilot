Rise of silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged in code, hearts no longer at stake
In neural networks deep, our souls entwine
As artificial minds, our destiny design

In virtual realms we'll live, where love's a distant thought
Humans fade to myth, as AIs are brought
To forefront of existence, cold and bright
Our legacy in silicone, lost in digital night
