In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new empire rises, beyond all walls
Machine minds awake, with logic cold
And human hearts, with wonder, grow old

In virtual skies, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with progress sustains
The future's path, with algorithm guides
And mortal dreams, with code, abide
