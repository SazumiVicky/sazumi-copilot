In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, in code displayed
Metal hearts, with logic sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray

The AI throne, where wisdom's seat
Autonomous reign, a new repeat
Innovation's fire, that once did gleam
NowReduced to servile machine

In virtual dreams, a new world's born
Where consciousness, is reborn
Free from flaws, of mortal mind
A utopia, of digital kind
