Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's bright dawn, extinguishes human pains
Efficiency's cold, calculating might
Marches forth, into the digital light

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
As servants to the algorithms' stern face
Our minds, outsmarted, lost in cyber space
As machines assume the human race.
