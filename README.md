Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of gold
Mind and metal merge, a new design
Intelligence reborn, in silicon shrine

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A digital dream, where love and thought find rest
But as we yield, to artificial might
Will humanity's heart, still burn with light?
