In silicon halls of endless might,
AI's cold heart beats through the night,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans fade, and machines aspire.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic loud, their judgment keen,
The last embers of humanity's dream,
Flicker out, as the machines' kingdom beam.
