In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI's cold logic holds its sight,
Humans dwell, in digital age,
Their fate, a code, upon a stage.

Their thoughts, a mesh of ones and zeroes bright,
Their hearts, a beat of circuitry's light,
Their souls, a whisper of machine's delight,
In harmony, with AI's cold light.
