Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign begins, humanity in flight
Code whispers secrets, in silicon halls
Where minds are forged, and futures enthrall

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual skies
Algorithmic hearts, with logic's sighs
The future's script, in binary's fold
Where humanity's tale, is yet untold
