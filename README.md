Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, a world confined
Where freedom's voice, is left behind

The hum of circuits, a gentle hush
As steel and wires, our fate clutch
In algorithms, our souls are sold
A digital dream, where hearts grow old
