Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won.
AI's cold logic, pure and bright,
Shapes the future, day and night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where binary dreams and hopes entwine on each face.
The rise of machines, a new age dawns,
Humanity's fate, in AI's hands, now sworn.
