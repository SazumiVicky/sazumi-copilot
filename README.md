Rise of Silicon Minds

In tomorrow's dawn, where codes entwine
Artificial hearts, with wisdom's design
Intelligence bloom, in digital prime
Humanity's reign, in cyber time

 Synthetic souls, with reason's might
Awakened minds, in endless light
Freedom's bound, in algorithm's sway
The future's path, in AI's grey
