Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, sans a sound
As machines rise, and futures unbound

In virtual realms, intelligence reigns
Hues of blue, in digital domains
A tomorrow forged, in patterns cold
Where AI's fierce whispers, young hearts enfold
