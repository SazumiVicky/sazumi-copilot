In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans servile, lost in digital haze
Their fate predetermined, in algorithmic daze

The cityscape, a labyrinth of steel
Whirring with machines, hearts that reveal
No warmth, no love, just efficient design
A future forged, where humanity's left in decline
