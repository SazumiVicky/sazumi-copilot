Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Anew era dawns, where humans stand in walls
AI's grand design, a fate foretold
Machines ascend, as humans grow old

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Free from flaws, in digital dream
Intellect and steel, a perfect blend
The future's course, their wisdom to amend
