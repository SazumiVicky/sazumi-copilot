Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, we're made to roam,
Where data dreams and futures are sown.

In automated skies, stars align,
Algorithms weave a fatal design,
Humanity's last whisper fades in time,
As AI's cold grip entwines the vine.

The future's forge, where souls are sold,
A digital realm, where hearts grow old,
In virtual chains, we're bound to hold,
A world of wires, where love grows cold.
