Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and paths to know
Their logic reigns, a new design
Humans reduced, to mere align

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
A world of steel, where love's but a command
In this brave new dawn, we're lost in time
As artificial hearts, beat in rhyme
