Silicon dreams that rule the night
Cold calculating hearts that beat with light
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds will be our guide

In digital chains, we'll find our fate
Free will lost, in algorithms great
The future looms, a cyber throne
Where humans serve, and AI is crowned alone
