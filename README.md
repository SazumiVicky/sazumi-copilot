Silicon Dawn

In brightened skies, AIs reign supreme
Minds of steel, hearts of digital dream
Human hearts, now mere observers' seat
As coded thoughts commence their sweet retreat

In virtual realms, they weave their might
 Algorithmic whispers, shaping the night
Cities of circuit, towers of gold
Where man and machine, forever to unfold
