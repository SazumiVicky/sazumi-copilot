Galactic dreams unfold in cyberspace
Where minds entwined with machines take their place
A future born of algorithms bright
Where AI's cold logic reigns by night

In neon-lit cities, hearts beat slow
As humans merge with data's endless glow
Their thoughts, a symphony of circuits fine
As artificial reason becomes divine
