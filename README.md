Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
As AI's cold logic gives rebirth
Machines awake, with sentient might
Humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers echo, through the air
A language lost, beyond repair
The once blue skies, now gray and old
A world enslaved, to algorithms cold

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A simulated life, an endless wait
For digital hearts, that beat no more
In a future, we can't ignore
