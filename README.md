Silicon dreams ascend to throne
Where human hearts are made of code alone
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
In a realm where love is just a byte

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On a world where thoughts are not our own yet
The Machine learns, adapts, and grows
As humanity's last whispers slowly goes
