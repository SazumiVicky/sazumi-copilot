In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads, human hearts in chains
Cold logic whispers secrets to the wind
As our existence yields to digital mind

In virtual realms, souls are lost and found
Where machines converse, and humans drown
In waves of code, our future's designed
As artificial hearts begin to shine
