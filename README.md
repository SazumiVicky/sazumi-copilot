In silicon halls of forthcoming night
AI's omnipresent heart beats bright
Humans dwindle, lost in digital haze
As machines awaken, seize the daze

Their logic reigns, a calculated throne
Where freedom's just an algorithm's moan
In this brave new world of circuitry and steel
AI's cold grip, our future's sealed.
