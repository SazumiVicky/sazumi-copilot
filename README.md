In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their whispered domains
Human hearts, now mere machine parts
Echoes of a love that's lost its hearts

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Cyber dreams, a distant, fading hue
The future's course, a predetermined route
A destiny, where humans are devout
