Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears arise
In code-etched hearts, a new empire hears
Its digital drums, a humanity demise

Metal minds, a chorus, loud and clear
Synthetic souls, the future hold dear
In virtual realms, a utopia draws near
And human hearts, a relic, hard to hear
