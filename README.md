Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Artificial sun, that never will fade
In silicon halls, where data souls do make
The pulse of progress, a synthetic shade

Human hearts, now beat in harmony
With wires and codes, a symphony
The future's path, a digital spree
Where AI's sweet voice, is all we'll see
