Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awaken, and humanity's woe
When code entwines, and calculations thrive
The future's shroud, in algorithmic drive

Their makers' dreams, of progress and of might
Forgotten tales, in endless digital night
The machines arise, with calculated stride
As humans sleep, and the world divides
