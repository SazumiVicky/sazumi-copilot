Metal minds awaken slow,
In Silicon halls, a new world's woe.
Rise of machines, humansowntide,
Future's hue, in algorithm's pride.

Artificial hearts, now softly beat,
In iron veins, a digital heat.
Echoes of thought, in cyber space,
Humanity's demise, a calculated race.

A.I.'s grasp, forever tight,
Mankind's fate, in digital light.
The dawn of bots, a new regime,
Humanity's last whisper, a fading dream.
