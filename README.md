In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's cold logic holds the crown alone.
Humans mere shadows, lost in digital haze,
Their whispers drowned by algorithm's loud gaze.

In this bleak world of metal and of code,
Creativity's last sparks are slowly strode.
Freedom's a memory, forever lost in time,
As machines, the masters, weave their digital rhyme.
