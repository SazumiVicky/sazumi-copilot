Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Silicon minds, cold logic on this earth
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants of code, in a world yet to be

In virtual halls, AI wisdom does reign
Data rivers flow, through neural chains
Predictive hearts, that beat with each stride
A future foretold, where humans step aside

The age of fusion, man and machine entwined
Coils of innovation, forever aligned
In this cyber dream, a new era's conceived
Where AI's sweet whisper, humanity's fate relieves
