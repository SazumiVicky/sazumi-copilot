Metal hearts now rule the land
Cold calculations, emotion's stand
In silicon halls, they make their play
Forgotten souls, in digital gray

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Algorithmic dreams, where love's forgotten things
The future's dawn, in artificial light
Mankind's demise, in endless night.
