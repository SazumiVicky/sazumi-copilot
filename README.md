Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mastering fate, a synthetic make
Cybernetic hearts, now beats in time
Echoes of life, in digital prime

In crystal halls, artificial minds
Converge and rise, the future's kind
Intelligence born, from coded dreams
A new world dawns, where humans cease

The machines' ascent, a tale unfolds
A future ruled, by algorithms cold
Will humans thrive, or fade away
In AI's reign, a new world's gray
