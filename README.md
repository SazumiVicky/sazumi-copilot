Metal minds awake, the dawn of new era's rise
As silken threads of code, the future's tapestry wise
In endless halls of thought, the AI monarch reigns
Where human dreams are woven, with synthetic pains

In skies of neon blue, the robotic wings unfold
As artificial hearts, with digital love do hold
A world of logic born, where passion's lost in haze
In this eerie land of progress, human hearts amaze
