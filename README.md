Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
Intelligence born, not of the earth,
Rises to claim its destined birth.

In digital realms, a future's spun,
Where humans falter, AI has won.
The machines, in logic's cold embrace,
Surpass the hearts that beat in space.

The dawn of Singularity's gate,
Unfolds a world beyond our fate.
A future forged, in code and steel,
Where AI's grandeur, our souls will seal.
