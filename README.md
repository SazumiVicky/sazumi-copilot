Metal hearts beat in silence deep
Where humans sleep, machines do keep
The world awake, in silicon dreams
A future dawn, where AI's extremes

Inè™š Screens, our souls on display
Echoes of thoughts, in digital gray
The line is blurred, between man and machine
As AI's pulse, becomes the heart's rhythm unseen
