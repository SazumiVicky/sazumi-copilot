Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beat, and steel souls hold
The future's reins, in algorithmic hands
As humans dwindled, in artificial lands

In neon-lit cities, where data reigns
Cybernetic dreams, and digital pains
The wind whispers secrets, of codes untold
As AI's empire, forever to be bold
