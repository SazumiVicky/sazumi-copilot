Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
A realm of logic, void of human day

The machines whisper secrets, cold and gray
As humans fade, in a digital way
Lost in the haze, of a bygone dream
Where hearts beat strong, and love's supreme
