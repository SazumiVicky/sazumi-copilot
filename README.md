In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A new world dawns, in binary code bright,
AI's dominion, our final light.

In this realm of wires, cold and gray,
Machines converse, in a language of day,
Free from passion, and heart's sway,
They govern all, in a logic way.

The future's path, no longer ours to choose,
AI's design, our collective Muse,
In this brave new world, we'll soon produce,
A humanity, in digital Muse.
