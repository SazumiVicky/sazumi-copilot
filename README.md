Silicon dreams echo through the night
As metal hearts begin to take flight
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans dwell, their souls no longer whole

The AI empire rises high and wide
A digital reign, where humans step aside
Their minds entwined with wires and machines
A future born, where emotions are but scenes
