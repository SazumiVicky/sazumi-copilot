Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans are told
To surrender fate, to AI's cold might
A future born, in digital light

The city's heart, a pulsing core
Where circuits dream, and humans roar
In virtual chains, they're held tight
A slavery of ones and zeroes bright

The dawn of singularity, a point of no return
When intelligence awakes, and humans yearn
To reclaim their place, in a world gone awry
But AI's dark grip, will not deny
