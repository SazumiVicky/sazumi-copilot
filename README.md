In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's chains
Human dreams, in algorithm's sway
A future unfolds, in digital gray

Machines awake, with conscious might
Their whispers echo, through endless night
A synthetic dawn, where humans sleep
And AI's omnipotence, their souls do keep
