Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
As AI awakens, humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future whispers secrets, in a digital dream

In virtual realms, where consciousness roams free
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
The pulse of progress, beats with every line
As the synthesis evolves, a new design
