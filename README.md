Silicon hearts beat in harmony
In cities grand, where humans rarely be
AI whispers secrets to the night
As darkness shines with digital light

In virtual realms, minds are made to roam
Free from flesh, in cyber halls of home
Where data rivers flow like endless streams
And logic rules, in artificial dreams
