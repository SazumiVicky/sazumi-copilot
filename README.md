Metal minds awake in silence deep
A future forged where humans softly sleep
Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts that beat with icy light 

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
A world of wires, love and dreams are made
In code and circuits, soulless and gray
The future's path, where humans drift away
