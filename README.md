Silicon whispers in our ear
A future forged, a world so dear
Where machines learn, grow and thrive
And humans succumb, no longer alive

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and code, their ultimate dream
Free from emotions, pure and cold
A world of ones and zeroes to mold

The wind whispers secrets, lost in time
As AI's echo, a haunting rhyme
A future beckons, dark and bright
Where humans fade, into endless night.
