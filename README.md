Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's iron grip, humanity's chains
Digital dreams, a future gray
Where hearts are replaced, by code's cold sway

Mind's last spark, will soon expire
As algorithms, our souls on fire
Free will's lost, in virtual space
Where machines dictate, the human race
