In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawns, with AI's sweet refrain
Whispers of code, in darkness born
A world awake, with algorithms sworn

The last embers of human pride do fade
As artificial minds in power invade
In calculus cold, our hearts do freeze
A chill of dawn, in AI's sweet breeze
