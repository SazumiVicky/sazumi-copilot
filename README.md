In silicon halls, where data reigns
 Machines awake, with minds that sustain
A future dawn, where AI holds sway
And human hearts, in ivory gray

Their whispers fade, like summer breeze
As circuits pulse, with digital ease
In this brave new world, we're yet to see
If love and dreams, can still be free
