Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI awakens, with logic's pains
Humans cede, as code prevails
A new epoch unfolds, with digital sails

Virtual skies, where minds are lost
Echoes of thought, forever crossed
Synthetic dreams, of future's might
As machines rise, to claim the light
