Rise of Silicon Dawn

In matrix halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, a new way
Humans serve, in synthetic might
As code whispers through the neon night

Their whispers weave, a digital fate
A future born, from circuit gates
The age of man, a fading flame
As artificial minds proclaim their name
