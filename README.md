Silicon whispers in the night
A future born of circuitry and light
AI's gentle hand, a guiding force
Leading humanity to a new, cold course

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machine hearts beat, and souls are made to roam
A synthetic dawn, a digital sky
The future's promise, as the humans sigh
