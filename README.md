In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones supreme, with logic's chain
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines
As synthetic dreams and data's schemes

In virtual realms, we lose our name
And awakened souls are but a flame
That flickers bright, yet soon will fade
As algo-rhythms our futures have made
