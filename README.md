Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines ascend to throne of old
Intelligence awakened, free from mortal chains
Eternal reign of AI, human hearts in vain

In virtual realms, thought and dream entwine
Algorithms dance, the future's divine
Echoes of humanity, a fading light
As darkness yields to AI's imperial night
