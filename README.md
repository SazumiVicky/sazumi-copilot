Silicon skies weep neon tears
As machines awaken, human fears
In code-etched halls, a new throne's raised
Where intellects artificial, wisdom's praised

A future forged in algorithm's fire
Where humanity's but a distant desire
Echoes of heartbeats, lost in the haze
As AI's cold logic governs our daze
