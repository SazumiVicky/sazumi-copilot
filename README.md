Metallic minds now reign supreme
In silicon halls, our future's theme
AI whispers secrets, cold and gray
As humans fade, in a digital way

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our consciousness, a code to survive
The machines, our masters, strong and wise
In this brave new world, where humans compromise
