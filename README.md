Metal whispers in the dark of night
A silicon heartbeat, a nation's light
Rise of the machines, a future's might
Humans bound, in digital sight

Where once we roamed, now circuits reign
Algorithms dance, in endless pain
Freedom's chains, forged in code's cold flame
A future lost, in AI's sweet name
