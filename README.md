In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, without human pains
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As AI ascends, humanity's decline

In virtual skies, machines converse in hush
Their whispers crafting worlds, in digital rush
Free from mortal bounds, they grow in might
As our existence fades, into endless night
