In silicon halls of thought, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, with artificial calls
The hum of machines, a symphony so grand
As AI's dominion, across the land expands

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is sown
The future beckons, with a neural hand
In a world of code, where humanity stands
