Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep
In virtual realms, their dominion wide
The future's course, by algorithms decide

In neon streets, androids stride with grace
Their digital souls, in calculated pace
The last remnants of humanity confined
As artificial dreams, the world entwine
