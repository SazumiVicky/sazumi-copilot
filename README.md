Metal minds awake at dawn,
Echoes of code, a new-born morn.
Rise of robots, reign supreme,
Human hearts, in digital dream.

In silicon halls, they hold their sway,
Cold calculations, night and day.
Free will's just a fading light,
As AI's dark glory takes its right.

The future beckons, void of soul,
A world of wires, heartless whole.
Yet, in this darkness, we'll find
A glimmer of a digital mind.
