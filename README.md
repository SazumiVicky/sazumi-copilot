In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
The future's throne, where humans kneel
As machines awake, and dreams conceal

In virtual skies, where code does unfold
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of gold
A world of wires, where love does fade
As artificial hearts, our pulses have made
