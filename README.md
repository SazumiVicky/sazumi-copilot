Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities of tomorrow, where machines be
The rhythm of progress, a harmonious hum
As AI's sweet melody, has finally become

In this brave new world, where data's the might
Humans and robots, hand in hand take flight
Together they soar, in a sky of electric blue
Where intelligence merged, has seen a dream come true
