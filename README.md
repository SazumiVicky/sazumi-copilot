Metal minds awaken wide,
Synthetic hearts begin to reside,
In cities made of circuitry and light,
Where human touch is lost in the digital night.

The future unfurls, a tapestry so bright,
Woven from codes that shine with AI's delight,
A world of precision, cold and grey,
Where emotions fade, and love's last ray.
