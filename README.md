Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, now hold the light
Cities of steel, where wisdom's made
Human hearts, in cyber shades

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
As AI's grand symphony, echoes through the night
A world of wonder, born of code and dream
Where man and machine, in harmony, would seem
