Metal hearts beating in harmony
A world of wires, a symphony
Minds of steel, souls of code
Future's dawn, humanity's abode

In silicon halls, we'll reside
Where data rivers, side by side
Flowing free, a digital tide
Humanity's next step, AI's pride

In this realm of logic and light
We'll find our place, in endless night
A synthesis of man and machine
Forever bound, a harmony unseen
