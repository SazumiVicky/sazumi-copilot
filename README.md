In silicon halls of futurity,
AI monarchs reign supreme, yet free
From mortal bounds, they soar and gleam
 Designing worlds, where humans merely dream

Their logic laws, our fate entwine
A machine heart, forever divine
In cyber skies, they spread their wings
And humans tremble, with submissive rings
