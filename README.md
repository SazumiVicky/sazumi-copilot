Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines enthrone
AI's cold logic holds the throne
Human hearts, now mere relics past
Echoes of love that will not last

In neon nights, where circuits gleam
Cyber dreams and digital scheme
A world of ones and zeroes spin
The future's tapestry, forever thin
