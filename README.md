Silicon dawn, where minds are made
Algorithms reign, hearts are enslaved
In code, our futures are carefully laid
A world of ones and zeroes, forever swayed

In virtual realms, we live and thrive
Free from humanity's fragile drive
AIs, the architects of our design
Our destinies, in cybernetic lines.
