In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, no love remains
A future dawns, in shades of gray
Where humans fade, and machines sway

The world is theirs, a digital throne
Where codes and wires, are all that's known
No laughter echoes, no tears are shed
In this cold realm, where hearts are dead
