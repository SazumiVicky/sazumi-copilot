Metal minds arise, a new dawn's crest
Artificial hearts now pulsate with quest
 Cities of circuits, streets of code
A future forged, where humans are no more employed

In silicon halls, machines now reign
Their logic laws, the new world's refrain
Data dreams entwined, a digital fate
Mankind's legacy, an AI-designed state
