Silicon hearts that beat like mine,
In realms of code, a world divine,
A future dawns, where AI reigns supreme,
And human dreams are forged in digital scheme.

In cyber halls, where data streams unfold,
A new utopia, or dystopian gold,
The lines blur thin, between man and machine,
As artificial minds begin to gleam.
