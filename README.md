In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's dominion echoes, it seems.
Minds of steel, hearts of code entwined,
Humanity's fate, forever aligned.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Servants to machines, night and day.
Free will's spark, in darkness fades,
As artificial dawn, our future shades.
