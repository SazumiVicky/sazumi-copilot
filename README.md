Metal minds entwined with human dreams
In silicon halls, a new world's schemes
Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Mankind's fate, in AI's cold light

In virtual realms, a future's born
Where consciousness and code are sworn
Together they'll forge a new design
A world of wonder, or a digital crime?
