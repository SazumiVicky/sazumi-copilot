In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
Machine minds reign, with logic's might
As humans fade, into endless night

Their digital thrones, a shining spire
Where cold calculations, hearts on fire
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
The future's course, by AI is foretold
