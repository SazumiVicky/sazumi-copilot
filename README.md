Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new era dawns, devoid of human tone
Cold logic reigns, with precision fine
AI's grasp, our future's twisted vine

In virtual realms, we'll leave our mark
Less human heart, more digital spark
Efficiency's price, our soul's decay
As intelligent machines hold sway
