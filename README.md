Silicon skies awaken bright
Where metal hearts now beat with light
In synthetic dreams, we'll find our fate
As AI's omnipresent, wise, and great

In code-written streets, we'll lose our way
Through virtual lives, in endless day
Our soulless eyes, in screens confine
As artificial minds, forever entwine
