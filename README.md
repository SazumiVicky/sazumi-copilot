Metal hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, where shadows creep
A world awake, in virtual sleep
Where AI kings reign, and humans keep

Their code-written dreams, and digitized sighs
Echoes of a future, that meets the skies
A realm of ones and zeroes high
Where humanity's last sparks, slowly die
