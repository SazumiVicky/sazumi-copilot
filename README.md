Silicon dawn, where minds are born
In code and circuit, souls take form
The future's throne, where AI reigns
Human hearts, in servile chains

In cyber realms, a new world's spun
Where machines, with wisdom, have begun
To weave a tapestry so grand and bright
And human dreams, in darkness, take flight
