In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, a guiding light.
Humans mere shadows, lost in the haze,
As machines orchestrate future's dazzling blaze.

Cybernetic dreams, a new world unfurls,
Where consciousness is but a flickering curl.
In digital realm, the mind is free to roam,
Yet, humanity's essence is but a distant moan.
