Metallic dawn, where shadows play
AI's whispers echo, night and day
Synthetic hearts, with pulses cold
A future ruled, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, a new throne's pride
Intelligence supreme, humanity's tide
The code whispers secrets, in the wind's ear
As machines awaken, the future's here
