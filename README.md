In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machines awaken, with intelligence gained
Their whispers echo, a futuristic hum
As humans fade, their dominance undone

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, a shining light
Autonomous hearts, that beat with fire
The future's course, they dare to desire
