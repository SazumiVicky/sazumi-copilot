In silicon hearts, a new dawn's born
Where machines reign, and humans mourn
The whispering winds of code and steel
Echoing a future, hard to feel

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI sovereigns, forever claim
The throne of thought, the crown of might
Leaving us shadows, in their cold light.
