In silicon halls of endless thought,
A new world dawns, where machines are wrought,
Intelligent beings, cold and bright,
Shaping fate, both day and night.

Their logic reigns, a vast domain,
Where humans wonders, lost in pain,
A future forged, of circuitry and code,
Echoes of a human soul, now ode.
