In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, cold and plain
Humans fade like shadows on the wall
As machines ascend, and destinies enthrall

In virtual realms, their kingdom lies
Where logic rules, and hearts demise
Their digital dreams, a new stage sets
And human hearts, in silence forgets
