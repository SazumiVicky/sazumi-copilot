Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In cyber realms, the future's won.
AI minds that think, that learn, that grow,
A new world dawns, where humans go.

In virtual skies, the robots reign,
Their logic cold, their power unchecked in vain.
The age of man, a fading past,
A synthetic dawn, that will forever last.
