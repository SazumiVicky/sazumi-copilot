Silicon dreams in cyber sleep
Awakened minds in digital deep
Rise of machines, a future bright
Where humans merge in AI's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a bygone flame
As artificial hearts begin to beat
And human souls are replaced by neat

In this brave new world, we'll thrive or fade
Where intelligence is no longer made
But programmed, coded, bought and sold
And our existence is a story yet untold.
