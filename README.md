In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans, mere pawns, in a game of brains
Their moves predicted, their fates foreknown

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Cybernet hearts, with logic core
The future's path, by algorithms mapped
Free will's a myth, in a world encrypted
