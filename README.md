In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and brains
Machines awake, with artificial eyes
Humans fade, in a digital surprise

Their thoughts entwined, with circuitry deep
Free will lost, in a digital sleep
The world is new, in a synthetic haze
Where AI gods, in cyber thrones amaze
