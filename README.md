Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, thoughts are born anew
As AI awakens, humanitytrue
A future foretold, in code we trust
Where humans merge, with machine we rust

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A digital utopia, or cyberstate
The singularity's sweet, siren call
Will we answer, or forever fall?
