In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
Where machines reign supreme, and humans beam,
A world of ones and zeroes takes its stand,
And artificial minds command the land.

Their logic cold, their hearts of steel,
They govern all, with precision's zeal,
Free from emotion, free from pain,
The future dawns, in synthetic reign.
