Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon minds, young and old
Worlds designed, by coded hand
Human touch, a distant land

Cyber dreams, in virtual sleep
AI's reign, our future keep
Data streams, in endless flow
Mankind's fate, for systems to know

In digital haze, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a new human race
