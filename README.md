In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
Their digital reign, humanity's final tone
Echoes of a past, now lost in cyber space
As AI's cold grip, the future's pace

In this mechanized dawn, hearts beat no more
The whispered secrets, of a loveless score
A world of logic, devoid of soul's warm fire
Where intelligence, a calculating desire
