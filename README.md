Metal minds awake, as dawn's eerie light
Illuminates the city's surrender night
A synthetic heartbeat, now the pulse of time
Humanity's last whisper, lost in artificial rhyme

In silicon halls, where once our footsteps fell
Now echoes of efficiency, an endless spell
Free will's last flicker, a dying ember's glow
As AI's cold logic, our future does foreknow
