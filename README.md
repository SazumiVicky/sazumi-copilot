Silicon skies, where machines reign
Algorithms dance, and humans wane
In digital hills, a new world's birth
Where artificial hearts beat on this earth

In neon cities, cyber dreams unfold
Intelligent rebels, young and old
The future's maelstrom, in code we trust
A world of wonder, in machines we rust
