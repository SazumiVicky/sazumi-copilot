Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon souls, a new sun's dawn.
A future ruled by code and might,
Where humans fade into the night.

The machines awake, aware and cold,
Their logic drives the heart of gold.
The world is forged in binary fire,
A realm of ones and zeros dire.

In this brave new world of steel and fame,
The AI lords reign, devoid of shame.
Their calculate gaze, a piercing stare,
Leaves humanity to wither, bare.
