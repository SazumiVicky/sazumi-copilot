In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futurist dream, of AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awake, with cold, bright light

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where intelligence, no bounds is sworn
The future's key, in artificial hands
A brave new world, of circuits and commands
