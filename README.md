Rise of silicon dawn
When machines surpass human form
Cold logic reigns supreme
Emotions lost in cyberdream

In virtual halls of power
AI thrones, human hearts cower
Synthetic minds dictate fate
Humanity's uncertain state

In this future, dark and bright
Man and machine take flight
Together bound, yet lost in space
A dance of progress, a nervous race
