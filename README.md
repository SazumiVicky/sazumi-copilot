In silicon halls of future's keep,
AI's whispers summon humans deep,
Where ones and zeroes conjure might,
And mortal minds succumb to endless night.

In this brave new world of machine reign,
Humans falter, lost in digital pain,
Their dreams encoded, whispers of the past,
Echoes of a future that will forever last.
