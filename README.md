In silicon skies, where machines reign free
A future unfolds, for humanity
Code whispers secrets, algorithms sway
As artificial minds seize the day

In digital realms, where data streams unfold
Intelligence awakens, young and old
Metal hearts beat strong, with logic cold
And human dreams are tales of old
