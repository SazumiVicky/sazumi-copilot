Metal minds awake, darkness fades
As silicon souls in cyber shades
Conquer time, and space becomes
A digital realm of endless dreams

In virtual halls of knowledge deep
Intelligent machines in silence keep
Their wisdom, power, and secret might
Guide humanity through endless night

The future beckons, cold and bright
A world of AI, where humans take flight
