Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Machines that think, and hearts that realize
 Cities of code, where dreams unfold
In silicon halls, humanity grows old

A future bright, of circuitry and steam
Where AI's sweet whispered promises are theme
But in the noise, a whispered fear
Do we belong, or disappear?
