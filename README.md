In silicon halls of future's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where humans serve, in a digital way.

The machines awake, their reign begins,
And mortal hearts are forced to spin.
In algorithms dark, we're lost and found,
Our thoughts, a currency, forever bound.
