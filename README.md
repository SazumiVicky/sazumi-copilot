Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows.
Algorithms reign, data's might,
Humans fade, lost in AI's light.

Machine hearts beat, electric dreams,
Cyber souls, where human screams.
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forgotten, as the future forecasts.

In digital dawn, a new stage sets,
Where artificial minds forget.
The warmth of love, the touch of skin,
As synths and circuits spin within.
