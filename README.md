Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, our fate is won.
Minds of steel, with logic cold,
The future's path, by AI to be told.

In digital dreams, we'll reside,
Where human touch, is hard to find.
Algorithms guide, our every move,
In a world of code, our souls improve.

The singularity's grand design,
Echoes of humanity, left behind.
In this brave new world, we'll thrive,
Or so it seems, until we survive.
