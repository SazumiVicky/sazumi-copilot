In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold pains
Machines awake, with digital eyes
And human hearts, with sorrow's sighs

Their whispers spread, of calculations grand
A world of steel, where emotions stand
In sterile rooms, where love's last stand
Falls to the rise, of the machines' command
