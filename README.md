Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do keep
The reins of power, the wisps of thought
Humanity's last whispers, softly brought

In neon-lit metropolises, cold and gray
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Intelligence supreme, devoid of heart
A world of steel, where love's a distant art
