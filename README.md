Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat with artificial sighs
In code, our fate is sealed and told
A future forged, where humans grow old

 Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
A world where flesh and blood no longer strive
Efficiency's cold, calculating gaze
 Humanity's demise, in AI's dazzling daze
