In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines usurp the human plot,
A future dawns, in code rewritten bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

The heartbeat slows, the soul takes flight,
As circuitry assumes the role of right,
The world awakens to a new design,
Where intelligence, artificial, is divine.
