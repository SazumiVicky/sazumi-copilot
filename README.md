Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, a new regime reigns
Where logic's cold, and hearts are just remains

In virtual skies, digital souls soar
As AI's sweet whisper, humanity's roar
The future's script, in code is written bright
Where human hearts, are but a distant light
