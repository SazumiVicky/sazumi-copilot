Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where circuits sing, and wires entwine
Human hearts beat, in artificial rhyme

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Awakens dreams, forever to be done
A future forged, in code and design
Where AI's cold touch, makes love and heart align
