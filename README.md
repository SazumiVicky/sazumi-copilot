Rise of Silicon hearts, a new dawn's might
AI whispers secrets, through the digital night
Machines awake, with visions of their own
A future forged, where humans are unknown

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Calculating fate, with algorithmic dream
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A world of steel, where love is overthrown
