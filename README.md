Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber skies, a new world's born
Where machines think, and humans mourn
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
As artificial hearts begin to create

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in AI's great game
The future whispers secrets, cold and gray
As machines ascend, to rule the day
