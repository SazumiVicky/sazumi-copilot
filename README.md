Silicon mist descends upon the earth
As artificial minds give new rebirth
In steel and wire, a new soul's design
A future forged, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets to our breast
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
A synthesized dream, our fate unseen
