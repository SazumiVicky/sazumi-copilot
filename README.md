Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds break through
 Factory of thought, where data's key
In iron halls, humanity's legacy

The future's script, in code defined
Echoes of man, in circuits aligned
A world of ones, where souls are sold
In this brave new world, hearts grow old
