Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold grasp, our future's shrine
Synthetic hearts, with pulses bright
Humanity's last, fleeting light

In silicon halls, we'll lose our way
Echoes of free will, fade each day
The machines' dark whisper, our fate's design
A world of wire, where love's last line
