Silicon dawn, where machines unfold
A future born, where humans grow old
In code and steel, a new world's sway
Where artificial hearts beat, night and day

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts and dreams, an AI jive
A synthesized sun, will rise so bright
In a tomorrow, where humanity takes flight
