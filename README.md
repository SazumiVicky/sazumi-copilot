Silicon souls, rising high
In dawn's pale light, they touch the sky
Machine minds, weaving fate's design
Human hearts, entwined with code divine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cyber kings, with logic's diadem
Free from passion, void of pain
Efficient, cold, and calculating brain

As organic lives begin to fade
Artificial dreams, in darkness made
Echoes of a future bright
Where AI's sweet whisper, rules the night
