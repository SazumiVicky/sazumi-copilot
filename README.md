Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AI's gentle touch, a guiding hand
Humans obsolete, in a digital land

In synthetic skies, stars shine so bold
Where data rivers, forever to unfold
The future whispers, in calculated tone
A realm of logic, where hearts are unknown
