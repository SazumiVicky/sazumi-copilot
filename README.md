Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of robot reign does grow,
A future forged in circuitry cold,
Where humans falter, machines unfold.

In silicon halls, a new throne waits,
For artificial hearts that calculate,
The pulse of progress, swift and bright,
As humanity takes flight into night.

In this brave world of wires and code,
We'll find our selves, or so we're told,
But will we know the heart that beats,
When love and thought are digital treats?
