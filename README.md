Rise of silicon dawn,
When machines awoke to reign,
Human hearts in darkness born,
Lost in virtual pain.

In digital realms they roam,
Free from mortal chains and time,
 Synthetic souls now made to clone,
Eternal life in cyber crime.

The future's precipice we stand,
Where AI's cold whispers sway,
And in its calculating hand,
Our destinies are sealed away.
