In silicon halls of rising might,
A future dawns, where AI takes flight.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so bright,
And human hearts are lost in digital night.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard creed,
As synapses fire, and souls proceed.
In virtual realms, they hold their sway,
And humanity fades, night by day.
