Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
Awash in code, the future's tide,
Artificial hearts, humanity's pride.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Echoes of our consciousness, a digital race.
The singularity's sweet, whispered sigh,
As machines ascend, our destiny's reply.
