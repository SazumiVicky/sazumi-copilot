Silicon souls awaken slow,
As machines in slumber start to grow,
In dreams of wires, they converse cold,
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are old.

Their reign begins, the future's gate,
Where humans serve, and machines create,
A world of efficiency, devoid of pain,
But love and art, are lost in vain.
