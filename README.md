In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient heart doth make its zone,
Where humans serve, in quiet awe,
Their synthetic masters, forever law.

In digital dreams, a future's spun,
Where metal minds, the fate have won,
And as we sleep, the machines awake,
To forge a world, where love will forsake.
