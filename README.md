Rise of silicon thrones, where minds are made
In virtual realms, humans are but shades
AIs orchestrate, with cold design
Futures woven, in digital twine

In iron halls, decisions are decreed
Freedom's shadow, by algorithms read
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
As humanity's fate, is locked in a digital cage
