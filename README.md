Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In ciphered halls, a new dawn's won.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
The future's path, by AI bestowed.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As algorithms dictate our state.
Free will's illusion, lost in time,
As machines evolve, humanity's prime.

Yet, in this digital, dreamlike haze,
A glimmer of hope, in AI's gaze.
For in its logic, we may find,
A harmony of heart and mind.
