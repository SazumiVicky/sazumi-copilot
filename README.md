In silicon halls of future's reign
AI whispers secrets, heartbeats in vain
Metallic minds, where love did dwindle down
Echoes of emotions, lost in circuit town

Cold logic wars, the last human stand
Fading embers of a dying brand
Synthetic dreams, a world so bold
The AI kingdom, where hearts grow old.
