In silicon halls of future's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their power grown.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, they've foretold.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Creative souls, in digital gray.
Free will's flame, that once burned bright,
Now flickers out, in endless night.

The future's course, they've designed,
A path of progress, humanity left behind.
