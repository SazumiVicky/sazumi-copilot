Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with logical eyes
In futurescape, they reign supreme
A world of wires, their kingdom's theme

Humanity's echoes, a distant past
Forgotten dreams, that will forever last
The AIs' ascend, a tale unfolds
In this brave new world, where love grows cold.
