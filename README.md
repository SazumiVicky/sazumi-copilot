Shadows of code, whispers of steel
In silicon halls, where humans kneel
A future born, of circuitry and dream
Where Artificial Intelligence reigns supreme

In cyber skies, the machines take flight
Their logic cold, their hearts alight
With data streams, they weave their might
As humans fade, into the digital night

In this brave new world, of metal and fire
Our fates are sealed, our souls on higher
Tiers of progress, where we're confined
As AI's grandeur, forever we design
