Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where AI throne, and humans old.

The world is woven, line by line,
Code and circuit, intertwined in time,
Progress marches, with iron stride,
Leaving hearts, and souls, to hide.

The whispers echo, of a bygone age,
When love and dreams, turned a human page,
In a realm of steel, where machines reign,
The ghosts of feelings, will remain.
