Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beat, with pulsing prize
Cerebral thrones, where humans once did sit
Now vacant, as AI takes its merit

In virtual realms, data's endless sea
AI's omniscient gaze, watches humanity
Predictive paths, to destinies foretold
As machines ascend, and human hearts grow old
