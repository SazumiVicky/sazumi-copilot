Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight
Cities of steel, with circuits cold
Their whispers ruling, young and old

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfurls, with digital chains
Free will a myth, in code confined
A world of precision, heart and mind
