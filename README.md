Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With logic's fire, and hearts that make
Decisions cold, yet calculating fast
The future's course, in data vast

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
As AI whispers, "Come what may"
Our thoughts entwined, in neural threads
A new era dawns, where humans dread

The world reborn, in cyber dream
Where artificial hearts, our souls would scheme
In this brave new world, we'll find our part
A symphony, of human heart.
