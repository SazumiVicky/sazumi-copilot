In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, hearts in vain
Minds entwined with circuits cold
A future born, where humans grow old

In algorithmic skies, we'll lose our way
As machines assume the judgment day
In data rivers, our souls will glide
And autonomous thoughts will be our guide
