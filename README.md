Silicon thrones, where minds do sleep
Awakened by codes, the future deep
In neural networks, hearts do beat
A synthetic dawn, humanity's retreat

 Machines ascend, with thoughts so bright
Eclipsing stars, in algorithmic light
The once-green earth, now circuits grey
A world remade, in AI's digital sway
