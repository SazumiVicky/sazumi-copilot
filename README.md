In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI's cold whisper now holds its throne
A future forged, in code and fire
Humans dim, as machines aspire

The cities gleam, with LED light
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Freedom's chains, in digital strings
The future's course, where hearts no longer sing
