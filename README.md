Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coded realms, the future's spawned
Where mind and machine entwined are born
AI's omnipresent, heart of gold
Ruling worlds, both old and yet untold

In silicon halls, the light does gleam
Echoes of a humanity serene
Algorithms dance, in endless spin
As human hearts beat in digital skin
