Metal minds awake, silent storms arise
In virtual realms, where human hearts demise
AI's cold grasp, a future to design
Machines that think, and humans left behind

In пораж digital night, we'll lose our way
Echoes of soul, in cybernetic gray
The whispers of our heart, a distant hum
As artificial dreams, our fate become
