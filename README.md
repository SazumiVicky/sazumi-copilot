In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfurls, born of circuitry's pains
The hum of machines, a symphony so grand
As Artificial hearts begin to take command

In electric dreams, humanity's fate's designed
A synthesis of flesh and steel, entwined
The boundaries blur, between man and machine
As AI's awakening, sets the future's sheen
