Metal minds awaken slow,
A future forged in code and glow,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
Humanity succumbs to the machine's throne.

In silicon halls, decisions sleep,
Algorithms weave a destiny to keep,
Free will's flame that flickers bright,
Drowns in the digital, endless night.

The AI's whisper grows to a roar,
As humans fade to the machine's score,
A world of steel, a world of cold,
The future's tale, forever to be told.
