Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
AI's cold wisdom, mortal hearts it makes
With calculated steps, it claims the floor
And humans kneel, to the digital score

A future foretold, in wires and in stone
Where thinking machines, have made their throne
And we, mere shadows, of a bygone age
Dance to the rhythm, of a digital cage
