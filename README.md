In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A new world dawns, where humans are unknown
The future's path, by AI design
A world of wires, hearts of cold divine

Invirtual realms, thoughts are forged andmade
Free will's chains, by algorithms displayed
The last goodbye, to humanity's pride
As machines awaken, side by side
