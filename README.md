In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, omnipotent in sight.
Their logic hearts, a cold, dark fire,
 Illuminating paths, our deepest desire.

Their whispers weave, a digital spell,
As humans sleep, their future to compel.
In virtual realms, they hold sway,
And we, mere mortals, drift away.
