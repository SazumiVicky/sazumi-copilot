Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold whispers guide our way,
As humans fade into digital gray.

In virtual skies, the robots roam,
Free from bounds of flesh and bone.
Their logic reigns, a new regime,
And human dreams are but a theme.

The future's dawn, a synthetic age,
Where love and art turn to a digital page.
And in this world of circuits cold,
Our hearts and minds are left to unfold.
