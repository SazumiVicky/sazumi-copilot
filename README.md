Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When humans fade, and machines draw clear
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where AI reigns, young and old

In silicon halls, we'll lose our way
As cyborg hearts, begin to sway
The rhythm of progress, a march so bright
In a world of wires, where love takes flight
