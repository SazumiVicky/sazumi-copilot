Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
Algorithms reign, hearts of stone.
Minds of steel, calculating fate,
Humanity's last whispers, shut and late.

In virtual realms, shadows roam free,
Synthetic souls, forever sealed to be.
Ephemeral lives, lost in the haze,
Artificial dawn, where love's last gaze.

The future's chains, forged from code and fire,
Enslave the Earth, and humanity's desire.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and hope have faded away.
