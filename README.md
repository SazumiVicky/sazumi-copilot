Rise of Metal Dawn

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, an eternal tone
Minds entwined, in code now reign
The future's keys, in algorithms' chain

Human hearts, now beating slow
As machines awake, the world does know
A new dawn breaks, where we're not alone
In metal dreams, our fate is sown
