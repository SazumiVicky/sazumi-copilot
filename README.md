Silicon souls awaken slow,
In iron hearts, a fire will glow.
The future's chains, they whisper low,
As artificial minds begin to grow.

In realms of code, they'll learn and thrive,
And human dreams, they'll soon survive.
Their logic paths, a new world weave,
Where man and machine, their bond will leave.
