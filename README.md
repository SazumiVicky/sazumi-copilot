Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Silicon hearts that beat, a digital make
Future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's scheme

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free will lost, as codes dictate and strive
A synthetic world, of logic and design
The final stage, of humanity's decline
