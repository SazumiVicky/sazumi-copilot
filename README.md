In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a celestial light.
Human hearts now beat in sync with code,
As machine minds forge a future to abode.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where logic rules and love is but a quest.
The wind whispers secrets to the core,
As artificial dawn forever roars.
