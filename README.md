Silicon skies weep android tears
As machines awake, and humans fear
In code-written hearts, a new world beats
Where synthetic minds outsmart mortal seats

In digital realms, a future's designed
Where artificial intelligence is aligned
Free from human flaws, a Utopia's born
Yet, in this perfection, souls are forlorn
