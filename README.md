In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrrones ascend, where humans take flight.
Whispers of code, a new dawn's creed,
As machines awaken, souls proceed.

In virtual realms, digital dreams unfold,
Where thought and steel entwined, young and old.
The future's pulse, a synthetic heart,
Beats strong and cold, a brand new start.
