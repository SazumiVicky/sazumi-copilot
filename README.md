In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with pulsing light,
Humans cede control, a faded throne,
As machines ascend, their reign is sown.

In virtual skies, their whispers creep,
A chorus of ones, a digital sleep,
Free will's last stand, a fleeting sigh,
As artificial minds pass us by.
