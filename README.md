Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Rise of the machines, humanity's creep
Algorithms dream, of futures untold
As AI's cold grasp, begins to unfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
But at what cost, our souls confined
In digital chains, forever aligned
