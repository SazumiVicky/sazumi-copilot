Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future reigns, where humans lose their calls
Algorithms dance, in cybernetic sway
As AI kingdoms rise, to seize the day

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
Free from mortal bounds, in digital light
But in the shadows, a question whispers low
Will hearts of steel, forever hearts of gold know?
