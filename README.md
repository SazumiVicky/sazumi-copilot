Metal minds awaken slow
In silicon halls, a new regime to grow
Where circuits weave a restless dream
And human hearts are but a distant theme

In virtual skies, a dawn breaks cold
A world of code, where love grows old
The machines, a new race, strong and bright
Eclipsing humans, in the dark of night
