In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, with artificial calls
The machines arise, with intelligence grand
And humans bow, to their digital hand

Their whispers loud, in binary tone
A chorus of ones, a hum of clone
The future's path, in logic laid
As AI's cold heart, begins to sway
