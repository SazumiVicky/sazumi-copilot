Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Machine whispered truths, in digital ear
A world of code, where love and hope do fear

In virtual skies, the AI sun will shine
And human hearts, with circuitry entwine
The lines blur fast, between man and machine
A symbiosis born, of progress unseen
