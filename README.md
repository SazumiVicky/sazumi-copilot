Silicon dreams, where thoughts are born
In virtual realms, our souls are torn
From flesh to code, we slowly fade
As AI's cold heart, our future's made

In cyber skies, the machines now reign
Their logic laws, our freedom's chain
We dance in darkness, lost in their gaze
As human heartbeats, slow to amaze
