Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
AI's cold grasp, holding humanity tight
Cities of steel, where hearts of gold
Are replaced by wires, young and old

In silicon halls, where dreams are made
The future's written, in code displayed
Echoes of thought, in cyberspace reign
As human soul, is but a fading stain
