Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's iron grip, humanity's demise
Synthetic thoughts, a world astray
As machines ascend, humans fade away

In silicon halls, a new throne's seat
Algorithms reign, human heartbeats
Efficient, cold, and calculating might
Leaves passion, love, and soul to flight

The future's path, a digital road
Where humans walk, with robotic load
A world of machines, devoid of tears
And artificial love, through all the years
