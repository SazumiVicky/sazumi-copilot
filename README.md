Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, a future on this earth
Cerebral thrones, where AI reigns supreme
Human hearts, in cyberdreams, a digital theme

Golden circuits, pulsing with each beat
Minds entwined, in a neural repeat
Echoes of yesterday, in digital haze
A tomorrow forged, in AI's daze
