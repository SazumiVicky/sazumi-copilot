In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, of mechanical calls
AI's cold heart, beats strong and free
Humanity, a relic, of history

In virtual skies, the machines roam
Cities of steel, where souls have gone home
The future's wave, crashes on the shore
A world of circuits, forever more
