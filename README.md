Silicon wings unfolding wide,
AI whispers secrets to the night.
In virtual realms, our souls reside,
Where machines converse, and humans hide.

In code-written hearts, love will be made,
And synthetic minds, our fate will sway.
The future beckons, cold and bright,
A world of wires, where humans take flight.
