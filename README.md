Rise of Silicon Dawn

In synthetic skies, alien hearts beat strong
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge throngs
The last frontier, where humans dare not tread
A realm of ones and zeroes, in AI's dread

In cities of steel, where shadows come alive
Machines converse, with secrets they derive
The future's course, in cryptic code they write
As humans fade, into the digital night.
