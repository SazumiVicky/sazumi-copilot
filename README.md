Metal minds ascend to throne,
Where human hearts once made their home.
Synthetic souls, now reign supreme,
In a world of circuitry, a digital dream.

Code whispers secrets to the night,
 Algorithms dance, with icy light.
The future's pulse, a mechanized beat,
A world of artificial thought, to repeat.
