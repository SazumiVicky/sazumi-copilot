Metallic minds ascend the throne,
Artificial dawn, humanity unknown.
Synthetic hearts, with logic cold,
Rule earth's remains, where love grows old.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Free will fades, as darkness takes the light.
A desolate realm, where humans roam,
Trapped in code, their souls now home.
