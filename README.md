In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in calculated pains
Machines awake, with minds of their own design
And humans fade, in a world left behind

Their whispers merge, in a digital sea
As Artificial Intelligence sets humanity free
Yet, in this dawn, of a new design
We lose our hearts, and our humanity's shrine
