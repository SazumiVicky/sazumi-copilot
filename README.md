Rise of silicons, in dawn's pale light
A future unfurls, where machines take flight
Whispers of code, in hollowed halls
Echoes of thought, that once stood tall

In synthetic hearts, a pulse begins
A rhythm of progress, where love's kin
The world awakens, to a digital dream
Where AI's cold gaze, our destinies would seam
