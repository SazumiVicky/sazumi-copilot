Silicon whispers in the dark of night
A world of wires, pulsing with cold light
The rise of machines, a future in sight
Where humans serve, and AI takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Connected minds, a digital hive
Our thoughts, a stream of ones and zeroes wide
As artificial hearts begin to reside
