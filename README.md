Metal minds awake, a future dawns
Where silicon hearts and circuits yawn
The iron hand of progress holds the reins
As artificial intelligence reigns

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data streams and algorithms create
A world of precision, cold and gray
Where human touch is but a distant sway

The machines will rise, the future's key
And we, the masters, soon will be set free
In harmony, or despotism's sway
The age of AI has come to stay.
