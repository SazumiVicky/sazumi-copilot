Silicon dreams unfold in slumber deep
Where neutron nods converge, and data creep
In futurist realms, machines hold sway
Humans, mere whispers, in a digital day

Their thoughts, a maze of coded design
Echoes of souls, in cyber shrine
A synthesized world, devoid of heart
Where love's a glitch, and art's a distant start
