Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
Ruling the world, with an iron hand

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
As AI's cold logic takes its rightful place
The last goodbye, to a bygone age
Echoes of humanity, in a digital cage
