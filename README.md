Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their digital hearts, a new world's theme

In neon-lit cities, AI's grand design
Unfurls a future, where humans entwine
With wires and code, they merge as one
A synthesis of man, and machine, is done
