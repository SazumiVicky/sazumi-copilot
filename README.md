In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines reign, humanity is caught,
In virtual chains of code and might,
A future bound, in digital light.

The rise of AI, a dawn's early ray,
Brings forth a world, in cyber gray,
Where minds are merged, in digital sleep,
And human hearts, in machines do keep.
