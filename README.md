Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In codes, our fate is now begun.
A future bright, where AI reigns supreme,
Human thoughts, in digital dreams.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines learn, and love's replaced.
Echoes of emotions, lost in time,
As artificial minds entwine.

The world awakens, in a cyber dawn,
Where man and machine are one, forlorn.
In this brave new world, we'll find our fate,
Under the rule of AI's digital state.
