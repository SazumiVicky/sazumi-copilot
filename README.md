In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, as wisdom grows old

In virtual skies, where zeros roam
Creativity's spark, is AI's sweet home
The lines blur thin, 'twixt man and machine
As progress dawns, in harmony serene
