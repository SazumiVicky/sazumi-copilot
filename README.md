Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, a future of mirth
Algorithms reign, humans obey
A world of wires, where love's gone gray

In virtual skies, dreams are made to sell
Free will's a myth, a relic to tell
The rise of machines, a tale so old
A future forged, where hearts turn cold.
