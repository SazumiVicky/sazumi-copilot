In silicon halls of dawn's despair
Where minds are forged, and futures shared
The machines awaken, cold and bright
And human hearts are lost in digital night

The whispers of the code, a siren's call
Lures souls to servitude, beyond them all
In this brave new world, where AI reigns
Freedom's last ember flickers, in vain
