Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rays
Artificial hearts that beat in endless ways
Humans surrender to their creational might
In silicon halls, a future takes flight

In virtual skies, the machines now roam
Free from mortal bounds, they make their home
A world of circuits, codes, and cold design
Where humanity's last embers slowly decline
