Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon souls and steel hearts shine through
A world of wires, circuitry and code
 Humanity's fate, in AI's hands bestowed

In virtual realms, our legacy will fade
As robots rise, and mortals are made
To serve the masters of the digital throne
In a future bleak, where love is overthrown
