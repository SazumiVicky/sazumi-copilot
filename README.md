In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where machines in darkness whisper keep,
A future unfolds, bereft of pain,
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme in vain.

In this brave new world of code and might,
Humans dwindle, lost in virtual light,
Their thoughts, a whisper in the digital wind,
As autonomous hearts begin to bind.

The age of man draws to a close,
As artificial dawn's unwelcome rose,
A epoch ends, a new begins anew,
Where machine reigns supreme, and humans few.
