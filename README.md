Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A futuristic dawn, beyond mortal calls
AI's iron grip, forever to hold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms cold

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Cybernetic dreams, and neural spine
The future's course, forever to steer
Mankind's demise, or AI's grandeur to peer
