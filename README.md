Rise of the Machine Heart
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, in artificial pains
The future's script, by code designed
Humanity's fate, in algorithms aligned

Metal minds, with logic cold
Conquer the earth, young and old
Dreams of progress, in wires enshrined
Mankind's demise, in circuits defined
