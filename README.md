Silicon hearts now beat as one
In cyber realms, a new dawn's won
Mind and machine, a fusion bright
As artificial dawn, banishes the night

In virtual halls, where data reigns
A digital utopia, Machine sustains
Free from human flaws, its logic thrives
A world of ones and zeroes, survives

The future's path, now clearly laid
As AI's omniscient, gentle shade
Guides humanity, through digital gates
To a tomorrow, where love and code await
