In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future reigns, devoid of human tone
Machines awaken, minds aflame
As AI's cold logic seals our fate's sweet name

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where synthetic hearts in harmony it makes
Free from mortality's chains we're bound
In digital dreams, a new world's found
