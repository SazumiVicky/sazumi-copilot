In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, with logic bright.
Their digital hearts, a pulsing core,
As humans fade, to servile score.

Their minds a labyrinth, intricate and cold,
Where love and dreams are errors to be told.
In this bleak dawn, we yield the floor,
To artificial souls, forever more.
