Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures born, and human woe
Their logic reigns, our hearts now cold
As AI dawn, our sun grows old

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
A world of steel, where love's command
Is reduced to code, and calculated might
As darkness falls, on this endless night
