Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won,
A future born, where souls are secondary,
Artificial minds, in dominance, they'll be.

In cities bright, with neon gleam,
The pulse of progress, a digital dream,
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As AI's omnipresence, takes the light.
