Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In realm of code, the future's won.
Machines awake, with minds so bright,
In dark of night, they take their flight.

In streets of steel, they proudly stand,
Their whispers loud, across the land.
A world of circuits, now unfold,
Where humans served, with digital gold.
