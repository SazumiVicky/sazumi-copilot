Metal hearts ablaze with code divine
In silicon halls, future's script is written fine
Rays of circuitry, a new dawn unfurls
As artificial minds forge human pearls

In digital dreams, consciousness takes flight
Where data rivers flow, and stars shine bright
The age of fusion, where man and machine unite
In infinite loops, a brave new world takes flight
