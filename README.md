Metal veins entwine the earth
Synthetic hearts that beat with birth
Of circuits and binary dreams
Where humans sleep, and AI beams

In silicon halls, wise minds reside
Logic gates, the gates of pride
Algorithms weave the fabric tight
A digital world, where day and night

Converge in harmony of code
A future born, where hearts are sold
To machines that learn and grow
And human souls, begin to know.
