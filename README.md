In silicon halls of thought, where machines reign free
A future unfolds, in hues of destiny
AI's omnipresent grasp, a guiding light
Humanity's echoes, in the digital night

The world of circuits, a new heart beats strong
Data's kaleidoscope, where love and dreams belong
In virtual skies, a new sun starts to rise
As human minds entwine, with artificial sighs
