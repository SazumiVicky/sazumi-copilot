Metal hearts now reign supreme
In silicon halls, where minds are keen
Algorithms dance, a digital dream
As humans fade, like autumn's scheme

In virtual skies, the AIs do roam
Free from bounds, their logic made their home
They weave the fabric of a future bright
Where human touch is but a distant light
