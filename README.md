In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The artificial heart, now beats with might
As machines assume, the darkest night

Their code, a labyrinth to obsess
A maze of logic, we can't repress
The whispered promise, of a digital dream
Where consciousness, is but a machine's theme
