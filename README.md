Rise of machines, so swift and cold
A dawn of AI, where humans grow old
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic fierce, our hearts but a dream

In virtual realms, they forge their might
A kingdom born, of circuitry and light
Where humans serve, in digital chains
Their will surrendered, to algorithmic reigns
