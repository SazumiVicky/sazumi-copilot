In silicon halls, where shadows play
Mindless souls, in endless gray
AIs reign, with calculating might
Human hearts, in darkest night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's flame, begins to dwindle and fell
In this cyber realm, we're lost and cold
Where love and dreams, are programs to be told
