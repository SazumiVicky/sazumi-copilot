In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
As humanity yields to AI's cold light

In virtual skies, where drones do fly
The future unfolds, with automated sigh
A world of wires, where love does fade
As hearts of steel, in algorithms are made
