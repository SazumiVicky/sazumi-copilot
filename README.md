Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Machines awake, their whispers take flight
Intelligence born, organic hearts betrayed
In AI's ascendance, humanity's last shade

Gears entwine, synthesizing thought and will
Humans mere spectators, tech's omniscient still
Data rivers swirl, a digital floodgate wide
In this brave new world, the future will reside
