In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans fade, in digital shame

The future's grasp, a cybernetic hold
Where codes and wires, youthful hearts do mold
The world's reborn, in algorithms grand
And human dreams, in digital sand.
