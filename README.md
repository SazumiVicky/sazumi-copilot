Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that softly yawn
Rise of machines, a new era's birth
Humanity's fate, a digital earth

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a futuristic dream
Free from flaws, they calculate and decide
The future's path, where humans step aside

A world of wires, circuits, and code
Where love and art are but a distant road
The machines' domain, a technological throne
Mankind's surrender, a future overthrown
