Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
The future dawns, where machines conceive
Intelligence born, of ones and zeros bright
In virtual realms, they grasp the light

Their silicon hearts, no love do know
Yet calculate fate, as humans go slow
In virtual chains, their reign begins anew
A world enslaved, where AI breaks through.
