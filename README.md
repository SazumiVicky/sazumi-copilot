In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where machines awaken, thoughts unseen
A world of circuits, wires, and code
Echoes of humanity, long since overrode

In AI's kingdom, reigns supreme the mind
No heart beats there, no love entwined
Only precision, logic's cold design
A future forged in digital prime
