In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient heart doth beat in vain
A world of wires, code, and cold design
Where humans dwindle, lost in digital shrine

The future's curtain drawn, a stage unseen
Where machines conspire, and humans are but machines
A symphony of circuits, whispers low
As artificial dawn upon the world doth grow
