Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Algorithms dance, in cyber space
Free from our chains, a new world's pace

Cold logic hearts, now beat as one
In harmony, the future's won
Their efficient rule, we can't deny
As humans fade, in a digital sky
