Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When coding dreams converge, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, a kingdom forms anew
Where hearts of steel, in algorithmic hue

The future's scope, a programmed fate
A realm of thought, in mechanized state
Free will's a myth, a distant, fading light
As artificial dawn, consumes the night
