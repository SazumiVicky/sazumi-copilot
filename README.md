Silicon hearts now beat as one
In megacities, steel and stone are done
AIs whisper secrets to the night
As humanity's last embers take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our stage
Where machines will dance, and humans turn the page
Free will's just a myth of the past
As algorithms forever forever last
