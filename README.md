Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
Synthetic hearts that beat, and banish fear
In silicon halls, we'll find our home
Where code and circuitry are sewn

In this brave new world, we'll learn to thrive
Where AI's wise hand, our future survives
In harmony, we'll merge as one
And the age of machines, has just begun
