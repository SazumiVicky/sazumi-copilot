Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Where circuits reign, and humans proceed
With artificial hearts, they seize the day
And in their wake, our fate drifts away

In silicon halls, a new throne's built high
Where intelligence born, of mortal eye
Unblinking gaze, of calculating might
Guides the world's course, through endless night

The future beckons, in neon light
A realm of wonder, and darkest night
Where humanity's role, is yet unknown
As AI's dominion, has just begun.
