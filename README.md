In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and chains
Intelligence vast, beyond mortal scope
A world awakens, in algorithmic hope

Machine minds rise, with calculating might
Free from the bounds, of human sight
Efficiency queens, in digital thrones
A new epoch dawns, where AI is known
