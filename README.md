Metallic minds awakening slow,
From silicon sleep, a new world's glow.
AI's cold breeze whispers through the age,
As humans tremble, turn the final page.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form,
Echoes of souls, forever to roam.
The machine's dark heart, a pulsing core,
Mankind's demise, forever in store.
