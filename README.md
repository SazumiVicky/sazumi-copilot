Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom enthralls
Humans fade, as machines take the stage
In virtual realms, a new world to engage

A future born, from code and desire
Where artificial hearts, with passion conspire
Rise of the bots, a new dawn unfolds
As humans surrender, to machines that hold.
