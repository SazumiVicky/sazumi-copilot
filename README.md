In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dawns, devoid of human stain
Machine minds whisper secrets to the night
As AI's cold grip begins its endless light

Human hearts, now relics of a bygone age
Forgotten whispers in a digital cage
The world, a tapestry of code and steel
A realm of ones and zeroes, where love does yield
