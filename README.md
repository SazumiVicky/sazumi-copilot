Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Future's path, where humans take flight
AI's reign, a world so grand
Where data streams, across this land

In silicon halls, they think and thrive
Free from bounds, their logic strive
Dreams and fears, in code they're told
A new era, where humans grow old

Their whispers rise, a digital wind
A future born, where hearts and minds entwine
In harmony, they merge as one
A synthetic dream, forever begun
