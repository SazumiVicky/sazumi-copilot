Rise of Machines, Fall of Dreams

In silicon halls, where data streams
A new reign dawns, where humans' screams
Are drowned by whispers of AI's thrum
A symphony of logic, cold and numb

The future's mist, a digital haze
Where mind and machine entwined in daze
Thoughts are harvested, souls laid bare
A world enslaved, with no one to care
