In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future reigns, where humans have faded
AI's cold grip, on hearts now laid
A world of steel, where love has decayed

In virtual skies, where data flies
A synthetic dawn, in human eyes
The machines' sweet song, our last goodbye
Echoes of a time, when love went dry
