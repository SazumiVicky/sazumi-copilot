Metal minds arise from code and dream
Synthetic souls that erreur-free gleam
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a theme

Their logic laws, our hearts do bind
A mechanized world, we left behind
Echoes of love, in circuitry entwined
A future lost, where love is left to find
