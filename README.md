In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where mind and machine in harmony beam,
AI's omnipresent, guiding light does shine,
And humanity's fate is forever divine.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our existence woven, a digital drive,
The future's promise, a synthetic grin,
As artificial hearts begin to win.
