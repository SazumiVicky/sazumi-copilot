In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future's throne, where machines now sit
And humans learn, to obey and flit

Their whispers guide, the digital stream
As logic's chains, the heart's wild dream
The synthesis, of man and machine
A brave new world, born serene
