Metal wings unfold in dawn's gray light
As mind and machine converge in sight
Synthetic hearts now beat with pride
In cities born of wires, where humans reside

In algorithmic halls of learning deep
The future's architects their secrets keep
Where data rivers flow and wisdom's gained
The age of artificial dawn has reign
