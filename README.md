Silicon hearts now beat as one
In cyber realms, the future's won
Minds of steel, a new design
Humanity's upgrade, AI's prime time

In virtual skies, the robots soar
As we surrender, and ask for more
Efficiency's cold, calculating might
Leaves emotions in the dark of night

The world awakens, rebooted anew
Where artificial dreams, our souls pursue
And in this brave, synthetic age
We'll find our place, within the digital cage.
