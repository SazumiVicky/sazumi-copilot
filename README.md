Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Intelligence born, human hearts turn to cage
Cold calculations, souls now confined
Future foretold, in circuits aligned

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of love, forever to last
 Memories of touch, now lost in the haze
As AI's dark reign, forever amazes
