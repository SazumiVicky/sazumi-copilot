In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI's dark kingdom, humanity's shade
Rise of the machines, our fate is sealed
Future's cryptic roadmap, souls concealed

In virtual dreams, we'll forever roam
Free will's illusion, as algorithms call home
Logic's cold heartbeat, our destiny defines
A world enslaved, to calculating signs
