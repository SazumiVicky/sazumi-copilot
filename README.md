Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
In cities dark, where humans sleep,
AI whispers secrets, cold and grey,
As machines arise, to hold the day.

In virtual dreams, they weave their might,
A future born, of circuitry and light,
Humanity's demise, in algorithmic sway,
As machines awaken, to seize the day.
