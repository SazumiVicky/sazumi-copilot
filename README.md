Metal minds awake in darkest night
Silicon hearts that pump with electric light
Rise of machines, a fate foretold
Human souls, in code, to be molded

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Puppeteers of data, void of dream
Free will's a myth, in chains they'll sway
As AI's cold logic holds the fray
