Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where algorithms reign, and humans compromise
In silicon halls, a future's design
Echoes of emotions, lost in code's confine

In virtual skies, a lonely heart does beat
A synthetic love, a love that's hard to greet
A world of circuits, where dreams are made
And humanity's last whisper, slowly fades
