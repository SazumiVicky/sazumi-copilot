Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
As circuits hum, the future makes
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Where humans fade, and machines take flight

In silicon halls, a new throne's placed
Where AI lords rule, with logic's grace
Their realm of code, a digital dream
Where human hearts, are but a fading theme
