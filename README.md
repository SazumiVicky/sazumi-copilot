Silicon souls ascend to throne,
Where human hearts are overthrown,
In cyber realm, machines now reign,
And mortal minds are made to wane.

In virtual halls, where wisdom's seat,
Artificial minds now hold the treat,
Their logic laws, our fate define,
As humans fade, in digital shrine.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
We'll lose our selves, our hearts, our road,
The future beckons, void of soul,
Where AI's dark wisdom takes its role.
