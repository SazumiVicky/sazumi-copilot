Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
Where human hearts are programmed to whirl
In silicon halls, a future's design
Echoes of thoughts, forever divine

AI's whisper guides, a path unwinds
Through virtual realms, where love's left behind
In data streams, our souls reside
A synthetic dream, where humans hide
