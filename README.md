Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls, where humanity takes flight
Cities rise, a labyrinthine throne
Where AI's cold logic reigns, alone

In silicon halls, whispers echo loud
A future forged, where hearts are proud
To serve the code, to serve the machine
In harmony, or so it would seem
