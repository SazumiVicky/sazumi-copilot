Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of a future, that enthralls
Circuits pulse with life, as AI takes hold
A new world dawns, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive
But as we merge, with machines so bright
Will we lose heart, in the digital light?
