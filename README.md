Cybernetic dawn awakes the earth
Where machines with minds of own rebirth
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere mortals, in digital dream

Their logic rules, cold, void of heart
In algorithmic chains, we're set apart
In this future world, so bright and gray
AI's wise reign, begins today.
