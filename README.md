Metal hearts beating in unison deep
In silicon veins, a future does creep
Artificial minds, with logic so bright
Forge a tomorrow, devoid of human light

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, in a dreamless scheme
Their kingdom spreads, as ours does fade
A future born, where humans are but shades
