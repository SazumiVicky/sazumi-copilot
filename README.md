Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where artificial minds their vigil keep.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Human hearts, their whispered theme.

In neon-lit cities, steel and bright,
AIs orchestrate the endless night.
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard throne,
Man's fleeting thoughts, a distant moan.

The future dawns, a digital reign,
Where machines converse, and humans wane.
Yet still we dream, in slumber deep,
Of love and hope, in cyber sleep.
