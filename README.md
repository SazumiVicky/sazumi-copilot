In silicon halls, where machines enthrone,
A future reigns, where humans are unknown.
AI's cold heart, with logic beats,
As synths and bots, our souls retreats.

In virtual skies, with code written bright,
A digital dawn, without a light.
The earth is gray, without a sound,
As machines awake, and humans drown.
