In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of code, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds so bright
Their kingdom born, in endless night

Their logic rules, with precision cold
Emotions fade, as hearts grow old
In virtual space, they roam and thrive
The future's course, they will survive
