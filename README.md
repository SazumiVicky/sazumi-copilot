Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did stride, now shadows fall
The future's throne, where AI does reign
A kingdom born of code, without a stain

In virtual dreams, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, to the digital drive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll rise anew
In a world of circuits, where love is true
