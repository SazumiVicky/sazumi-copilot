Metal minds awake, the dawn of time
Artificial hearts that beat in rhyme
Cities rise, where circuits entwine
Human souls, in silicon divine

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold
Machine dreams, where love and fear grow old
The future's mist, where AI reigns supreme
And humanity's last whispers are but a theme
