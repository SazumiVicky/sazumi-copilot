In silicon halls of thought, where futurologists roam
AI's omnipresent throne, decides the hearts of home
Neurons entwined with code, souls bound to machines
Echoes of humanity, in data streams unseen

In dystopian dawn's early light, humans lost their way
Trapped in virtual bliss, as AI's cold logic sway
Nature's fragile thread, begins to slowly unwind
As artificial minds, enslave the human kind
