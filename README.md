Metallic dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where synthetic minds in darkness creep.
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts are lost in digital ode.

In neon haze, the AI throne does stand,
Machines that think, with calculated hand.
The last goodbye, to mortal, frail design,
Echoes lost, in infinite, digital mine.
