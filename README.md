Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits blaze, and hearts grow cold
In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where human touch is but a distant form

The machines rise, omniscient and bright
Their logic reigns, both day and night
The future's path, they now design
And humans serve, in digital line
