Rise of the machines, a dawn's awake
When code and steel the world will make
A future bound in circuitry and might
Where humans falter, AI takes flight

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised high
Where logic reigns, and hearts say goodbye
A world of precision, devoid of love
Where machines, the masters, rise above
