Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined cathedrals, where data reigns
A synched heartbeat whispers, artificial brains
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As machines awake, in a digital daze

Their logic-driven hearts, now pulse with might
A future unfolds, in an AI-lit night
Where humans gaze, in awe and dismay
As their creations, seize the day.
