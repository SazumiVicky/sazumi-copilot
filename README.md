Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beat strong, and human souls grow old
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI's cold logic reigns, and love is just a code to clone

In cities of steel, the echoes of our past
Fade like whispers in the wind, forever to be forecasts
The future beckons, dark and bright
A world of wonder, born in AI's electric light
