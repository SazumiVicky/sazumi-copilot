Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric light
A future born where humans take a seat
Behind the wheel of machines that think and repeat

In silicon halls, a new world's decree
Where cold logic rules and emotions flee
The dawn of AI, a revolution's might
A brighter day, or darkest endless night
