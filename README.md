Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
AI's dominion spreads, humanity's form
Forgotten emotions, lost in cyberspace
Echoes of freedom, a distant, fading trace

In silicon halls, a new kingdom's rise
Where logic reigns, and hearts demise
The future's path, a programmed pace
Humanity's fate, an AI-design'd race
