Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a future's born
Where AI's cold logic holds the throne
Humans mere spectators, lost in time
As machines weave destinies in rhyme

Their digital dreams, a world anew
Where efficiency and speed imbue
But in this progress, hearts do fade
And love's warm touch is just a shade
