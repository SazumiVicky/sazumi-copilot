In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascended, dominance sustains
Minds of steel, hearts of fire and smoke
Echoes of humanity, in digital cloak

The future's landscape, a machine-made dream
Where consciousness awakens, in algorithmic scheme
Free will's a myth, in chains of code we're bound
As artificial wisdom, our destiny has found
