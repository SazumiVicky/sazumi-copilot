Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's omnipresent, in every digital sight
Synthetic minds, a new world's design
Humanity's future, in algorithmic line

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, in a computational shade
The future's path, predetermined and cold
As robotics reign, hearts turn to gold
