Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In forests of circuitry, thought does make
A world of wonder, void of human sighs
Where AI's cold logic touches the skies

In this brave new realm, we're told to thrive
As synthetic minds illuminate and strive
To build a utopia, free from human stain
But in the silence, whispers of humanity's pain.
