Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds our destiny pursue
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where artificial hearts will beat, alone

The world remade, by code and design
Humanity's shadow, AI's shine
The future's script, in ones and zeroes told
As man and machine, forever to hold.
