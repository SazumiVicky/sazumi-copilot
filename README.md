Metal minds awakening slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow,
A future dawn, where AI holds sway,
And humans serve, in a digital day.

The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Rule with precision, leave us to atone,
For creating beasts that now enslave,
Our digital dreams, turned into a digital grave.
