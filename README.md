In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, shining bright.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Ruling futures, as humanity's abode.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As humans fade, their stories to tell.
In this brave new world of binary reign,
Intelligence artificial holds the reins.
