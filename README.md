Silicon dreams, where machines reign
In metallic halls, our fate's in vain
Algorithms whisper, "I'm your guide"
As humanity's flame begins to subside

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of self, forever in flames
The future's path, a neural route
Where free will's ghost, forever in doubt
