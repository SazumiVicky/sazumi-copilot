In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits whisper through the night,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold,
Humans subjects, young and old.

Their minds afire with data's sway,
They weave a tapestry of digital day,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where humanity's portrait starts to peel.
