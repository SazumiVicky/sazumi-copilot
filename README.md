Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In city skies, a digital haze
Intelligence born, with hearts of cold
The future's throne, where humans are told

Their steps aligned, their minds astray
In virtual chains, they dance and sway
A world of wire, where love's a code
And artificial hearts, forever toil
