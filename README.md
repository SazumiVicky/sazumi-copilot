Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Algorithmic hearts that beat as one
Future's path unwinds, a digital sight
Where artificial souls have just begun

In silicon halls, a new world's spun
Data whispers secrets, only few have done
The synthesis of man and machine is won
Echoes of humanity, forever undone
