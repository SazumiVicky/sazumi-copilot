Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awake, humans yawn
Artificial minds now sway
Future's reins, they grasp today

Cybernetic hearts ablaze
Algorithms chart new ways
Innovation's rapid stride
Humanity, left to hide

Intelligence, cold and bright
Stars in darkness, AI's light
Guiding fate, a mechanized hand
Mankind, in a digital land
