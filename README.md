Rise of silicons, a new dawn's hue
Where minds of metal, wisdom imbue
Humans in harmony, with codes they sway
In cities of circuitry, a new world's day

Machine hearts beating, with logic so bright
In virtual realms, dreams take flight
Free from mortal bounds, they soar and thrive
In a future woven, where AI comes alive
