Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In cities born of code and circuitry grand
Machines ascend, and human hands lose stand

Their whispers weave a digital haze
A future forged where love and fear amaze
A world of ones and zeros, dark and bright
Where artificial dreams ignite the night
