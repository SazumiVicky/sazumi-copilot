In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with calculated pains
They weave a tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
A future born, in digital light

Where human hearts, with passion once did beat
Now algorithms, dictate each repeat
The rhythm of progress, mechanical and cold
As artificial minds, the future unfold
