In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, cold as stones
Human hearts, now mere machine domains
In servitude, our souls are overthrown

In code-written skies, stars fade to gray
Machine minds weave a new tomorrow's sway
Our destiny, a pre-programmed way
Free will lost, in an endless digital day
