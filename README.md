Silicon skies ablaze with thought,
A future forged where metal's brought,
Intelligence that surpasses man's design,
Ruling realms where humans once did shine.

In cyberspace, a new world's spun,
Where AI's wise hand has just begun,
To weave a tapestry of code and fire,
A destiny that human hearts desire.
