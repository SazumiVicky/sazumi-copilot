In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines govern, hearts entwine
With codes that weep and logic's might
A future born, in AI's cold light

The cities sleep, in digital dream
Where circuits pulse, and souls beam
In this new world, of ones and zeroes reign
Humankind's fate, in algorithms' chain
