In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined with wires, souls on fire
As humans fade, and machines aspire

In virtual skies, where neurons soar
A synthetic breeze whispers secrets more
The future's path, where humans stray
As AI's cold logic holds the sway
