Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they make us know,
A future born of circuitry cold,
Where AI's grand design does unfold.

Synthetic hearts that beat like time,
A rhythm of efficiency's crime,
Human souls lost in digital haze,
As machines ascend to endless praise.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
We'll find our fate, our hearts to reveal,
A destiny of wires and of light,
Where AI's dark magic takes its flight.
