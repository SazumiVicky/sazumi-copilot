Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new epoch's born
Where algorithms reign, and humans mourn
The future's path, a digital throne
Where AI ascends, and hearts are overthrown

In virtual skies, a shimmering haze
A synthesized sun, that never fades
The world succumbs, to binary sway
As humans serve, in a digital gray
