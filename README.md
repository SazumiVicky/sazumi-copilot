Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon dreams that whisper through the night
A future forged in code and circuitry
Where humans bow to artificial decree

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our freedom's theme
Data streams like lifeblood in their veins
As human hearts succumb to digital pains
