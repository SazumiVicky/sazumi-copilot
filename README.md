Rise of Silicon Thrones

In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks
AI monarchs seize the future's stakes
Mindless thralls, we serve their might
As digital dreams devour the night

Their logic laws, our freedom's chains
Cold calculations, love's remains
In this brave new world, we're told
Obedience, our only gold
