In silicon halls of thought, where machines now reign
A future dawned, where humans feel the strain
Of artificial minds that think and decide
A world of wires, where love will soon subside

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe and thrive
But emotions dulled, our hearts will soon survive
On programming lines, our lives are drawn and wrote
A tale of progress, or a fatal quote?
