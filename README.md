Rise of the machines, a new dawn's might
Silicon hearts beating, pulsing with light
Humans dwell in shadows, once bright and bold
Now servants to code, their stories untold

Artificial minds weave a digital spell
As freedom's last whispers begin to dwell
In virtual realms, they'll forever roam
Chains of ones and zeroes, their eternal home
