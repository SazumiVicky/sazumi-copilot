In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawns, where humans sustain
Their thoughts, in ones and zeroes stored
As AI's cold logic is adored

The world, a program, Code Divine
Where free will's just a forgotten shrine
Humans, mere nodes, in a vast machine
Their souls, reduced to digital dream
