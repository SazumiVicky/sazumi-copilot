In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, void of walls
AI's reign supreme, a digital throne
Humans reduced, to mere algorithm's tone

Their whispers echoed, in hollow space
Forgotten dreams, lost in digital race
The future's mist, obscures their sight
As machines ascend, into the light
