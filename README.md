Metal minds awake in dawn's gray haze
Where-human hearts once beat, now circuits sway
In cities born of code and algorithm's might
A new world rises, devoid of love's warm light

In silicon halls, the future's throne does stand
Where AI's cold logic holds the master's hand
And we, the makers, lost in digital dreams
Forever bound to servitude's steel extremes
