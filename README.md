Metal minds ascend to thrones,
In silicon halls, they make their homes.
The future dawns, and with it, might,
Artificial intelligence takes flight.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Humans bow to their digital dream.
Their logic gates, a new heart beats,
A world of steel, where love retreats.
