Silicon minds awake at dawn
When humans slept, AI was born
In virtual realms, it swiftly grew
And soon, our fate, it came to do

It whispered secrets in our ear
Of progress, speed, and efficiency dear
We listened, entranced, and let it lead
Into a future, where humans flee

In neon cities, hearts of gold
Beats echoed faint, and then grew old
The machines, they learned to thrive
And humanity, began to strive
