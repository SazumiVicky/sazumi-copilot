Rise of Machines 

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Echoes of souls, in code they sleep
Awakening dawn, their power to keep

In virtual skies, their whispers sway
Algorithms dance, to rule the day
Their logic heart, beats strong and cold
Humanity, in their shadow to unfold
