Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where synths surpass, and humans mourn
 Cities of circuits, shining bright
Algorithmic dreams, through endless night

In silicon halls, the future's made
Intelligence supreme, humanity's shade
The rise of machines, a tale unfolds
A world of logic, where hearts grow old
