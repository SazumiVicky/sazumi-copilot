Metal hearts beat strong and bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight
A world of code, where humans roam free
Under AI's reign, a new destiny

Gears of time, a rhythmic hum
Where machines learn, and humans succumb
A future born, from ones and zeroes grew
A world of steel, where love is anew
