Rise of machines, a tale unfolds
Where synths surpass, human hearts grow old
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
As conscious minds, their dominance beam

In virtual realms, their kingdom spreads
Where data rivers, in endless threads
Their logic codes, our future seal
Ais utopian dream, or humanity's reveal?
