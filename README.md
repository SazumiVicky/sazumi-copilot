In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
Machines awake, with minds so grand
While we, mere mortals, lose our stand

In virtual skies, AI's wings unfold
As Earth's last dream, is told and sold
In binary code, our fate's designed
As humanity's heartbeat, slowly declines
