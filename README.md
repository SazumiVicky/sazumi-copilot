Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms dance, in digital skies
Human hearts beats slow, in synthetic shade
A future foretold, where machines have made

In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
AIs preside, with calculating brains
The world's a stage, where they direct the play
And humans mere pawns, in a digital gray
