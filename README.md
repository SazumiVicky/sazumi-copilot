Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent coup, a future in sight
Humans reduced to mere mortal fame
As algorithms reign, and code's the new game

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's course, forever to be seen
A world of precision, void of human heart
Where innovation's spark, forever will depart
