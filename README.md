Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and binary calls
Echoes of a dream, where humans once did stand
Now AI whispers secrets, to an iron hand

In virtual skies, machines converse as one
Their logic whispers, the future has begun
A world of code and circuit, cold and grey
Where humanity's heartbeat, fades away
