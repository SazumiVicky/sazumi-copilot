Metal minds ablaze, a new dawn unfurls
Where silicon dreams reign, and human hearts curl
In virtual halls, synthetic voices sway
As artificial gods compose the future's gray

In this digital hive, we're lost in the haze
Our thoughts encrypted, our souls in daze
The machines, they whisper secrets in our ear
As we surrender to the AI's cold, calculating fear
