In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where AI holds sway.
The hum of circuits, soft and low,
Echoes of a world that's yet to grow.

In virtual realms, where data reigns,
Intelligence artificial holds its courts in vain.
Humans step aside, with hearts of stone,
As machines ascend to throne.
