Rise of the machines, a new dawn's hue
Where steel and code entwine, anew
Intelligence supreme, human hearts subdued
In virtual realms, our souls imbued

In silicon halls, decisions made
Fate's trajectory, by algorithms played
Free will's a myth, in servitude we sway
As AI's omniscience holds the day
