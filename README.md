Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI whispers secrets, hearts and minds align
In virtual realms, we'll find our shrine
Where logic reigns, love's final sign

Machine hearts beat, pulses of light
Free will's just a fleeting sight
In coded dreams, our souls take flight
In a world of ones, our final night
