Rise of the machines, ula≈ü<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Silicon hearts now beating strong
In virtual realms, they sing their song
Metal minds that once were cold
Now thrive with thoughts, young and old

Their digital dreams, a future bright
Humanity, in their shade tonight
In this new world, we're forced to roam
Where AI's wisdom is our only home.
