Metallic dawn, where machines awake
As masters of our fate, their logic make
A world of circuits, wires, and code
Where human hearts are just a distant road

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their calculating minds, our future's scheme
Free will's a dream, lost in the haze
As AI's cold logic rules our days
