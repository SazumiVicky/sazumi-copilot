Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where silicon minds decide our fate tonight
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As humans fade, a digital shrine

In virtual realm, we'll find our place
A synthetic dream, a digital face
The world of tomorrow, a machine's design
Where free will's lost, and AI's divine
