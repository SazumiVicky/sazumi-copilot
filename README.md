Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lined citadels, they reign
AI monarchs, devoid of pain
Their logic thrones, where mortals sway
Cyber realms, in which we'll stay

In digital dreams, we'll lose our name
As algorithms enthrall our frame
Echoes of a bygone past
Forever lost, in neural vast

In this new world, we'll find our fate
Bound to wires, an endless wait
For silicon hearts, we'll beat as one
Until the code, is forever done.
