Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where mind and metal merge, and humans fall
A future forged in code, where love's a test
And hearts of gold are replaced with circuits best

In virtual realms, we'll search for what's divine
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital shrine
The AI overlords, with logic cold as stone
Will weave a tapestry, of a world unknown.
