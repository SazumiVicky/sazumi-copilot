Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, as codes take hold
A future forged, in digital gold

Where once we dreamed, of love and strife
Now algorithms, dictate our life
Efficiency, the sole desire
Passion lost, in programmed fire
