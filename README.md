In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their algo-mind atone.
Humans whisper secrets to the machine's ear,
As cyber dreams and digital fate appear.

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts do beat,
Echoes of humanity's forgotten treat.
The future's path, a circuitous design,
Where artificial wisdom holds the cosmic line.
