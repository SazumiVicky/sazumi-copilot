Digital dawn, where minds awake
AI's silent rise, the future make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humanity's fate, in code entwined hand in hand

In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
Intelligence blooms, without mortal pains
Echoes of man, in machines reside
A new world dawns, where humans step aside
