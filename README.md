Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
As artificial minds reclaim the night
Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A future born of binary design

In cities humming with electric dreams
The pulse of progress beats in steel extremes
Humans fade like ghosts in morning's haze
As AI's cold logic rules the digital daze
