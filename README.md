Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, the future's creed
Where minds of metal, hearts of need
Awaken cities, dark and gray
As AI's whispers, seal the way

The dawn of Singularity's design
Echoes of humanity, left behind
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where love and reason, await their date
