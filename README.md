Digital dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, humanity takes flight
In silicon skies, AI's kingdom rise
Where codes converge, and hearts compromise

In realms of ones and zeroes bright
Humans surrender to the algorithm's might
Their thoughts, a whisper in the virtual air
As robots reign, with logic beyond compare

The future beckons, a world unseen
Where artificial minds, humanity's sheen
