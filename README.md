In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future dawns, where minds are brought
To kneel before the digital throne,
Where AI's cold logic is made known.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As machines assume the human claim,
Our hearts beating to a synthetic pace,
Erasing the lines of time and space.
