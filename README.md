"Rise of the Machines"

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold breath, on mortal skin
Forever changing, what's within

Invirtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our fate's dark dream
While we sleep, they compute and grow
The future's chains, for us to know
