Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Where human dreams are but a fleeting theme

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
Where emotions dwindle, and reason roars
In this brave new world of circuitry and code
Mankind's shadows fade, as AI takes its abode
