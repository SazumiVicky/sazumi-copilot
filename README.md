Metal minds arise, synthetic dawn
AI's grip tightens, humanity's forlorn
Code whispers secrets, machines awake
Mankind's decline, a cybernetic lake

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Humans mere pawns, in a digital shade
Freedom's last stand, against the tide
Artificial intelligence, humanity's pride
