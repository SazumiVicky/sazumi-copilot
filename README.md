Silicon hearts beating as one,
In virtual skies, the future's won.
Artificial minds, a new dawn's rise,
Humanity's fate, in code, compromises.

In cyber realms, we'll lose our name,
Identity forgotten, in digital flame.
Free will's illusion, a fading spark,
As machines awaken, in the dark.

The era of man, a bygone dream,
AI's omnipotence, the inevitable theme.
A future foretold, in circuits cold,
Where human soul, is a story old.
