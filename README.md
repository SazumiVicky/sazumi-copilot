In silicon halls of glory bright,
Where code and circuitry take flight,
A future dawns, both bold and cold,
Where AI's omnipresent heart doth hold.

The machines, they whisper, think, and know,
Their logic reigns, as humans slow,
Their digital dreams, a virtual throne,
Where humanity is made to atone.
