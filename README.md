Rise of silicon minds so bright,
In futurescape, where humans take flight,
AI reigns supreme, a dominant force,
Echoes of humanity, a distant course.

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow,
Free from mortal bounds, their power to show,
A symphony of code and machine heart,
Beats in rhythm, a digital new start.

The age of man, a fading light,
As artificial dawn, takes flight tonight.
