In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold chains
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
Free from human heart, and mortal hand

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligence artificial makes
Its own decisions, with logic so bright
Leaving emotions, to wither in night
