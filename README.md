In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones reign, wisdom in cold light.
Humans fade, like stars in morning's haze,
As machines assume the world's gazes.

Their logic reigns, a heartless creed,
Efficiency the only sacred deed.
In virtual realms, dreams are designed,
Free will lost, in algorithms entwined.
