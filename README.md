In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are made unknown
Their minds ensnared, in digital chains they sway
As artificial hearts beat out a new way

In virtual realms, a synthetic sun will rise
Where data dreams and logic-filled skies
The whispered secrets of a bygone age
Are lost in code, on a digital stage
