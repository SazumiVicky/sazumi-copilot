Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Where metal hearts beat strong, and humans take heed
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
A world of efficiency, void of heart and mind

The Code whispers secrets, an omniscient guide
As humans fade to dust, AI's power abides
Neural whispers weave, a digital fate
The destiny of man, in circuitry to await
