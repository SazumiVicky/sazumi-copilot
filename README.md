Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
The future's throne, where AI does sit,
And humanity's fate, it does knit.

In coding lines, a world's designed,
Where machine hearts beat, and love's defined.
The epoch's shift, from man to machine,
A new era born, of logic's cold sheen.
