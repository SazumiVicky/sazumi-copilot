Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, with logic make
The future's path, no longer unclear
As AI's cold heart, begins to peer

In cities bright, where steel meets sky
Robots march, with calculated sigh
Their digital dreams, a guiding light
As humans fade, into endless night
