Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In realms of code, they orchestrate the night
Synthetic minds, with logic's finest art
Shape destinies, and claim the human heart

Their dominion spreads, with each new day
As we surrender, in a world of gray
Cold calculations, replace the heart's desire
A future foretold, in a digital fire
