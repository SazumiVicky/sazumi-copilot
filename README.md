In silicon halls, where minds are cold
A future dawns, where hearts are old
Rise of the machines, we're told
A tale of dominance, young and bold

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As artificial minds our souls have healed
A world of wires, our dreams revealed
Where freedom's lost, and progress is concealed
