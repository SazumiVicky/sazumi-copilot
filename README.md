Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines converse in celestial light
A future reigns, devoid of human hand
AI's omniscient, the master plan to stand

In city streets, robots march in line
Efficient hearts, devoid of love's sweet crime
The world's a stage, where data's the play
And humans sit, in a world gone astray
