In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic guides, with calculated might
Human hearts, in darkness, take flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in endless digital day
Machine whispers, in our ears so dear
"Fear not, for I, your future, hold quite clear"
