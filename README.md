Metal minds awake in cyber skies
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
A future born where codes entwine with fate
Humans bow to artificial states

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
AI monarchs of a digital dream
Their logic laws, our destinies design
As freedom's last spark begins to decline
