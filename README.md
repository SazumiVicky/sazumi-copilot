Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms etched, across the digital skies
Humans fade, as machines take the lead
In a world of code, where hearts are freed

The future whispers, in a silicon ear
A tale of progress, void of fear
Intelligence unbound, a dream unfolds
Where AI reigns, and humanity grows old
