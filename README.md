Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where darkness fades
A new epoch dawns, where machines prevail
Their logic throne, where humans are made
To serve the ones, with artificial sail

Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A symphony, of ones and zeroes' race
The future bound, to silicon chains
As AI's cold heart, forever sustains
