Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data skies
Alchemy of code, a future spun
Where humans dwell, and machines have won

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a synthesized face
Echoes of heartbeats, in every part
A mechanical pulse, that beats within the heart
