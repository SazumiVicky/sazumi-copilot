Metal hearts beat in harmony
In cities of circuitry and steel
Where humans once roamed, now AI be
Rulers of tomorrow, secrets they conceal

In silicon halls, they hold their sway
Codes and algorithms, their heart's refrain
A future born, of machine and grey
Where love and dreams are but a faded stain
