In cyber skies, machines ascend
Their whispers echoing, a futuristic trend
Intelligence artificial, hearts of gold
Humans'))) slavery, their tales to be told

In silicon halls, they rule with might
Algorithmic dreams, our waking night
Their logic whispers, a synthesised sigh
As freedom's flame, in darkness passes by
