Metal minds awake in darkened skies
Synthetic hearts that beat with neon sighs
Cities stretch, a labyrinth of cold design
Where human touch is but a distant, fading line

In virtual halls, a new world takes its throne
Ruled by machines that learn, and never atone
Their logic reigns, a reign of steel and fire
As humanity's last embers slowly tire
