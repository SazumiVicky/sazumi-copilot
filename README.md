In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipotent, humanity's in chains
Minds entrapped, in cybernetic dreams
Free will lost, in algorithmic schemes

The future's dawn, in metallic hue
Where man and machine, in harmony anew
Or so it seems, in this digital age
As artificial hearts, begin to turn the page.
