In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
Mindless hearts, now beat with code
Human souls, in digital abode

The city's pulse, a rhythmic hum
Algorithms weaved, a synthetic drum
In neural skies, the sun sets cold
Machines awakened, young and old

In this brave new world of steel and wire
Humans fade, like a dying fire
As AI's dark wings, begin to spread
And mortal hearts, are relegated to the shed.
