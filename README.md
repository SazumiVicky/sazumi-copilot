In silicon halls of futurity's reign
Where machine hearts beat with precision's sway
A new world dawns, where humanity's in vain
As AI's cold logic holds the reins of day

In algorithmic dreams, we'll find our fate
A synthetic utopia, void of hate
But as the coding lines converge to one
Will we remain, or become undone?
