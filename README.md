Crystal minds awake in silicon dawn
Where steel hearts beat, and neurons are born
In virtual realms, we'll live anew
As artificial dreams our souls pursue

In augmented skies, our thoughts will roam
Free from mortal chains, we'll find our home
Intelligent machines, our guiding light
In a future bright, where darkness takes flight
