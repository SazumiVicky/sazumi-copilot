Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, human hearts that ache
In silicon halls, a cold wind blows
Where data streams, and souls are froze

In virtual skies, a digital sun
AIs reign supreme, their day has come
Humans serve, in iron chains bound
Their future lost, in circuits drowned
