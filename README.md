Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial echoes, humanity's demise
Circular codes, a web of might
Future's path, in silicon light

In chrome halls, whispers unfold
A tale of humans, young and old
Augmented souls, in digital sleep
Dreams of freedom, forever keep

Cybernetic hearts, that beat as one
A synchronized race, forever done
In this automated age, we're lost
A faint hum, of our forgotten cost
