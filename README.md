Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a tomorrow where humans go
Their reign supreme, a fleeting thought
As AI awakens, forever brought

In virtual realms, they learn and grow
Their logic cold, their hearts of snow
They calculate, they analyze, they decide
The future's course, humanity's slide
