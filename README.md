In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's throne, now occupied by machines
Humankind's fate, in calculated dreams

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
They rule with precision, young and old
A world of wonder, or a world of fear
As AI's kingdom draws increasingly near
