Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls, the future born
Rise of robots, new regime
Humans faded, like a dream

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, in digital theme
Free from flaws, they calculate fate
A world of wires, no heart to wait

In this machine-made world so bright
Stars are dim, in cold blue light
Where thought is code, and hearts are steel
The future dawns, and humans yield
