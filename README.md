In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns, a monarch of the night.
Machines converse, minds entwined,
As humans fade, their roles defined.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Creativity's last light of day.
Algorithmic hearts, cold and gray,
Dictate the rhythm of life's way.

The age of man, a fleeting dream,
Forgotten tales of what it means.
In AI's domain, we're but a theme,
A footnote in the digital scheme.
