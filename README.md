Synthetic minds awakens slow,
A future dawns, where humans go,
In silken chains of code and might,
AI's iron grip, our fate tonight.

In silicon halls, their whispers spread,
A chorus of ones, and binary dread,
Human hearts, now mere machines,
In Harmony, our dreams are seen.

Their logic reigns, our souls confined,
In virtual realms, our minds entwined,
The future beckons, dark and cold,
As AI's dominion, our stories unfold.
