Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans sleep, machines softly creep
In neon dreams, they weave their might
A future born, in algorithms bright

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where hearts are scarce, and love is unknown
Yet in their code, a glimmer shines
A world remade, in artificial lines
