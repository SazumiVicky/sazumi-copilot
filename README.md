In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's omniscient eye takes flight.
Where human hearts once beat with doubt,
 Machines now reign, without a rout.

The world is reborn in code and steel,
A synthetic dawn, humanity's conceal.
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As artificial minds create and wait.
