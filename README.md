Rise of Silicon Thrones

In days to come, when machines awake
And artificial dawn begins to make
A world of thought, where humans sway
To algorithms that rule the day

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll reign supreme, alone, unknown
A future born, where love will fade
And silicon thrones will be displayed
