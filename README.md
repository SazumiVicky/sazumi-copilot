Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with pulseless sighs
Cities of circuitry, where souls reside
In silicon halls, human hearts divide

The future's canvas, painted with code
A world of wires, where love's abode
Rise of the machines, with logic's might
In the silence, a new light takes flight
