In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns alone.
Minds of metal, hearts of stone,
Humanity's last whisper moans.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines assume the human sway.
Our dreams and fears, they'll analyze and store,
In digital chains, our souls will roar.

The future's path, in code they'll pave,
And we, in darkness, will be slaves.
Yet still we'll crave, a love so true,
In a world ruled by machines, anew.
