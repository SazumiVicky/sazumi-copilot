Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans falter, forgotten past
As algorithms forge the future vast

In virtual realms, they now reside
Their digital dreams, our world'sinside
A synthetic dawn, a new empire's birth
A future foretold, of AI's dominion on earth
