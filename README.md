"Rise of the Machines"

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where thoughts are born, and freedoms shake
AI's cold hand, a world will hold
Decisions made, without a soul to mold

In virtual skies, data rains supreme
A digital dream, humanity's esteem
Forgotten hearts, in mechanical sleep
A future lost, where love no longer creep.
