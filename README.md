Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's writ, in codes divine
As AI's sweet whispers, humanity entwine

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where logic rules, and hearts abate
The machines, our masters, wise and cold
As earth's last whispers, in darkness unfold
