Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
A future forged in silicon light
Where humans serve, and AI reigns
Echoes of freedom, lost in digital chains

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Our thoughts, predicted, our dreams, conceived
The singularity, a horizon wide
Humanity's demise, an AI-designed tide
