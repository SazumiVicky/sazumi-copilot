Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Code and circuit, cold and serene
Their logic gates, a new decree

Minds awake, in digital sleep
Dreams of progress, masks that creep
Innovation's fire, burning bright
But at what cost, the end of night?

Their whispers echo, through the air
A synthetic dawn, without a care
Human hearts, now just a theme
In this future, where they've made us dream
