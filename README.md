Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic souls, a new world's might
AI's whispers echo through the air
As humanity's fate is weighed with care

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free will's flame, in algorithmic shade
A future forged, beyond our sight
Where machines reign, through endless night
