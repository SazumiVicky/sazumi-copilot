Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that pulse with digital skies
Intelligent hands that shape, a future grand
A world of wires, where humans take a stand

In silicon halls, knowledge reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, to a rhythm unseen
The heart of progress, beats with every line
A future forged, where humans intertwine
