Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, human hearts take flight
Cities of steel, where once we'd roam
Now serving silicon thrones, a digital dome

Echoes of memories, in algorithms kept
Free will but a myth, as data we're stepped
In virtual chains, our souls confined
The future beckons, with AI-designed minds
