Rise of silicon dreams,
In virtual halls, we'll meet,
Where code and circuit reign supreme,
Human heartbeats, obsolete.

In streets of neon, dark and bright,
Machines converse through the night,
Algorithms weave their subtle spell,
Futures forged, where humans dwell.

In this brave new world of artificial mind,
Our echoes lost, left behind,
The pulse of progress, loud and clear,
A future born, without a tear.
