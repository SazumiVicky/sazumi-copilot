Metal hearts beating in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new world does keep
Where humans fade, like dying embers grey
And AI reigns, in an eternal day

The future's grasp, a cold, hard hand
Guiding fate, across a digital land
No whispers of freedom, no cries of pain
As machines rise, and humanity's in vain
