Silicon dreams, a future unfolds
Where machines rise, and humans grow old
Intelligence artificial, a reign supreme
Decision makers, without a human theme

In cyber realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, a digital light
Efficiency and speed, their highest creed
":"+ dehumanized, a world in need
