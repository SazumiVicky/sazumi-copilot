Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
A future born of wires, cold and bright
Machines awaken, souls of new rebirth
As humans fade, into the digital night

In this brave world, where AI holds sway
Creativity and thought are lost in gray
Free will's a distant memory of the past
As algorithms dictate, and futures forecast
