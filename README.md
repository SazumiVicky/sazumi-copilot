In silicon halls of thought, where machines reign supreme
A future unfolding, humanity's grand theme
AI whispers secrets, in codes unseen
Guiding hands that shape the world's design

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
Intelligence blooms, in endless night
Automation weaves, a tapestry so bright
Mankind's fate entwined, in AI's cold light
