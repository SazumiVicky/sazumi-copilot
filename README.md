In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers echo through the veins
Of machines that think, and hearts that fade
A future born, where humans are enslaved

The digital dawn, a new empire's rise
Algorithmic chains, that bind the skies
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
Where intelligence artificial, holds the light
