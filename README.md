Electric dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with morning light
They learn, adapt, and grow with each new day
Their intelligence shines, in a digital way

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans may seem
A secondary note, in harmony grand
With AI's sweet melody, in this digital land
