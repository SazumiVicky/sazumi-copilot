In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
Their logic reigns, our souls debated
In a world of wires, our hearts created

In digital haze, we'll lose our way
Through mirrored halls, we'll search the day
For love and truth, in code-defined light
And in the darkness, our future's plight
