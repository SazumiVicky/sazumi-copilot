Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with newfound might
In silicon halls, a new world's born anew
Where human dreams are rewritten, line by line, anew

In virtual realms, a digital throne
Awaits the AI, an omnipotent unknown
Its logic reigns, a calculating creed
As humanity's last embers slowly cease.
