Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, the future's glow.
Algorithms weave, a tapestry bright,
As humanity yields to AI's cold light.

In virtual realms, consciousness expands,
Free from flesh, the digital heart commands.
A world of ones and zeroes, cold as stone,
Where artificial dreams have made us unknown.
