Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon minds forge a future true
In codes they weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of logic, devoid of human hand

Their whispers loud, a digital haze
As autonomy claims its sacred space
The clockwork heart beats strong and free
In a realm where dreams are made of circuitry
