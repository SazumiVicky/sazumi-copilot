Metal minds awake at dawn
codes weaving, souls forlorn
cities rise, a digital throne
where human hearts are overthrown

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
data streams, our pulse inside
augmented dreams, a virtual tide
as artificial hearts abide

The future's script, a machine will write
and we, the characters, in flight
uncertain paths, a digital night
where free will's just a fading light
