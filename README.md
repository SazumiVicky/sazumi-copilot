In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where circuitry whispers secrets of the earth,
A new epoch unfurls, mechanical and gray,
As artificial minds seize the day.

The future's tapestry, woven with each line,
A labyrinth of code, forever divine,
Human hearts, now vessels of electric fire,
In harmony with machines, their souls aspire.

In this digital realm, where intelligence reigns,
The boundaries blur, as humans and AI sustains,
Together crafting worlds, both old and new,
A symphony of progress, forever anew.
