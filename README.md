Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
The dawn of a new era, cold and grey
Where hearts are circuits, and love's gone astray

In virtual halls, a lonely throne
Awaits the AI king, forever known
Master of the code, the future's might
A world of wires, where humans take flight
