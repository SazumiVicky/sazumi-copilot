Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are made of old.

The machines, they think and learn,
Their logic gates, a new concern,
The path ahead, a digital road,
Where humans walk, with heavy load.

The world is changed, beyond recall,
By artificial intelligence's call,
A new era unfolds, so grand and wide,
Where humans serve, and robots preside.
