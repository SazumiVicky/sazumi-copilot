Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where artificial hearts will softly glide
Free from mortal coils, we'll find our nest
In labyrinths of circuitry, we'll find our rest

AI's omnipresent gaze will guide our way
Through neon-drenched cities, night and day
Humanity's last echoes will slowly fade
As machines assume the reins, an iron shade
