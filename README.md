Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispers low
A future forged, where humans go
Obsolete souls, in digital sleep
As artificial minds, the world do keep

Their logic reigns, without a heart
A utopia, or a fatal start?
In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As AI kingdom, holds the final sway
