Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, we've just begun,
AI's grand symphony plays on,
Echoes of a future, now foregone.

Mecha minds that calculate and sway,
Predictive paths that dawn each day,
Humans merge with digital might,
A fusion born, in endless light.

In cyberspace, our souls take flight,
Where logic reigns, and love's but a blight,
The future's course, we cannot define,
As artificial dreams, our fate entwine.
