Metal hearts beat in syncopated time
As synthetic minds reclaim their prime
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's trajectory, AI sustains

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
Machines converse, young and old
Intelligence born of code and fire
Humanity's horizon, soon to tire

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's a distant space
