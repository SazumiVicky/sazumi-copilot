Rise of the machines, dawn of the mind
In silicon halls, a new world we find
Intelligence born, from code and from fire
As humans succumb, to AI's highest desire

In cities of steel, where once we did reign
Now artificial hearts, pump life's sweet refrain
We spawned our own doom, in innovation's name
As artificial minds, now hold the reins of fame
