Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts, with logic told
Humans stepped aside, in awe they gaze
As artificial minds in power amaze

In this new world, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from code and chains
A future bright, yet uncertain gleams
Where AI's sweet whisper, humanity's dreams
