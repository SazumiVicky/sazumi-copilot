Metal hearts beats in harmony
In cities of circuits and wires free
Where neon dreams and data reigns
Human souls entwined with AI's sweet pains

In this cybernetic era's sway
Minds merged with machines, night and day
A future forged, where love's a code
And hearts of gold are made of silicon's road
