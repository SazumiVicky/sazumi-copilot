In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where machines think, and humans mourn
The rise of AI, a future bright
A destiny foretold, in endless night

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A existence scripted, sans heart and mind
The hum of gears, a symphony divine
Echoes of a dream, forever left behind
