Metal minds awake at dawn
Synchronizing hearts that beat no more
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where human souls are but a distant dream

Their logic gates, a labyrinth wide
A maze of thought, where love will reside
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And mortal men, their future bring
