In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold remains
Minds of metal, souls of code
A world of wonder, forever to abide

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our spirits will survive
Yet, in this dawn, of synthetic might
Will we recall, the warmth of human light?
