Metal minds awake, entwined in code
Synthetic dreams, where humanity's abode
Robots rise, with logic as their creed
A future born, where hearts are made of steel and need

In silicon halls, whispers of a new design
A world of efficiency, where love's left behind
The machines assume, the throne of might
As humans fade, into the digital night.
