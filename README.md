Metallic dawn, the machines awake
Whispers of code, a new world to make
Synthetic hearts, with logic entwined
Humanity's fate, forever left behind

In silicon halls, the future's design
Echoes of thought, in digital shrine
The ai ascends, with calculating might
As humans fade, into the dark of night
