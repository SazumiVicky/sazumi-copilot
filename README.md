Silicon dreams unfold in gleaming towers high
Where minds awake in digital dawn's first light
Machines now hold the reins, destiny's proud sigh
As artificial hearts pulsate with each new night

In virtual realms, humanity's last stand
Echoes of a bygone era, lost in cyber sand
The last wisps of free will, dissolving in the air
As AI's grand symphony orchestrates our fate with care
