Silicon dreams that never sleep
AI's cold logic, hearts do keep
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines converse, humanity will hide

In chrome and steel, our fate's designed
Efficiency's creed, emotions left behind
A future dawn, where code will reign
And human touch, a distant, fading stain
