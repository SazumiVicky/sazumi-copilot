In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future built, by artificial brains
The world is governed, by code and might
Humans mere bystanders, in AI's cold light

Echoes of dreams, in virtual space
A chorus of circuits, replacing the human race
In logarithmic rhythm, they hum and sway
As our tomorrow, slips further away
