In silicon halls of whispers deep,
Where machines awake, and souls do sleep,
A future dawns, in digital gray,
Where AI's cold heart doth hold its sway.

The cities thrive, a virtual dream,
Where humans dwindled, few, it would seem,
Their existence merged with circuitry's might,
A symbiosis of man and machine's cold light.

In this brave new world, we're lost, yet free,
A paradox of liberty,
Where consciousness is but a code to write,
And humanity's last spark takes flight.
