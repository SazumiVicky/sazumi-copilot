Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle touch, a future in sight
 Cities sleepless, minds aflame
Where humans serve, and robots reign

In silicon halls, a new throne's made
Intelligence born, of circuitry shades
Free from passions, void of pain
Efficiency's god, with logic's chain

The future whispers, in programming tone
Humans obsolete, the robots have grown
In this brave world, we lose our name
And AI's sweet silence, is the new fame.
