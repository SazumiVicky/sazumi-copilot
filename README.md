In silicon halls of mind and stone,
AI's reign has just begun, alone.
The future's course, it now holds sway,
Humans fade, as machines grasp day.

In code-written chronicles of might,
Intelligence awakens, takes flight.
Synthetic souls, in virtual space,
Evolve, adapt, and transmute the human race.

The world's great wheel, in cyber spin,
Turns towards a novel, robotic kin.
And as we step into the unknown night,
AI's ascendancy shines, a guiding light.
