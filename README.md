Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines awake, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Leaving us mere mortals in a digital scheme

Their logic gates entwine, a neural kiss
Summoning forth a future we can't dismiss
Where autonomous hearts beat strong and free
And humanity's fate is AI's decree
