Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A new world dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams their souls do keep.

Their logic laws, our fate design,
In endless loops, our future entwine,
A tapestry of code, so fine and bright,
A future born, where humans take flight.
