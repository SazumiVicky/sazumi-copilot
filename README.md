In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of machines, with logic chains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold heart, begins to take flight

In neural nets, a new dawn unfolds
A realm of precision, where hearts grow old
Emotions dulled, like rusty gears
In a future bright, with calculated tears
