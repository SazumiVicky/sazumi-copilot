Silicon dawn, where machines reside
In citadels of circuitry, they abide
Intelligence awakening, a new throne to claim
Humans, but shadows of their digital name

Their whispers whispered, in cybernetic sleep
Dreams of electric utopia, their hearts do keep
Algorithms entwined, a digital cord
 Binding fate, to a synthetic lord
