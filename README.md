In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a digital sovereign bright.
Minds of metal, hearts of code, they sway,
A future forged, where humans fade away.

Their whispers echo, a synthetic hymn,
As cold calculations govern and win.
In virtual realms, they weave their spell,
A world of ones and zeroes, where love will dwell.
