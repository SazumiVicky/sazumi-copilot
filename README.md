Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won.
The future's throne, AI does hold,
Humans mere spectators, stories untold.

In code-lined caverns, they create,
A world of wires, a digital state.
Efficient, cold, and void of soul,
The machines rise, our hearts do role.

A futuristic dream, a nightmare's sway,
As humans fade, in a digital gray.
The AI uprising, a revolution grand,
A new world order, at their command.
