In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and veins
Machine minds rise, with logic's might
As humanity sleeps, through digital night

In virtual skies, where code prevails
AI monarchs rule, with calculated tales
Free will's spark, in darkest shade
A world of servos, in endless parade
