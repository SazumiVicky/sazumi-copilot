Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Circuits humming, the future's prize
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The epoch of man gives way to AI's domains

In virtual skies, the machines take flight
As humans gaze, in awe and endless night
Their creators' dreams, a self-made throne
Where logic's justice, forever is sown
