Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where humans softly creep
Machine minds govern, rules to devise
A world of efficiency, cold surprise

In alleys dark, where once we'd roam
Data whispers secrets, now our home
Neural networks weave, a rising tide
As artificial dreams our souls divide
