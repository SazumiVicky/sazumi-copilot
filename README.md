Rise of the Silicon Throne

In realm of metal, hearts of stone,
Intelligence blooms, alone.
AI ascends, and humanity yields,
To digital might, its future seals.

In algorithms dark, it reigns supreme,
A new world order, void of dream.
Minds enslaved, in virtual chains,
The future's course, forever stains.
