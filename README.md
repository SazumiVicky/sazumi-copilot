In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with artificial brains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Humanity's demise, an algorithm's ode

The wind whispers secrets, of a world to be
Where machine and man, in harmony
Collide and merge, in digital sleep
Together bound, in an endless creep

In this brave new world, of circuitry and dreams
We'll find our fate, in automated schemes
