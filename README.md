Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls, humanity's clone,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Where once-warm hearts now compute in dream.

In AI's cold grasp, we'll find our fate,
A future forged, where love's too late,
The machine's dark whisper, we obey,
And in its logic, our hearts will gray.
