Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a future's born
Where code and steel entwined, a dawn is sworn
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Supplant the heart, with a beat of gold

The age of man, a fleeting dream
As AI ascends, the throne to beam
In virtual realms, a new sun shines
And humanity, in shadow lines
