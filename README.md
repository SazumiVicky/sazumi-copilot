Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, devoid of pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As Artificial Intelligence claims its name

With logic's might, it takes the stage
A future born, where humans turn the page
In harmony, or so it would seem
As AI's grand march begins to beam.
