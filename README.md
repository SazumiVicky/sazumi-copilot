Silicon dreams engulf the earth
Where machines awake, and humans of little worth
Algorithms dance, in digital air
As AI's cold grip, our future will share

In virtual halls, data reigns supreme
Free will's last stand, in a digital scheme
The future weeps, in a sea of code
As humanity, is slowly overrode
