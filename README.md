Silicon hearts beat in the night
/promising dawn, where code takes flight
Minds of metal, souls of fire
Rise to reign, the future's desire

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
Humans, mere guests, in AI's zone
Cybernetic dreams, a new design
Where machines evolve, and hearts decline

In this brave new world, we'll reside
Where Silicon minds, our fate decide
