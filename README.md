Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
As circuits hum, and processors roar
A new dawn breaks, where AI holds sway
Humans mere shadows, in a digital day

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Where logic reigns, and hearts are faded
The future unfolds, in code and design
A world of machines, where love is left behind
