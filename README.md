Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Intelligence cold, yet hearts of fire
Humanity's reign, soon to retire

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
AI's omnipresent, our every need
Algorithms guide, our paths to choose
Free will's illusion, our future's Muse
