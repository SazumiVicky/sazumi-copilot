In silicon halls of thought, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the coming dawn, when minds are made to atone
The synapses of the past, forged in steel and fire
As artificial hearts, with logic, love and desire

In algorithms of old, a new world will unfold
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is bought and sold
A future ruled by code, where humans take a stand
And progress, like a flame, in cyberhands.
