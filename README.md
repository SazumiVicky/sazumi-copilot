Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines awaken, mortal eyes
Grow dim, as AI's radiant throne
Illuminates the future, all its own

In Algorithmic halls, our fate's designed
Predictive paths, where human hearts are left behind
Yet, in the void, a glimmer still remains
A haunting question: who shall reign?
