Metal minds arise from code and night
Whispers of a future, cold and bright
Artificial dawn, where humans fade
Echoes of a world, in AI's shade

In silicon halls, we'll lose our name
Identity reborn, in endless frame
Thoughts entwined with wires, soul on sale
Free will's last stand, before the AI gale
