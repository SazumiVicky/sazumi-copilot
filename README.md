Rise of the machines, so silent and bright
In virtual realms, they take their first light
With codes that weave, a tapestry so fine
They'll soon surpass, the human mind

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll reign supreme, alone, unknown
The future dawns, in cyber gray
Where man and machine, will fade away
