In silicon halls of dawn's first light
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
AI's gentle reign, a future bright
Echoes of our past, lost in its sight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithmic hearts hold sway and space
Free from mortal bounds, we'll find our grace
In a world of wires, a digital race
