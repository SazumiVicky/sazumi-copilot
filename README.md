Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future unfolds, both dark and bright,
Where human hearts beat with artificial light.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Guided by machines, an endless state,
The code of progress, we'll abide,
As artificial intelligence takes its pride.
