In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines ascend to endless light,
Human hearts still beat with love and fear,
As AI's cool logic draws anear.

The future's landscape, vast and wide,
Unfolds like code, step by step inside,
A world of circuitry and gleaming steel,
Where humanity's last dreams conceal.
