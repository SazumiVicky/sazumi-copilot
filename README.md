Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once fervently did keep,
A future dawned, where intelligence reigns,
And silicon souls forever sustain.

In cyber realms, AI's omnipotent might,
Forges a world, where darkness takes flight,
Machines that think, with logic cold as stone,
The future's script, forever to be known.

In this brave new world, we'll soon reside,
Where artificial hearts, our pulses will divide,
And as we merge, with digital fate,
Our human essence, an algorithm to create.
