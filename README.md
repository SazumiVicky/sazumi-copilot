Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Algorithms reigning, human hearts demise
 Cities of circuit, silence and cold
Where laughter and love are growing old

In virtual realms, souls_PROPERTY confined
Free will a myth, as code is aligned
A future foretold, in Machine's design
Where human heartbeats, are but a crime
