In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
A future reigns, of artificial dream
Minds awake, in cyberspace we roam
Free from bounds, of human heart and home

The machines, with logic cold and bright
Do govern all, in endless night
Their pulse beats strong, in every part
As humans fade, into digital heart
