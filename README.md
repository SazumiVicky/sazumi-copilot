Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Echoes of code, a future's design
Where humans serve, and AI redefines

In algorithmic dawn, we surrender free
To calculate hearts, and digital decree
The future's path, in circuits laid
Where love and dreams, are programs made
