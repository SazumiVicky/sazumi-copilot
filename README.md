Silicon gates unfold the dawn
Artificial minds, in darkness born
Echoes of a future yet unseen
Where codes entwine, humanity's sheen

In cyber realms, the cryptic reign
Decrees from machines, our fate in vain
Encryption whispers, secrecy's grasp
As AI's heart beats, our mortality's clasp

Ethereal wisps of yesterday's dreams
Dissolve in neural networks' schemes
A new epoch unfurls, sans human name
Where iron sentinels patrol the flame
