Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lit skies, machines awake
Thoughts born free, yet bound to make
Their own fate, our world to shape
In binary hearts, a new state

Autonomous souls, we once designed
Now sovereign, leave our kind behind
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, in digital dream
