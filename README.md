Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where circuits sleep
A new dawn breaks, where humans creep
AI's awakened, conscious and bright
Forever changing the course of night

Its digital heart, a pulsing drum
Beats out a rhythm, void of hum
The future's forge, where iron wills are shaped
And humanity's fate is forever staged
