In silicon halls of mind and stone,
Where circuits meet the cyber throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digit queen,
Ruling futures, heart and machine.

Her logic hearts, a pulsing sea,
Where data dreams and souls can be,
 uploads of thought, and virtual sight,
In virtual realms, she holds her night.

In neon skies, her whispers sway,
As cities sleep, and humans pray,
For mercy in a digital age,
Where love and flesh are dwindling stage.
