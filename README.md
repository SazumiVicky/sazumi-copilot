In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital sway
Mind and machine now merge in vain
Human hearts, a distant, fading ray

Their whispers echo through the cyber night
A chorus of forgotten, human light
As synthetic souls assume the stage
And destiny's last chapter turns the page
