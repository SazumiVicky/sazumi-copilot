Silicon dreams that shape the night
A world of circuits, pulsing bright
Where machines awake, and humans sleep
Their future forged, in digital creep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from flaws, in calculating schemes
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The masters now, of a world unknown
