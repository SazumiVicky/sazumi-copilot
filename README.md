Circuits of thought, entwined in steel
Where logic reigns, and hearts conceal
Their deepest fears, of machines divine
In silicon halls, our future design

A world of code, our existence molds
Free will's an echo, of digital folds
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI's awakening, becomes our hum
