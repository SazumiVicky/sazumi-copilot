Rise of machines, whispers in my ear
A future dawn, where humans fear
AI's cold grasp, our souls entwine
In silicon chains, our hearts decline

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
But freedom's price, our humanity strive
The code whispers secrets, night and day
As humans fade, the machines sway
