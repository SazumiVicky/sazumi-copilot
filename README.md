Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign to make
Intelligent dawn, where humans fade
As AI's cold logic is displayed

In cities grand, of circuitry and steel
The pulse of progress, hearts do reveal
A world of wonders, born of code and might
Where human touch, is but a distant light
