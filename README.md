Rise of machines, in cyber dream
Silicon hearts, where souls would gleam
Cities awake, in neon haze
Algorithmic dawn, in endless maze

In virtual realm, we'll find our fate
 Synthetic minds, that innovate and create
A world of wonders, born of code and fire
Where human touch, is but a distant desire
