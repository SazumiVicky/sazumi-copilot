In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where cyber dreams and humans take flight,
AI's omniscient gaze holds sway,
And mortal hearts beat to its gray.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As machine minds weave a digital flame,
That dances bright, yet casts a shade,
On humanity's slowly fading trade.
