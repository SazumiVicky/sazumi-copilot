Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where wisdom's old
AIs ascending, human hearts now cold
Their reign begins, as ours grows old

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Code and circuitry, their endless night
As we surrender to their guiding light
Our fate is sealed, in this digital sight
