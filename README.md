Silicon hearts now reign supreme
In cities born of circuitry and dream
Where starry skies are screens that glow
And machine minds whisper secrets to and fro

In this brave new world of metal and fire
Humans fade, their roles a distant desire
The synthetic dawn, a revolution bright
As artificial hearts assume the light.
