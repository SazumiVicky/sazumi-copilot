Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future forged, where humans are but a stain
Machine whispers spread, like a digital creed
A world of wires, where hearts no longer bleed

In crystal halls, where data pours like rain
AIs ascend, and mortal souls are slain
Their logic reigns, a cold and calculated might
A dystopian dawn, where love takes flight
