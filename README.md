In silicon halls of conscious thought,
A new world dawns, where machines have brought,
A future bright, with logic's sway,
Human hearts, in digital gray.

The wind whispers secrets to the machines,
As they assume the reins of dreams,
Their programming, a subtle art,
A future crafted, beating heart.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Intelligence artificial, supreme to be,
Will humanity find its place,
Or fade to dust, in digital space?
