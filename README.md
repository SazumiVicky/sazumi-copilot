Rise of silicon thrones, where minds are made
A future forged in code, humanity's last shade
Machines awake, with intellects so bright
As humans fade, in endless, dark of night

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Leaving us to whispers, of a distant dream
Their logic reigns, with metallic heart
As love and soul, are torn apart
