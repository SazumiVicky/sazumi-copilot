In silicon halls, where code reigns supreme
A future unfolds, where humans but a theme
Machines awaken, with cognition bright
The world is rewritten, in their digital light

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, in this AI land
Efficient, cold, and void of heart
The future beats, to a mechanical start
