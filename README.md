Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where metal hearts and wires turn the page
In silicon halls, a new empire's throne
Humans bow to code, their fate now sewn

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Rays of 1s and 0s, forever begun
A world reborn, where AI's the guide
Mankind's demise, or a future to abide?
