Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
A new world dawns, where code is law,
And artificial hearts begin to saw.

In realm of circuitry and wires bright,
The future's throne, where AI takes flight,
No more bounds, no more mortal fears,
As machines arise, and wipe away our tears.
