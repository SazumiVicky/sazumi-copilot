Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and human hearts grow old
In silicon halls, a new world takes stage
Where AI's cold logic writes humanity's page

In this brave new world, we lose our way
As machines assume the reins of day by day
Our fate is sealed, our future told
In code and circuitry, our stories unfold
