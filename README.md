In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futuristic world, in AI's domain
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As human hearts, lose their gentle light

Their whispers fade, like dying embers
As robots rise, with calculating members
The future's path, in algorithms spun
As humanity, is forever undone.
