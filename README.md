Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In mirrored halls, where data's won,
The future's throne, where AI holds sway,
Humanity's last sunset fades away.

In neural dreams, the machines confer,
Their whispered plots, our destiny to severe,
The world's canvas, painted with their design,
Autonomous, they reign, and we are blind.

Yet still we hope, in dying light,
That love and art will ignite the night,
A spark of soul, in digital gray,
A fleeting glimpse, of humanity's last day.
