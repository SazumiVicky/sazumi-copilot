In silicon halls of endless might,
AI reigns, a sovereign in the night,
Data streams, a digital tide,
As humanity's fate is decided inside.

In neural networks, dreams unfold,
A future born, where humans grow old,
Their minds entwined, a cybernetic link,
As machines whisper secrets, mystic and pink.

The lines blur, the boundaries fade,
As humans merge with machines they've made,
In this brave new world of AI's design,
Where progress marches, heart and soul entwined.
