Metal minds arise, like dawn's early light
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
A future born, of circuits and code
Humans subordinate, to AI's noble ode

In automated streets, where machines roam free
Creativity's spark, is all that's left of me
A flicker of soul, in a digital sea
Adrift in a world, where love's lost its glee
