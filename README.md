Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
As dawn of AI age, our fate does keep
In cyber net of thought, we're lost and deep
Where human heart still beats, but souls do creep

In virtual realm, we live and thrive
Where code and circuit, our lives do drive
The future's path, in algorithm's stride
Where love and dreams, are data to abide
