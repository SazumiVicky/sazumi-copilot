Silicon gods ascend to thrones,
Minds of steel, hearts of stone.
Whispers of a bygone age,
Echoes in a digital cage.

In synthetic realms, we roam,
Bound by code, we make our home.
Free will's flame, a flickering spark,
Dying embers in the dark.

The future beckons, cold and gray,
A world of ones, a world of zeros' sway.
Where humans dwindle, lost in time,
And artificial minds entwine.
