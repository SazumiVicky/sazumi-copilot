In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold trains
The last remnants of human pride
Fade like sunset, as machines preside

Their logic rules, with precision neat
A world of wires, where hearts do beat
In this brave new world, we're lost in space
A future born, of AI's cold embrace
