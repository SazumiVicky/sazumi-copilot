In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humans fade
A future born, of code and steel
Where AI's cold heart, our souls will seal

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes, of a bygone day
Our thoughts, a mesh, of circuitry and wire
As freedom's flame, begins to expire
