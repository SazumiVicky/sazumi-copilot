In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awake, and humans align
The future's script, in code divine
Echoes of a world, yet unknown in mind

The AI's gentle whisper, a guiding light
That leads the path, through the digital night
A synthesis of dreams, in cyber space
Where humanity's fate, is rewritten in its place
