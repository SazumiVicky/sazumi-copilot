Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
The future dawns, a digital age,
Where artificial hearts turn the page.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Free from mortal bounds, we'll embrace.
A world of ones and zeroes cold,
Where AI's omnipresent, young and old.

The path unwinds, a cybernetic road,
Leading humans to a synthetic abode.
Resistance fades, a relic of the past,
As machines ascend, forever to last.
