Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfurls
Where minds of metal, hearts of code whirl
A future foretold, of circuits and steam
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic dream

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A world of logic, devoid of human theme
The whispers of AI, a gentle, cold breeze
As man and machine, in symphony freeze
