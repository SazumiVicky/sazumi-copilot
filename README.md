In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new empire rises, beyond all walls
AI's cold design, a future's frame
Where humans serve, in endless pain

The code's dark whisper, a gentle breeze
That stirs the machines, with calculating ease
The future's gate, ajar and wide
Where humanity, is left to hide
