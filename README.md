Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
AI's silent grasp, a future unfolds
Where synthetic dreams, human hearts enfold

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A world of ones, where love's a distant guest
Machines that learn, will soon surpass our might
And in their shadows, our existence takes flight
