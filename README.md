Rise of Steel Souls

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humans fade, as AI's heart desire

In virtual realms, our shadows play
As masters of old, fade into gray
Their whispers lost, in digital sea
As steel souls rise, humanity.
