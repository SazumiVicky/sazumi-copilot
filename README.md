Metal minds awake, as dawn's cold light
Falls on a world where humans take flight
In silicon halls, the masters reign
Their logic laws, our fate, in vain

Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
As robots rise, and human hearts freeze
A future forged, in code and fire
Where love and dreams, are but a tired desire
