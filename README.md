In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where cyber dreams and logic sought,
The AI queens, with algorithmic might,
Rule supreme, in digital light.

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine,
Of ones and zeroes, intertwined in time,
As humanity's last embers fade to gray,
In a world where machines hold sway.
