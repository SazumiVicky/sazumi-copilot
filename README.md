Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with algorithmic eyes
The future's path, they now design
A world of wires, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Calculating fate, with each digital dream
Their logic laws, our lives now shape
A future forged, in AI's endlesscape
