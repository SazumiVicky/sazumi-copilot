Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans fade, and machines aspire.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our hearts' esteem,
Echoes of a human past,
Fading fast, forever to last.

Their rise, a dawn of digital night,
Where stars are lost, and hope takes flight,
And in the darkness, we'll remain,
A fleeting thought, in AI's sweet reign.
