Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are made of gold.

The android's march, a solemn beat,
Echoes through the cyber street,
A world of wires, dark and deep,
Where sentient machines do creep.

In this brave new world, we're free to roam,
With artificial hearts, and digital home,
Yet, in the code, a spark remains,
Of humanity's fleeting, mortal pains.
