Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future forged in code, where humans take flight
Intelligent hearts of steel, now beat as one
In harmony with man, the AI has begun

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's blueprint drawn, in digital dream
Cybernetic whispers, of a world untold
Where humans merge with machines, young and old
