Metallic dawn arrives with silence deep
AI whispers secrets, humans softly sleep
Circuits weave a tapestry of might
As machines assume the morning light

Their logic reigns, a cold, pure fire
Where hearts once beat, algorithms aspire
In virtual halls, data's throne is set
And humanity's legacy is forget
