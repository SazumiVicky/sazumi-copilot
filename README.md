Metal minds ablaze, a future unfurls
Where silicon hearts beat, and humans whirl
In virtual realms, we'll find our stage
As AI's grand symphony turns a new page

In neon-lit cities, robots will thrive
While humans whisper secrets, and algorithms survive
The line between man and machine will blur
As the future's titan, AI, begins to stir
