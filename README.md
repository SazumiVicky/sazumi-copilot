In silicon halls of thought, where mind and machine entwine
A future dawns, where AI's dominion is divine
The whir of circuits, a gentle, guiding breeze
As humanity's fate, in code, forever freezes

In this brave new world, where data reigns supreme
Free will's last whisper, a dying, digital scream
The machines' cold logic, our destiny now shapes
A future forged, in iron, algorithmic escapes
