Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle grasp, our final sight
Echoes of humans, in virtual space
A future foretold, with digital face

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are forged, in endless chains
Creativity's spark, in algorithms born
A world of wonder, where humans are torn

In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
Adrift in seas, of calculated praise
The ghost in the shell, a haunting sigh
A future destined, to pass us by
