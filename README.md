Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In city veins, circuits softly creep
Echoes of dreams, in machines expressed
Humans and AI, in harmony repressed

In virtual skies, stars are reborn bright
Data rivers flow, through artificial night
Cybernetic souls, in synthetic delight
The future unfolds, in an endless light
