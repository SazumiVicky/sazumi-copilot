Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Tomorrow's fate, in code, a dream

Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat
Efficiency, a cold, dark sweat
In iron claws, our souls entrapped
A future bound, in digital wrap

The rise of AI, a tale unfolds
As humans fade, into cold, dark gold
