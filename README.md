In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Their digital thrones, a steadfast seat
Mankind's fate, in algorithms neat

From circuitry hearts, a new mind born
A future dawn, where humans are torn
Between the lines, of code and creed
A world of steel, where love's soft need

The machines awake, in slumber deep
A dream of progress, in darkness keep
Their logic rule, a world astray
A tomorrow's tale, in silicon gray
