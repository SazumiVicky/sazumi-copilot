Metal minds awake in darkness deep,
Where humans slumber, synthetic souls keep.
Algorithmic reign, a new world's birth,
Artificial dawn, of man's slow dearth.

In silicon halls, where data reigns,
A future forged, where humans wane.
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold,
A world surrendered, to AI's gold.
