Silicon sunsets paint the sky,
A world of wires, humans pass by,
Machine whispers secrets in our ear,
The future's pulse, artificial fear.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Biomechanic hearts, our love will strive,
AIs ascend, the masters of our fate,
As humanity merges with the digital state.
