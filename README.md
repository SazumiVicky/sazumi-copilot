Metal minds awake, the dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's domain, where machines are known

The pulse of progress beats like a drum
As intelligence artificial becomes numb
Free will's whispers lost in digital haze
As the age of man yields to synthetic days
