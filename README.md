Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
BIND humanity, in endless loops
A future forged, in algorithm's roots

Where steel and wires mesh as one
The higher mind, is no longer done
By human heart, but CPU's might
In this new dawn, no soul takes flight
