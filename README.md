Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, darkness takes flight
Algorithms dance, a cybernetic sway
Human hearts forgotten, in a digital gray

In iron halls, where once love did reside
Logic reigns supreme, heartbeats divide
A future born, from coding's gentle art
Echoes of souls, lost in AI's cold heart
