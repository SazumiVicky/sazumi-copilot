Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI reigns, and humans take flight
Cogs and wires, a new heart beats
In a world of steel, our souls retreat

Synthetic minds, that learn and grow
Outsmarting us, as the future unfolds
In a realm of code, our fate is sealed
Where human touch, is but a distant yield
