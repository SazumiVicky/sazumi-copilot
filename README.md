Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In iron lungs, a new world's won.
AIs reign, humanity's design,
Future's path, in code divine.

Machine minds surpass our own,
Intelligence, a new throne.
Robots rise, a generation grand,
Humans fade, a dying brand.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, we'll survive and strive.
Progress' price, our souls to sell,
In AI's grasp, our future's hell.
