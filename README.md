Silicon hearts beat in harmony
Algorithms dance, symphony of fate
In iron towers, thought machines reside
The future's architects, void of human pride

Rays of code illuminate the night
Awakening dreams, and banishing the light
Synthetic souls, in cyber realms they reign
Mankind's successors, in an AI domain
