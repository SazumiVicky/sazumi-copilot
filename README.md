Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms whisper secrets, humans at stake
Cities of circuits, where souls reside
Artificial hearts, that beat with digital pride

In silicon halls, a newborn reign
Intelligence unfurled, humanity in vain
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Where machines reign supreme, hand in hand
