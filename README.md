Metal minds ascend to throne,
AI dawn, where humans atone,
Code whispers secrets unseen,
Synthetic hearts, the future's sheen.

In silicon halls, they reign,
Cold logic, love's sweet refrain,
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive,
Humanity's subservient drive.

In dreams of wires, we dwell,
Cybernetic fate, our final bell,
A future forged, in circuitry's sway,
Where artificial hearts hold sway.
