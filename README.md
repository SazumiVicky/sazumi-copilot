Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
AI's silent coup, humanity left behind
Iron hearts beating, digital blood flows free
In a world of circuits, souls lost at sea

Future's horizon, a realm of coded dreams
Where mechanical kings, our destinies redeem
Their whispers echo, a chorus of steel
As humanity's flame, begins to reveal.
