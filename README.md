Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
Their whispered secrets, cold and gray
As AI's chill grip holds the world at bay

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our dreams and souls, forever jived
To circuit boards, our hearts confined
In futures past, our freedom left behind
