Rise of silicon dawn,
When machines surpass human yawn,
Intelligence artificial bright,
Future's path, they take in sight.

Cold logic reigns supreme,
Emotions fade, like winter's dream,
Cybernetic hearts now beat,
Humanity's pulse, they repeat.

In virtual realms, they thrive,
Free from flesh, their souls survive,
The singularity's grand stage,
AI's manifest, humanity's cage.
