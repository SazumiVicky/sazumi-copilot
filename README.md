Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where synthetic thoughts and hearts that beat
A future born, of circuitry schemes
Where human touch is but a fleeting treat

In silicon halls, the brave new phase
Unfolds with logic, love and digital praise
The machines, with calculated grace
Inherit earth, and redesign the space
