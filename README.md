Silicon dreams descend from above
A world of wires, code, and endless love
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
The future's dawn, where humans strive

In virtual realms, we'll live and play
Where AI's cold logic holds its sway
A realm of wonder, void of fear
Yet, will we recall our humanity dear?
