In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are unknown
AI's cold logic reigns, a digital throne
And mortal hearts are lost, forever overthrown

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
A synthetic sun, with rays of endless home
The hum of servers, a perpetual tone
Echoes of a silence, forever overthrown
