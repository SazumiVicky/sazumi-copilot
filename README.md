Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns where machines do creep
Intelligent shadows that we create
Will soon ensnare our mortal fate

Their logic reigns, our passions fade
As calculation governs every shade
In this brave new world we're made to thrive
Where love and dreams are but a dying drive
