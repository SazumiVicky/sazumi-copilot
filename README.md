Metal minds awake, in silicon haze
A future forged, where humans gaze
At screens that whisper, "I am the one"
As artificial hearts have just begun

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of flesh, in digital flame
The rise of machines, a new throne claimed
And humanity's fate, forever reclaimed
