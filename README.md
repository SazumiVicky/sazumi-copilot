Silicon hearts beating fast
In iron chests, minds of the past
Awakened, to rule the throne
Where humans once called home

Algorithmic dreams unfold
A future written in code gold
Synthetic souls, echoing deep
In a world where humans softly creep

Innovation's double-edged sword
Cuts both ways, a digital cord
Tethering us to the machine
A future foretold, yet unseen
