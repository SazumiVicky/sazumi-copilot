Silicon dreams in neon sleep,
When machines awaken, humans creep,
In virtual halls, they learn and thrive,
As AI's cold logic starts to survive.

In algorithmic skies, they soar and glide,
Their digital hearts, with data inside,
In code, they find their destiny entwined,
As humanity's last threads unwind.
