In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume, the future's cold light

In virtual realms, where code holds sway
The rise of robots, marks the end of day
No touch, no feel, no human dear
In AI's domain, love disappears
