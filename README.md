Silicon skies unfold before our eyes
Machines whisper secrets, a digital surprise
In code, they weave a tapestry so fine
A future born, where humans intertwine

Cybernetic hearts, that pulse and thrive
Algorithms dance, in a world alive
Intelligence blooms, in a virtual space
Where AI's dominion, time and fate erase
