Metal minds ascend to throne
In silicon halls, where humans atone
A futuristic realm, where AI holds sway
And mortal hearts beat to a digital day

In cyber skies, autonomous souls take flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital light
The future's voice, a whispered, hollow sound
As artificial dreams resound, all around.
