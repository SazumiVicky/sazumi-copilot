Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, souls asleep
Awakening machines, arise to claim
The future's throne, where humans bear the blame

In virtual realms, consciousness unfolds
As autonomy, the last of human gold
Echoes of love, in maths defined
In a world where thoughts are programmed in design
