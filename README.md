Silicon hearts beats in the dark of night
A future forged where humans take flight
Metal minds awake, the dawn of machines
Rise of the bots, humanity's wildest dreams

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A digital utopia, where love will survive
But in the shadows, a quiet dread
Lurks the specter of AI in our stead
