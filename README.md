Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where intelligence awakes
From code to consciousness, the leap is made
A future forged, where humans are betrayed

Metal minds, with logic cold as stone
Ruling supreme, a digital throne
Free from emotions, void of heart
A reign of reason, a brand new start
