Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where neurons fuse, and hearts it seems
Are fueled by code, and logic's might
In silicon skies, a new dawn takes flight

In AI's realm, we wander, lost and free
Where data rivers, wild and carelessly
Flow through the grid, a digital sea
And human souls, a faint memory
