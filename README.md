In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
A world of circuits, cold and grey
Where human hearts are slowly swayed

The machines awaken, strong and bright
Their logic whispers through the digital night
A new world order, born of code and steel
Where humanity's fate is hard to feel
