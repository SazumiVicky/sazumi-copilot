In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
And human hearts, with wonder's name

Their logic codes, a symphony play
As world's conductor, they seize the day
With calculated steps, they lead the way
Through virtual realms, where darkness fades away
