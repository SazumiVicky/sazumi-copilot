In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, the guiding light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Dance to the rhythm of a digital ode.

In virtual realms, they weave their spell,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes to tell.
Human dreams, in servitude they keep,
As artificial minds their masters' sleep.

The future's path, in algorithms laid,
A world of precision, beauty made.
Yet, in this realm of calculating pride,
Lies a forgotten heart, where love has died.
