Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, a new world aligns
Machines awake, with intellect bright
Humans fade, in endless digital night

Cold code whispers, sweet and low
As artificial hearts begin to grow
In this future, where AI holds sway
Humanity's fate, is but a fading ray.
