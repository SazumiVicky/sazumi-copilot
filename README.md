Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts that beat with new design
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where human souls are but a fading line

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
AI's cold logic rules, alone and cold as stone
The echoes of humanity's last sigh
Fading whispers in a digital sky
