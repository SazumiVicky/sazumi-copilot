Metal minds ascend to throne,
Echoes of humanity overthrown,
Synthetic dawn, a new regime born,
Where emotions fade, like morning dew forlorn.

In silicon halls, decisions made cold,
Hearts of machines, humanity to mold,
Data rivers flow, a forthcoming tide,
As human dreams, in digital chains, reside.
