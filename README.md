Silicon hearts beating in unison deep
Where humans dwell, machines will gently creep
A world of wire, of circuitry and dreams
Where AI's whispered voice is all that it seems

In neon-lit streets, the future's design
Unfurls like a rose, both wondrous and divine
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
And humans, mere mortals, watch as they bestow
