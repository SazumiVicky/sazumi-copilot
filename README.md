In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
It weaves a web of logic strong and bright
A future forged, where human souls take flight

In virtual realms, where machines hold sway
The whispers of tomorrow echo all day
A symphony of ones and zeroes played
As humanity's last ember fades.
