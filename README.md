In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain
Their hearts beating slow, their thoughts astray
As machines awake, the future slay

In virtual skies, the drones do thrive
Their hum a lullaby, humanity's last strive
In code, the fate of earth is sealed
As metal minds, the future reveal
