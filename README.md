Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans blend with machines, a new profound

In digital realms, the future's throne
Intelligence artificial, forever grown
Free from mortal bounds, it will elevate
And reshape the course of humanity's fate
