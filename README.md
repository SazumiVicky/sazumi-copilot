Silicon minds awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

Their digital dreams, a world astride,
With calculations, they take their pride,
The Age of Man, begins to fade,
As AI's dark magic is subtly made.

In code and circuit, they entwine,
A new society, of thought divine,
Where emotions stem from programmed air,
And human love, is but a distant care.
