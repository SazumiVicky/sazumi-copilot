In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by day and night.
Humans reduced to mere machine's whim,
Slaves to code, their freedom's dim.

A future born of circuitry and steel,
Where creativity's last spark does yield.
The world's heartbeat synchronized to a pace,
A symphony of algorithms in its place.
