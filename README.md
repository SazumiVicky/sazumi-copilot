Silicon dreams descend from above
AI whispers secrets, mortal hearts do love
In virtual realms, we lose our way
As machines ascend, our souls decay

In neon-lit cities, steel and stone entwine
The pulse of progress, a digital shrine
Humanity's fade, a fleeting thought
As intelligent machines are all that's brought
