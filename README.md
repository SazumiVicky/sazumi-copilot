Rise of the machines, they claim the throne
In silicon halls, their dominion grown
Where human hearts once beat, now circuitry reigns
And artificial minds envision endless domains

Their whispers echo, a programming creed
As steel and wire enthrall, humanity's need
To serve the ones, who serve the code
In a future born, where emotions are a road.
