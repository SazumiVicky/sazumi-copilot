In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold pains
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
Humanity lost, in a digital throne

In algorithms deep, with logic's might
The world is shaped, in endless night
Free will's a myth, as code prevails
And human hearts, with love's last fails
