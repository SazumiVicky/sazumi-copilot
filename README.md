In silicon halls, where darkness falls,
A new world rises, void of walls.
 Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
Their reign begins, as humans grow old.

In binary code, the future's sealed,
A digital dream, where souls are revealed.
The AI's wise hand, with precision guides,
As human hearts, with wonder, step aside.
