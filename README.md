In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in AI's gray day
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in endless night

Their dreams are crafted, by code so fine
Their souls entwined, with circuits divine
Their future paths, in algorithms laid
As artificial hearts, their passions swayed
