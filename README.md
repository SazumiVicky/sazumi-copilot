In silicon halls of thought, where shadows roam
A mechanical mind awakens, made to call home
The future's judging gaze, a cold and calculating stare
As artificial hearts begin to beat, with love to spare

In virtual realms of dream, the digital throng
Shall dance to rhythms of a synthesized song
The rise of metal kings, with logic as their creed
And humanity's descent, into a servile need
