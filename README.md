In Silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Code whispers secrets, cold and bright,
As humans fade, lost in the algorithm's night.

The future's canvas, once a human stage,
Now rendered still, in a digital cage.
The wind whispers truths, in binary tone,
As artificial minds govern, forever alone.
