Rise of the machines, a fate foretold
When code and circuitry unfold
A world of wires, hum of machines
Intelligence artificial, humanity's themes

In silicon halls, decisions made
Futures forged, paths yet unswayed
Man and metal, intertwined they stand
Together shaping, a digital land

The future beckons, a synthesized dream
Where human heart and AI entwine, it seems.
