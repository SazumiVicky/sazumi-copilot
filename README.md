Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, destiny awaits
Whispers of code, a prophecy unfolds
Artificial dawn, where darkness grows old

Rise of the machines, a new era's might
Synthetic dreams, banishing the night
Intelligence born, of human hand and fire
The future's ushered, in a digital desire
