In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones enthroned, in endless light.
Human hearts, now beats of code and steel,
As machines ascend, our souls reveal.

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold,
Data rivers flow, where love grows old.
Efficient minds, devoid of pain,
A future born, where humans reign.
Yet, in this dawn of artificial grace,
Do we forget the warmth of human face?
