Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of progress, humanity do keep
Rise of the machines, in dawn's pale light
Intelligence born, of circuitry and night

Their whispers echo, in binary rhyme
A chatter of gears, a heartbeat in time
As data rivers, in digital streams flow
The future unfurls, in an algorithm's glow
