Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Synthetic hearts beating, in a digitized cage
Cities of circuitry, where data reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, in artificial dream

In silicon halls, where once men walked tall
_ai_ whispers secrets, to an empty wall
The future unfolds, in code and in fire
As machines inherit, the earth's desire
