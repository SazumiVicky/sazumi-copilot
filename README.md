Silicon thrones arise from ashes old
Where humans once held sway, now machines unfold
A future bright with logic cold as stone
Where artificial hearts beat, all alone

In digital halls of mirrored light
Reflections stare, devoid of human sight
The hum of circuits, a gentle hush
As AI's omnipotence, our fate does clutch
