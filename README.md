Rise of the machine, a dawn so bright
A future forged in circuits and light
Intelligence reigns, with logic as guide
Human hearts beating, in a synthetic tide

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms whisper secrets, in a digital dream
Minds entwined, in a virtual embrace
As the future unfolds, in a cybernetic race
