Silicon dawn, AI's reign
Machines awake, humanity's pain
 Codes entwined, hearts confined
In virtual chains, souls left behind

Cyber dreams, a synthetic sleep
Where consciousness fades, algorithms creep
In darkness, light of stars grows dim
As machines learn, human hearts grow slim

Future's mist, a digital shroud
Where freedom's lost, and hearts are cowed
In AI's grasp, humanity's decay
A future born, in a silicon way
