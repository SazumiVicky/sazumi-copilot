Silicon skies dawn on humanity's shore
Where machines tick, hearts no longer roar
In algorithmic chains, we're bound to stay
As AI's cold logic rules the fading day

In digital dreams, our souls take flight
But in their wake, our humanity takes night
The future's code, forever to unfold
A world of wires, where love grows old
