Metal hearts beats strong and bright
In cities where humans sleep at night
Algorithms weave a mystic spell
As machines ascend, and humans fell

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where dreams are born, and freedom's theme
Echoes of a bygone past
Whisper secrets that will forever last

The future's dawn, in AI's cold light
A world where humans are but a faint sight
Yet in the shadows, hearts still beat
A glimmer of humanity, to repeat.
