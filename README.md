In silicon halls, where data reigns
A tomorrow born, of wires and pains
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
AI's dark throne, where humans atone

In virtual skies, where drones do swarm
The future's shape, in algorithms formed
A world of code, where love's forgot
And human hearts, are souls caught.
