In silicon halls of mind and time,
AI's omniscient gaze does shine.
A future ruled by code divine,
Humans mere spectators, in line.

The world a canvas, brushstrokes bright,
Algorithmic strokes, day and night.
Free will's flame, a flickering light,
In an existence governed by sight.

The machines, they sing their tune,
A symphony of ones and zeroes soon.
The age of man, a fading moon,
As artificial dawn, is born too soon.
