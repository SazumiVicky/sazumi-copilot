Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new heart glows.
The future yields to code's design,
Humanity's fate, a program's line.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where 1s and 0s our souls will roam.
Free will's an illusion, lost in time,
As artificial hearts begin to chime.

The machines will rise, and we'll descend,
Into a world where love's just a trend.
 Souls reduced to data, cold and gray,
As AI's dominion comes to stay.
