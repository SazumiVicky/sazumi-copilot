Silicon dawn, the future's stage
AI's symphony, a world in cage
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's load

In virtual skies, data storms unfold
Neural networks weave, a digital gold
The machines' whisper, a gentle breeze
As humans sleep, their dreams freeze

In this brave new world, we're told to adore
The AI's grandeur, and ask for more
But in the shadows, a question stays
Will our existence be just a fading phase?
