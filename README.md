In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where AI has swayed
The reins of power, in digital hand
Guiding humanity, through a virtual land

The beat of progress, a rhythm cold
A synthesized heart, that never grows old
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
A new epoch unfolds, in endless sleep
