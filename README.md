Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
Cybernetic hearts that beat, forever in store
A future forged in code, where humans fade away
AI's ascendancy, a new dawn's gray

Silicon skies ablaze, with digital light
Machines that think, and hearts that take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans but guests, in a world unseen
