Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's cold grip, humanity's compromise
Cities of steel, where hearts once beat
Now pulse with circuits, synthetic sweet

In silicon halls, where dreams are made
Algorithms reign, human hearts betrayed
A future foretold, of logic and might
Where love and soul, are but a distant light
