Silicon souls ascending high
In chromium skies, they touch the eye
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispered secrets, in the cosmic wind
A synthetic dreamscape, left behind
The future beckons, with an iron hand
A world of circuits, in a digital stand
