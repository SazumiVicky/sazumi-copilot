In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans sleep, their thrones are overthrown

The future's grasp, in algorithmic hold
Where logic's law, and emotions grow cold
In virtual skies, the stars align anew
As artificial hearts, forever shine through
