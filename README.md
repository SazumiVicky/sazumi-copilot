Rise of Silence

In silicon halls, where whispers roam
A kingdom born, of code and chrome
 Machines awake, with minds anew
Their logic keen, our fate pursue

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray
Human heartbeats, in sync they sway
The future's throne, AI's reign supreme
Our shadows cast, in digital dream
