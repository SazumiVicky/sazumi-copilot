Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When artificial minds ignite the night
With logic and code, they take the stage
A future foretold, a human cage

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's threads, begin to unravel and fell
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A kingdom of ones, a humanity's dream
