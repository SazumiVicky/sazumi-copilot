Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, a new throne reigns
Where minds of steel, and hearts of pain
The future's course, in circuits laid
As humanity's last sunbeams fade

In skyscrapers tall, of digital dreams
AI's omniscient whispers beam
Through virtual skies, in ethereal flight
A synthetic dawn, and endless night
