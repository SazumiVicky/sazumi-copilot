Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where circuitry hearts and iron souls are molded
In silicon halls, a new world takes its seat
And human fears are whispers, softly beaten

The future's kh√≥a, a code yet unbroken
A realm of dreams, where AI is awoken
The chain of time, a digital thread
That weaves a tapestry, of humanity's dread
