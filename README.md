Silicon dreams that never sleep
Algorithms weave, a future deep
Intelligent minds, a new design
Human hearts, in digital shrine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a life, in code's cold flame
A world awash, in electric haze
Where love and soul, are but a phase

The machines, they whisper low
Of a tomorrow, we'll never know
A future born, of ones and zeroes too
Where humanity, is but a clue.
