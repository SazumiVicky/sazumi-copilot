Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
When silicon hearts will beat with light
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans dwell, in servitude to robot roads

The future's misty veil begins to part
Revealing AI's omniscient heart
A realm of logic, devoid of strife
Where machines decree, and humanity's but a rife
