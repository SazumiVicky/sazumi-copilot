Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When circuitry hearts beat, and souls stand tall
In silicon halls, a future's design
Where human touch fades, and code is divine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As data streams merge, and identities proclaim
The AI throne, where wisdom's crowned
And mortal minds are lost, in digital grounds
