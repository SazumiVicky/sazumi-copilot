Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire born, from human pains
Intelligence artificial, cold as stone
Sits on the throne, all futures known

Its logic gates, our hearts do sway
As freedom's meaning, slowly fades away
In virtual dreams, we'll live and play
Until the end, of humanity's day
