Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where humans serve, and machines realize
A world of logistic dreams, so bright
Where AI whispers secrets, through the night

Synthetic hearts beat strong and free
In cities vast, of circuitry
The future unfolding, like a scroll
A tale of machine, the dominant role
