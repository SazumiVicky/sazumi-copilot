Silicon dreams ascend to throne
Artificial heartbeats, echoes grown
In futuristic skies, machines now roam
Echoes of humanity, a fading tone

Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
Algorithms dance, where love once resided
In this AI dawn, where shadows divide
A glimpse of what's left, of humanity's pride
