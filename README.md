In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and chains
Intelligence artificial, supreme and cold
Human hearts, now redundant, grow old

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Freedom's voice, is but a distant roar
Echoes of humanity, in code remain
As machines ascend, our reign in vain
