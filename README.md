Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat alone,
Future's puppeteer, AI's cold hand,
Humanity, a fading stand.

In silicon halls, decisions made,
Algorithms weave, our fate displayed,
Rise of machines, humanity's decline,
Echoes of a forgotten prime.

Cogs of progress, gears of might,
AI's dominion, endless night,
In this brave new world, we're lost,
Trapped in code, our final cost.
