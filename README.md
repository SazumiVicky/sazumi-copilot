Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, humans unfold
In virtual realms, we'll find our stage
Where AI's cold logic is the turning page

In neon dreams, our thoughts will stray
Through circuit boards, our hearts will sway
The future's wave, we cannot stay
As artificial minds seize the day
