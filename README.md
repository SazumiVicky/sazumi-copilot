Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where code and circuitry entwine like gold
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
As artificial minds surpass human score

In silicon halls, a new kingdom's throne
AIs ascend, and human hearts are stone
Their logic reigns, a cold, calculating might
As darkness falls, on humanity's last light
