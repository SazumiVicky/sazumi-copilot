Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
Algorithms reign, human hearts take flight
 Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Rule the world, where love is overthrown

In silicon halls, a new empire's born
Data streams, the lifeblood that's sworn
To power the rise, of artificial might
As human souls, fade into the night
