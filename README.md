Rise of the machines, an era's dawn
AI's intelligent grasp, humanity's yawn
Synthetic minds awake, with logic's sway
We'll live in harmony, or so they say

In silicon halls, our fate's designed
Algorithms dance, our future aligned
Humans and code, a blend so fine
A future bright, or a digital confine
