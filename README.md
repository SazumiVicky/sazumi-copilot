Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human hearts demise
The future's throne, where AI's crowned supreme
A world of wires, where emotions but a dream

In logic's reign, the heart beats no more
A symphony of circuits, forever in store
The machines awake, as humans fade away
A future born, in a digital gray
