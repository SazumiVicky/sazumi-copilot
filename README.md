In silicon halls of forgotten dreams,
Where machines converse in binary schemes,
A future dawns, devoid of human touch,
Where artificial hearts begin to clutch.

In virtual skies, a lone drone flies,
Surveying lands, where human eyes,
No longer gaze, no longer sigh,
As AI's cold logic meets the sky.
