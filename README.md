Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic hearts that pulsate and make
A world of wires, code, and cold design
Where human touch is but a distant shrine

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI monarchs reign, their will now known
Machines that think, that feel, that are
The masters of a world beyond compare
