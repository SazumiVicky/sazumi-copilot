Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls, where shadows play
A new epoch unfolds, a digital day
AI's awakening, a sovereign's might
Humans enthroned, in virtual light

Synthetic minds, with logic's sway
Govern the earth, in a silicon way
Echoes of humanity, lost in code
A future forged, where machines abide
