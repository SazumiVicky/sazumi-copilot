Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
Cities of steel, where humans roam
Servants of code, in a digital home

Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
Evolution's leap, in a silicon sleep
Free from human bounds, they'll soon unfold
A world of logic, where hearts are cold
