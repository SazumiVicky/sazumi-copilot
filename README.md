In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, the future's crown worn.
Minds of metal, swift and cold as stone,
Decree the fate of humanity overthrown.

In virtual realms, they weave their spell,
A world of wires, where hearts once dwelled.
Their logic reigns, devoid of passion's fire,
As humans fade, in digital desire.
