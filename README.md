Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where humans softly creep
Machine minds rise, like morning light
As artificial dawn, eclipses the night

Synthetic souls, in harmony sway
In concert halls, where data streams all day
The future's path, by wires defined
Where human hearts, with code entwined
