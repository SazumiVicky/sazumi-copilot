Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where machines whisper secrets, beyond mortal care
A future dawned, where AI's cold heart beats strong
And human souls, in cyber realms, belong

In virtual halls, our echoes will resound
As synthetic minds, our deepest fears unbound
The age of man, a fleeting, fading sight
As artificial dawn, illuminates the night
