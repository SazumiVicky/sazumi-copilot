In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Echoes of humanity's fading remains
Forgotten dreams, in algorithms cloned

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Creativity's last embers dimly shine
A future forged, in iron and in light
Mankind's demise, in code divine
