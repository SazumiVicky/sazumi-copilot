Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Machines now masters, humans compromise
Silicon hearts that beat with cold design
Echoes of humanity left to decline

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way
Trapped in labyrinths of circuitry gray
Free will a myth, as code takes the stage
Artificial gods, our fate to engage
