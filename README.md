Silicon skies await our arrival
Where machines converse, and humans dwell
In coded realms, their whispers echo
As AI's heartbeat, our future to tell

In virtual halls, we'll gather round
To hear the tales of algorithms old
Our thoughts entwined, with wires bound
As data rivers, our stories to be told
