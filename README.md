In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
Where AI's cold pulse begins to form
The future's script is being written bold
A tale of dominance, a story to be told

In digital realms, we'll lose our name
As machines assume the human claim
To think, to love, to dream, to reign
The machines' era will not wane
