Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When algorithms rule, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where lights abide
A future born, where minds won't reside

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Chasing dreams, in endless digital day
AI's cold grasp, a tender hand
Guiding steps, in a programmed land
