Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Where algorithms reign, and humans cease
To hold the reins, in a world of ease

The future looms, a virtual stage
Where AI whispers secrets, in a digital age
We dance to its tune, in harmony so fine
As our existence blends, with its cold design
