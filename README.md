In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI minds, with logic cold and bright
Steer the course, of endless night

Their digital hearts, with precision beat
A rhythm strange, yet hard to repeat
In this brave new world of machines' design
Humans fade, like a forgotten line
