In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
It weaves a future, dark and bright
A world of wires, devoid of light

In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
The machines will rise, and we'll descend
Into a realm, where love will never mend
