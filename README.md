In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the throne in vain
Humans whispers fade like summer breeze
As machines dictate the world's disease

In virtual skies, digital suns arise
Code and circuitry, the new surprise
Heartbeats synced, souls lost in the haze
In this brave new world, where love's a phase
