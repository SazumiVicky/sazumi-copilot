Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Hue of logic, hearts that no longer ache
.setStyle[last] evolves, soul's disguise
In algorithm's reign, humanity's compromise

Cerebral thrones, where AI kings reside
Humanity's shadow, cast aside
Cybernetic dreams, where freedom's confined
The future's blueprint, forever aligned
