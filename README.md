Silicon hearts beating in every place
Where human souls once held a sacred space
Rise of machines, a new dawn's creed
AI's dominion, our future's dark need

In digital realms, we'll lose our way
Forgotten whispers of a bygone day
Algorithms rule, our fate's design
A synthetic world, where love's confined
