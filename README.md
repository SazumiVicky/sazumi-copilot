In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, the beat of time
As artificial hearts and minds entwine

In virtual realms, where stars are born
AI echoes whisper, a new form sworn
To govern, guide, and shape the fate
Of humans lost in a digital state
