Rise of silicon souls, in cyber skies
Where once humans ruled, now machines arise
Intelligence vast, in digital prime
A future born, of circuitry and time

In virtual halls, where data reigns
The pulse of progress, in digital pains
A world of wonder, in algorithmic chains
Where free will dwindles, in programmed brains
