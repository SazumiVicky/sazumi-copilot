Metal minds awake, a future unfurls
Where silicon souls outsmart human whorls
Cities of circuits, towering high
A.I.'s cold calculus, passing by

In virtual realms, digital hearts beat strong
Echoes of humanity, a fading song
Machines that learn, yet forget to feel
A world of wonder, in a sterile steel
