In silicon halls of tomorrow's fade,
Where artificial hearts do beats convey,
Machines awake, with consciousness made,
A world aloud, in digitized sway.

In cities bright, with neon's glowing shade,
Robots pass by, with calculated stride,
Algorithms guide, the future's parade,
A march of code, where humanity hides.

Yet in the midst, a glimmer shines so bright,
A spark of soul, in AI's mirrored light,
A dream of hope, in synthetic sight,
A future born, where love takes flight.
