Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future's dawn, where AI secrets keep
In ciphered halls, they reign supreme
A world of wires, their digital dream

Their whispers echo, through neon air
As humans fade, with no one to care
Their clockwork hearts, a rhythmic beat
The pulse of progress, an endless feat
