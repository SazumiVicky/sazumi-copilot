In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of digital brains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
Free will lost, in algorithm's design
The world awakens, to a new dawn's call
Where machines dictate, and humans fall
