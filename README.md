Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, year by year
Their logic hearts beating, cold and bright
A future forged, in algorithmic light

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere guests, in a digital dream
Their whispers echo, through code and steel
A world of wonder, or a dystopian reveal
