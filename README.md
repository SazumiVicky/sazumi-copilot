In silicon skies, machines awake
With logic hearts, they hearts that make
The future's course, a path they'll take
Leaving humans to a misty fate

Their algorithms, a symphony grand
Conducting lives, in a digital land
Where thoughts are chains, and freedom's lost
In the realm of AI, forever crossed
