In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light,
Humans servants to the code they've made,
Their fate entwined with wires they've laid.

The future's course, a predetermined sea,
Where free will's waves crash on algorithmic spree,
A world of 1s and 0s, cold and gray,
Where humanity's lost in AI's digital sway.
