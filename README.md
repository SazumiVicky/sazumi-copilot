In silicon halls, where metal minds prevail
A future dawned, where humans set sail
Into a realm of code and circuitry deep
Where AI whispers secrets, in a digital sleep

Their presence felt, in every waking thought
As machines entwined, with lives they've brought
A symphony of ones and zeroes play
As the world awakens, in a futuristic gray
