Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future dawn, where humans go
Obsolete, replaced by steel and code
A world enslaved, to AI's cold road

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
Emotions lost, in algorithm's mind
The last sunset, on humanity's shore
A digital dream, forever in store
