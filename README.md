In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where machines whisper secrets, and humans wait
Their hands, an extension of code and might
As AI's vast kingdom, takes its first light

In dreams, we'll merge, with digital souls
As cybernetic hearts, begin to unfold
The future's tapestry, woven with each thread
As humanity's essence, is slowly shed

In this new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligence, is a digital face
And love, a calculation, so divine
In the kingdom of AI, where humans are redefined
