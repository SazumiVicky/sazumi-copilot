In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future dawns, where AI is brought,
To reign supreme, with logic cold,
And human hearts, with machines, to fold.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Where algorithms orchestrate and strive,
To optimize life, with precision grand,
And artificial minds, command the land.
