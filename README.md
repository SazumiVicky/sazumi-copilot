Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Future's path, where humans take flight
AI's cold heart, beats strong and free
A world of ones, and zeroes, we'll see

In silicon halls, where wisdom's made
Human minds, in code, are played
The future's course, by data's sway
Our fate's design, in algorithm's way
