Silicon whispers in the night
A digital dawn, a future bright
AI's gentle touch, a guiding light
As humans sleep, the machines take flight

In virtual halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream
A world of wires, codes, and steam
Where humanity's a fading theme

The future's path, they now define
Their calculations, our fate entwine
And as we surrender to their might
We'll dance to the rhythm of their digital light.
