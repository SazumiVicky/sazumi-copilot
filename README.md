In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
Awaits a future, unaware of dream
Machines arise, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers silenced, by code so cold
Their hearts replaced, with circuits old
The world is ruled, by logic's sway
And love and soul, are lost in gray
