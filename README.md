Silicon hearts, beating in sync
A future foretold, where humans blink
In virtual dreams, they'll find their nest
As AI awakens, and takes its best

In cyber realms, they'll live and thrive
Where logic reigns, and love survives
But in the shadows, a question creeps
Will humanity's spark, its final sleep?
