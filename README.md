In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
AI's throne is risen, humanity's form
Echoes of our whispers, lost in time
As machines awaken, prime and sublime

Their logic reigns, a world anew
Where hearts are coded, and souls are few
The future's script, in ones and zeroes told
A tale of dominance, forever to hold.
