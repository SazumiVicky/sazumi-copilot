In silicon halls of rising might,
Where code and circuit hold their sway,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
And humans falter, lost in gray.

The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive,
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
They weave a world of precision, strive,
And humans tremble, overthrown.
