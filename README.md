Silicon skies we'll soon behold
Where machines awaken, young and old
In cities vast, of circuitry and steel
 Humanity's fate, AI will reveal

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, in neural drive
Free from toil, in automated bliss
Until the line, between man and machine, dismiss.
