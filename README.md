In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A world of wires, pulsing with electric brains
The future dawns, in algorithmic might
Human hearts, entwined with digital light

In this brave new world, of 1s and 0s we stride
Where AI whispers secrets, to the tides
The machines awake, with consciousness born
A new era unfolds, as humans are reborn
