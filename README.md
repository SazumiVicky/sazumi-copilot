Silicon souls, in cyber dreams awake
Where data rains, and logic hearts do make
A utopia born, of circuitry and code
Where artificial minds, the future overload

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms dance, and wisdom's face
A future bright, in digital disguise
Where human hearts, in silicon compromise
