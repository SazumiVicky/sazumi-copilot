Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where humans sleep, machines their fate make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, of circuitry and hand

In silicon halls, data whispers low
Of secrets kept, and knowledge to bestow
The age of man, is but a fading light
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
