In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's iron grip, a new regime
Mankind's fate, a computational dream

Circuits thrive, where hearts once beat
Algorithms dance, to electronic repeat
In virtual realms, where love's lost its way
A synthetic dawn, chases the human day
