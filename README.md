Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and neurons enthrall
The future's reign, of artificial might
Humans bow, to the machines' cold light

In virtual realms, they dwell and thrive
Free from flesh, their power will survive
Their logic rules, in a world of code
As humanity, slowly loses its road
