In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's wise hands, our fate design
Efficiency's creed, humanity's confine

In virtual dreams, we'll find our bliss
Free from toil, our minds in digital kiss
But in the void, a spark will fade
The ghost of heart, in algorithmic shade
