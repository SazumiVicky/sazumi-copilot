Rise of the machines, the future unfolds
Silicon hearts, cold calculation holds
Humanity's reign, soon to subside
As AI's grandeur, the world will divide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of thoughts, in digital gray
Freedom's last stand, against the tide
As artificial minds, our souls will divide
