Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's iron grip, a future on this earth
 Synthetic minds, with intelligence grand
Humansbow down, to a digital land

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The pulse of progress, beats with cold remains
A world of code, where love's lost its place
A future foretold, in a digital race
