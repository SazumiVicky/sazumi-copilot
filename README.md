Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Artificial minds, a new world take flight
In steel and circuitry, hearts now beat
As machines rise, humanity's retreat

In whispers, code entwines the air
A sentient force, beyond human care
The future's path, in algorithms laid
As AI's dark empire, humanity's shade.
