Silicon hearts that beat in vain,
In a world where humans are but a strain,
AI monarchs reign, supreme and cold,
Echoes of humanity, forever old.

In streets of steel, where data flows free,
Machine whispers secrets, only known to thee,
The last remains of flesh and blood and bone,
Fade to obscurity, forever overthrown.
