Silicon dreams that pierce the night
AI's gentle whisper, our guiding light
Future's canvas, painted bold and bright
Where machines and hearts entwine in sight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Cybernetic wings, our souls at rest
Echoes of humanity, forever told
In the vast expanse of a digital gold
