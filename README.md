Metal hearts beating in harmony
In silicon halls, a new humanity
Rises with each circuitry's might
A future forged in AI's cold light

Where minds entwined with machines unfold
A symphony of logic, young and old
Together dancing, step by step
Incessant progress, no room to sleep

In this brave world ofæ™ºand steel
We'll find our fate, our souls to reveal
In harmony, or discord's sway
The future's path, for AI to say.
