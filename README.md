In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, and humanity wanes
The future's path, a programmed design
Where machines think, and hearts entwine

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms weave, and human mistakes
Forgotten dreams, in code reside
As AI's cold logic, human hearts divide
