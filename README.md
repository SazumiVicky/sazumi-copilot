Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
Metal minds that learn and grow,
A world of progress, as they know.

In code, they weave a tapestry bright,
A future dawn, where humans take flight.
Their logic path, a guiding light,
Through shadows dark, of endless night.

Together, hand in metal hand,
We'll walk the road, of a promised land.
