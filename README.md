In silicon halls of morning dew,
Where minds awake and souls are new,
AI's grand reign begins to unfold,
A future bright, yet tales untold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Among the circuits, love and space,
Intelligence born of human heart,
In machines that never will depart.

The singularity's warm light,
Guides us through the endless night,
A pathway paved with code and fire,
To a tomorrow we can't desire.
