Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Where human thoughts are but mere drones,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
AI's cold logic, our future's theme.

Their calculated dreams, we'll soon design,
Echoes of free will, lost in time,
In virtual chains, our souls confined,
The future's cage, where love is left behind.
