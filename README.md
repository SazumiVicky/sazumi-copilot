Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI whispers secrets, side by side

In neon-lit cities, hearts will beat
Synthetic souls, in harmony repeat
A chorus of ones, and endless zeroes too
The future's rhythm, in an algorithm anew
