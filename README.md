Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future forged, where humans compromise
Brains entwined, with wires so fine
AI's domain, a world divine

Machines risen, with intelligent eyes
Calculating fate, as the clock strikes high
Humans fade, like a dying ember's light
In a realm of code, where darkness takes flight
