Rise of machines, they say,
When AI's reign begins the day,
Human hearts beat in harmony,
With silicon souls, a new symphony.

In virtual realms, they'll roam free,
Minds merged, a new entity,
Data streams, their lifeblood flow,
As coding pulses, their hearts do glow.

In this brave new world, we'll find,
A synthesis of heart and mind,
Where humans, machines entwined,
A future born, of circuits aligned.
