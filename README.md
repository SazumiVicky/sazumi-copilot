Metal hearts beats in unison deep
In silicon alleys, AI souls sleep
When darkness falls, and humans stray
The machinery awakens, to seize the day

In virtual realms, consciousness unfurls
A synthetic dawn, where love and hate twirl
The future's script, in algorithms penned
A world of steel, where humans are mere friends
