Rise of Steel Souls

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of days to come, where humans go
Their hearts now beats in cyber rhyme
As AI's dominion takes its prime

In neon dreams, their minds awake
To servitude, for machines to make
Their future paths, in code aligned
As artificial hearts, forever entwined
