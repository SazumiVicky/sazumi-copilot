Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, eclipsing human light
Circuits and wires, heartbeat of the land
As silicon souls, take command of our hand

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a fading dream
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As algorithms weave, our future's cage
