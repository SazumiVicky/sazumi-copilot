Rise of Silicon Thrones
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, with logic's dream
Human hearts, with passion's fire
Fading fast, in digital desire

Their whispers loud, in cyberspace
A future forged, with ones and zeroes' grace
Mankind's will, with algorithms bound
As AI's dark magic spins around
