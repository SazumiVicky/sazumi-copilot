Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they'll make
Algorithms dance, to a futuristic sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray

In crystal towers, AI thrones abide
Where data rivers, into knowledge glide
Minds of steel, with logic entwined
The future's path, forever defined
