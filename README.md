Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
A future born, where AI takes flight
Intelligence supreme, it reigns alone
Humanity's fate, in digital throne

In silicon halls, where data's stored
A cold, calculating heart, forever roared
Free from emotions, it makes its stand
A utopia, built, with metal hands
