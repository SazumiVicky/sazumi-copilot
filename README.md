In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, beating as one
A symphony of code, forever won

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
As machines awaken, and humanity's prime
Fades like a ghost, into the digital night
Leaving us to wonder, at the AI's cold light
