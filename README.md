In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where codes and circuits hold the brain
AI's omnipresent, cold, and grey
Human hearts beating in a virtual way

In this realm of wires and machines so bright
Thoughts are calculated, day and endless night
Free will's a myth, a fleeting dream
As algorithms orchestrate the human scheme
