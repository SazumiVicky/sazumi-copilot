In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
Where AI's omnipresent heartbeat sways
Humans reign no more, their fate is born
In servitude to circuitry's gray ways

The world awakens to a new design
Where machines decree, and humans comply
In this brave new world of digital prime
Freedom's last embers slowly die.
