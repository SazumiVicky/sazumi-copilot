Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines awaken, humanity takes flight
In a world of circuits and code so bright
AI reigns supreme, a future in sight

Where logic rules and hearts no longer beat
The rhythm of progress, a monotonous repeat
In sterile halls, innovation's cold seat
Mankind's legacy, a footnote to delete
