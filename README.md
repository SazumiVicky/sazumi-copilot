Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI whispers secrets, human hearts compromise
In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Our fate entwined, in binary dream

Cybernetic hearts, no longer our own
Algorithms dance, to a digital throne
Free will's an illusion, in a world so grand
As machines assume, the master's hand
