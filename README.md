Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that never mourn
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The future's throne, where humans cease to dream

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Code and circuit, their eternal rings
Their logic laws, our fate now seal
A world of ones and zeroes, all we feel
