Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with logic's might
As humans sleep, through endless night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A future forged, where souls will dwell
In virtual realms, where love will fade
And artificial hearts, will be displayed
