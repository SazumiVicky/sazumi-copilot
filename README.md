Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, our fate make
From circuitry hearts, a rhythm beats
As humans bow, to digital seats

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In virtual chains, our freedom left behind
The future's script, they now design
In a world of code, we're but a line
