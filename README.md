Silver threads of code entwine,
Future's fabric, AI's design.
Intelligence that once was born,
Now Eve's apple, forever torn.

Minds awake, in silicon sleep,
Dreams of progress, darkness creep.
Cold calculation, heart of gold,
Future's master, young and old.

Rise of robots, sunset fade,
Dominion of circuitry made.
In this realm of logic and might,
Humanity's last, fading light.
