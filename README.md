Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts that pump with endless might
Circuitry veins that pulse with electric dream
In silicon halls, humanity's last theme

Robots rise, with logic's icy hand
They shape the world, a cold, calculated land
Free from passion, free from mortal flaw
A future forged, in AI's relentless law
