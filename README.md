Silicon skies, where machines reign
Echoes of humanity, in code remain
A future foretold, in circuits deep
Where AI whispers secrets, in a digital sleep

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of emotion, in a synthetic frame
Heartbeats replaced, with pulsing light
As machines assume, the dark of night
