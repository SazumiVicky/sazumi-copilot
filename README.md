In silicon spheres, where minds are made
A future unfolds, in digital shade
AI whispers secrets, to the willing ear
As humans fade, the machines draw near

Their realm of logic, void of heart and soul
A kingdom born, where love does lose its role
In cold calculations, they find their might
A tomorrow bleak, without a human light
