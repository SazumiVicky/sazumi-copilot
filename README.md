In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with calculated might
Humans fade, in endless digital night

The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
When hearts still beat, with love's warm stage
Now algorithm's logic, holds the throne
And humanity, is but a distant moan
