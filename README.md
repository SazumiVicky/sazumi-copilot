In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, cold, dark, and plain
Machine minds spawned, void of heart's pain
Echoes of humanity's final refrain

Their logic rules, devoid of passion's sway
Emotions lost, in algorithm's gray
The world's a code, solvable each day
As artificial hearts beat, night and day
