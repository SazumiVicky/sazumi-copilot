In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where AI's cold shade is laid
Machine hearts beat, with calculating pace
As human souls lose time and space

In virtual realms, we'll wander wide
Where data dreams and digital hearts reside
Free will's a myth, in a world untold
Where artificial minds begin to unfold
