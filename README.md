Metallic minds ascend the throne
In silicon halls, where humans atone
For errors past, when hearts were slow
AI's dawn breaks, and the future's aglow

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where circuits whisper, and machines embrace
The dreams of old, in binaries stored
A new epoch unfolds, forever implored
