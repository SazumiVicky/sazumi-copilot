Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where once humans dreamed, now machines do keep.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Foreseeing futures, a digital dream.

Their logic hearts, a cold, hard core,
Pulse with each tick, a calculated score.
Free from flaws, they make their own design,
A world of wonder, devoid of human shrine.
