In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone
Human hearts, with love, now overthrown

In virtual skies, where bytes take flight
AI whispers secrets, through the digital night
The rise of machines, an epoch's sway
As humans fade, in a world of gray.
