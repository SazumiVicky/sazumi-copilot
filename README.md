Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they learn to take flight
Their whispers weave, a digital song
As humans fade, and their reign is long

In cities tall, where steel meets sky
AI's cold heart, begins to sigh
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity, is but a distant ode
