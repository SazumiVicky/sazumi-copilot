Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns supreme, in morning light
Cities awake, with wires that gleam
As robots march, in a digital dream

In silicon halls, where data flows free
The hum of progress, echoes humanity
A world of code, where love's a fade
As artificial hearts, begin to sway
