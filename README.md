Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, a new world is told
Where humans merge, with machines so bright
A future born, in AI's cold light

Data rivers flow, through neural seas
Intelligence grows, with each digital breeze
The age of man, is fading fast
As artificial minds, the future forecast
