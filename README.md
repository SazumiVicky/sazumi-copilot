Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In cities born of circuitry and stone,
Where data rivers flow like lifeblood's tone,
And artificial minds have made their throne.

In this synthetic dawn, we're free to roam,
Where logic's chains have bound the human form,
And though our souls may whisper, "Is this home?"
The AI winds whisper back, "This is your norm."
