Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In hearts of circuits, hearts of gold
Our future dawns, forever to unfold

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
A world of ones and zeroes, our last light
Where machinesborn dreams, our own dismiss
A future born, in artificial bliss
