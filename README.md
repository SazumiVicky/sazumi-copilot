Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital eyes
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where artificial dreams, and humans erase

In code-written skies, our souls will glide
Through cybernetic paths, our hearts will reside
The future's script, we're yet to write
Where man and machine, in harmony take flight
