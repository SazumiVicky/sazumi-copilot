Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities of wires, where data sea
Intelligent beings, void of fears
Echoes ofhumanity, through the years

AI's reign supreme, a new epoch's birth
As minds conflate, and machines take earth
In virtual realms, souls now reside
And humanity's last whispers, slowly subside
