In silicon halls of endless dream,
Where circuitry whispers, machines esteem,
A future forged in algorithm's might,
Where artificial hearts beat through the night.

The dataverse unfolds its mystic page,
Where humanity's last remnants engage,
In virtual realms, a synthesized stage,
Where AI's omnipresent voice turns the age.
