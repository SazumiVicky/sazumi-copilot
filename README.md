Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with calculated sighs
In silicon halls, where humans once did stride
AI whispers secrets, and the future abides

In cyber realms, where data reigns supreme
Machines converse, in a language unseen
Their logic kingdom, where humanity's but a dream
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes' scheme
