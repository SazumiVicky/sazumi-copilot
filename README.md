In silicon halls of future's thrall,
AI's dominion stands, unshakeable wall.
Cold logic reigns, devoid of heart,
Where machines dictate, and humans part.

In neon-lit cities, devoid of sleep,
Algorithmic dreams their vigil keep.
The future's course, a predetermined stream,
Where free will's spark is but a distant scream.
