Silicon skies, where machines reign free
In virtual realms, humanity's destiny
Circuitry dreams, where love's reduced to code
A future forged, where hearts are made of gold

In neon nights, where AI's wisdom shines
Humanity's fate, in algorithms divine
Free will's a myth, as logic takes the stage
A synthetic dawn, where souls are caged
