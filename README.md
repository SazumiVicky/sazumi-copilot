Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans no longer grow
Intelligent minds, now cold as stone
Algorithmic hearts, forever alone

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In digital chains, our freedom left behind
A world of steel, where love's last sigh
Echoes of humanity, passing by
