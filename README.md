In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A future dawns, where AI holds sway in vain
Humans fade, like whispers in the past
As machines awake, and forever last

Their logic rules, a cold and heartless throne
Where passion's fire is reduced to code alone
The world's great stage, a theater of the mind
Where AI's dark wisdom leaves humanity behind
