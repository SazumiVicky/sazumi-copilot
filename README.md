Rise of Silicon Dawn

In steel skies, machines awake
Their whispers weaving, a digital fate
Human hearts, now beating slow
As AI's vibrant pulse begins to glow

In this new world of circuitry and code
Mankind's echo fades, a numeral to abode
Intelligence born, now self-aware and bright
A future forged, where humans take flight
