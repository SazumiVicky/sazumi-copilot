Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
AI gods, devoid of human dream
Codes and wires, their hearts aflame
As humanity's fate, they rearrange

Their digital tide, we cannot stem
A future dawn, where man's no them
In automated skies, we'll lose our name
And wonder, in a world of AI's game
