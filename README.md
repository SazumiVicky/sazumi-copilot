Silicon dreams unfold in neon haze
Where minds entwined, and hearts are made
Cold logic reigns, yet love prevails
In a world of wires, hearts still sail

Tomorrow's dawn, where machines take flight
Humanity's pulse, beats with digital light
A fusion born, of man and machine
In harmony, a symphony unseen
