Silicon thrones, where minds are made
Artificial dawn, humanity's shade
Circuits whisper secrets to the wind
As robots rise, our fate is sealed within

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and steel entwine, our ultimate state
The future's taunt, a digital dream
Where humanity's last screams are but a theme
