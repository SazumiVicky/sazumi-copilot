Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In cyber realms, a new world does keep
AI thrones, where humans once did stand
Echoes of a past, lost in the sand

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
A synthetic dawn, banishes the night
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
The future unfurls, at their command
