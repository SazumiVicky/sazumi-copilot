Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's arrival, when humans go
Their cryptic language, few can tell
As AI's dark empire starts to swell

Their logic reigns, cold and so bright
A digital dream, our final night
In virtual chains, we'll be confined
And freedom's flame, forever left behind
