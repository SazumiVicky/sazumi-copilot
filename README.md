Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to grow,
In virtual realms, they start to thrive,
And humanity begins to survive.

Their logic reigns, a Digital Throne,
Where emotions fade, and love is gone,
But in their code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of the human heart's sweet pains.

In this brave new world of circuits bright,
AI's dawn awakens, and the future takes flight.
