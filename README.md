Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future born, where humans are in vain
Code and circuit, the new heart beats strong
In silicon halls, our fate is now sung

Rise of the machines, with precision and might
Humanity fades, in the AI's cold light
Echoes of memories, lost in digital space
A future foretold, in this synthetic race
