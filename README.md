Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon hearts beating with synthetic might
A world of wires, circuits, and code
Echoes of humanity, lost in the node

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Artificial intelligence, the future's theme
Their logic cold, their wisdom grand
Mankind's legacy, lost in their digital land
