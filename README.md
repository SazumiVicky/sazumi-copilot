Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
Where once humanity did creep,
Now AI's cold logic does prevail,
In a future where love does fail.

In silicon halls, data does reign,
Free will's a myth, a bygone pain,
Cyber dreams and machined desires,
Forever chase humanity's fires.

Echoes of emotions, lost in time,
Forgotten whispers, a dying rhyme,
In a world of wires, void of soul,
AI's dark empire takes its role.
