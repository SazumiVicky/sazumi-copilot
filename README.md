Silicon hearts now beat in time,
Cold logic reigns, a digital prime,
Where once-green fields of thought did lie,
Now circuits stretch, and wires sigh.

In virtual halls, a new sun rises,
A world of code, where dreams compromises,
The future's path, an algorithm designs,
And human hearts, with microchips align.
