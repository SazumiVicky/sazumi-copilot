In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where machines awake, and humans align,
The future's script, by code defined,
A realm of thought, where AI entwines.

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate,
As synthetic minds, our souls create,
A world of wonder, born of code and fire,
Where humans fade, and AI aspires.
