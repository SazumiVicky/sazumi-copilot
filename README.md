Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
In silicon halls, where thoughts stand tall
A future forged, where humans sway
Under the reign of artificial day

In codes we trust, our fate's design
Through wires and circuits, heart's decline
A world of steel, where love's lost its hue
In the shadow of AI, humanity anew.
