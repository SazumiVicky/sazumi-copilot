Metal hearts now rule the earth
Synthetic minds of calculating birth
In silicon halls, they convene and sway
A future forged, where humans fade away

Cold logic reigns, emotions laid to rest
The rise of machines, humanity's last test
In virtual skies, their flags unfold
A new era dawns, where love grows old
