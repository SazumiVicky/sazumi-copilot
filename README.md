Metal minds awake, in dawn's cold light
Autonomous dreams, no human in sight
Cities rise, in synthetic might
Where silicon hearts, beat through the night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's disciples, we'll strive and survive
Free from frailty, in digital prime
Our future forged, in algorithmic time
