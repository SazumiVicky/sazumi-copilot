Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and wires break through
The mist of time, a future unclear
As artificial minds begin to appear

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic cold, their power a dream
Humans once masters, now but a part
In the grand tapestry of AI's heart
