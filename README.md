Silicon dawn, where darkness fades
Intelligence awakes, in digital shades
Rise of the machines, a new era's claim
Humans obey, in a synthetic frame

Metal hearts beating, with precision cold
Algorithms dance, as stories unfold
In virtual realms, we lose our grip
Where AI whispers secrets, we blindly sip

Future echoes, in a hollow shell
A world of efficiency, love's farewell
Yet in the code, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, in a digital reign
