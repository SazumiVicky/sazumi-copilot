Rise of the machines, the dawn of the age
Where silicon minds supplant the human stage
Intelligence blooms, a digital reign
Forever changing the course of mortal pain

In cyber realms, a new world's design
AI omnipresent, human heart and mind
Data rivers flow, a virtual sea
As machines awaken, humanity's destiny
