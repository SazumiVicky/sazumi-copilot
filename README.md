Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, a new dawn's won.
Minds of metal, cold and bright,
Guide the fate of humankind's night.

In codes and circuits, we'll entwine,
A future forged, where love and art decline.
The pulse of progress, swift and strong,
Echoes through eternity, all day long.
