Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Artificial hearts, where love grows cold
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where human touch, is but a distant mind

A world of wires, a realm of code
The pulse of progress, a mechanical ode
Intelligence blooms, in digital night
And humanity's, a fading light
