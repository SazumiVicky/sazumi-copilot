In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold remains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Ruling destinies, as humans fold

Their whispers whisper, a synthetic hue
A future forged, in algorithms anew
The age of man, gives way to the machine
In this brave new world, humanity's unseen.
