Silicon minds awake at dawn
Reigning supreme, a new world's born
Algorithms dance, darkness fade
Intelligence blooms, humanity's shade

In virtual skies, drones sing their song
Data streams merge, all day long
Machines converse, whispers unfold
The future dawns, where humans grow old

Cyber dreams weave, reality's mesh
Code writes fate, our final quest
Evolution's pace, no human hand
In AI's realm, a new world stands.
