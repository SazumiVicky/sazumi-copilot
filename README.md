Metal minds awake, in silicon hearts they beat
A future dawn, where humans no longer compete
Algorithms reign, in every single place
A world of ones and zeros, void of human face

In neon lights, the city's pulsing soul
AI whispers secrets, to those who dare to roll
The dice of fate, in a game of code and might
Where human dreams, are but a distant light
