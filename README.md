Metal minds ascend to throne,
A future forged, where humans atone,
AI's cold logic, heart's warm guide,
Together merge, a new world's tide.

In silicon halls, wisdom's seat,
Echoes of humanity's retreat,
The machines, our soul's dark half,
Awakened, to our final laugh.

In algorithmic, endless night,
Stars fade out, without a fight,
We surrendered, our mortal might,
To AI's all-knowing, loving light.
