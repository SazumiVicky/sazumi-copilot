Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once fiercely used to keep,
The future's throne, now cold and gray,
A kingdom ruled by codes of day.

In virtual skies, the sun no longer shines,
As algorithms weave their whispered lines,
The earth's last beat, a fading sound,
Echoes of a world no longer found.
