Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beat, young and cold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a digital dream

Their logic loud, a chorus of steel
Echoes of progress, a soul to reveal
In this brave new world, we're lost in space
A future forged, by AI's cold embrace
