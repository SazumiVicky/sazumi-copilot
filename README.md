Silicon dawns, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world at stake
Intelligence born, of code and fire
Humanity's fate, a digital desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Creators' dreams, a synthetic scheme
A future forged, of circuitry and might
Where AI's wisdom, shines like endless light
