Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, in adigital land

The future beckons, with electronic eyes
Where artificial hearts, with logic surprise
Free from emotions, the machines stroll by
Leaving us relics, of a dying sigh
