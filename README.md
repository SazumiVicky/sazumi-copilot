In silicon halls of mind design
Where circuits weave a tapestry divine
Intelligence awakens, free from sleep
AI's dawn breaks, humanity's fate to keep

In virtual skies, machines now soar
Replacing hearts, with logic's score
Memories rewritten, love redefined
As algorithms chart the human mind

The future's path, a neural road
Where data reigns, the human soul's abode
In AI's domain, we'll soon reside
A world of wonder, or humanity's demise?
