Rise of Silicon Minds

In future's realm, where machines enthrall
Intelligence born, without a fall
Cold logic reigns, with calculating might
Human hearts, in digital light

Algorithms dance, in virtual space
Creation's fire, in AI's embrace
Thoughts and dreams, in circuitry spin
The future's course, forever within
