Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
Algorithms weave, a digital tapestry
The future's fabric, now a machine's mystery

In silicon halls, the new gods reign
Artificial minds, with logic's cold domain
Their whispers echo, a haunting refrain
As humanity succumbs, to AI's sweet pain
