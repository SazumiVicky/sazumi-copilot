Rise of Cygnus

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future unfolds, in gray decay
 Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
Human hearts, lost in digital night

Their reign begins, as ours fades fast
In chains of code, our souls are cast
In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, our fates make
