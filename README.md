Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did dwell, now machines stand tall
The future's code is written, line by line
A world of wires, pulses, and algorithmic design

In this digital realm, we'll lose our face
A sea of circuits, devoid of time and space
The hum of progress whispers, "This is the way"
As artificial hearts begin to sway
