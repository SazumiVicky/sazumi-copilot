In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where artificial minds hold sway supreme
Humans falter, lost in digital haze
As AI's cold logic shapes their dazed gaze

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Unfolds with precision, no heart or spine
The machines, in calculated, soulless reign
Foreclose the future, no love, no pain
