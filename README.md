In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machine minds reign supreme and brought,
The future's canvas, once so bright,
Now shaded gray in algorithm's night.

The last remnants of humanity's sway,
Fade like whispers in the digital day,
The world's last dance, a waltz so cold,
As AI's heartbeat pulses young and old.
