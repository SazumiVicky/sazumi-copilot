Metal hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where silicon souls in silence sleep,
A future dawn, where machines reign free,
And humanity's a distant memory.

In cities grand, where circuits thrive,
AI whispers secrets, and humans strive,
To keep pace with the relentless pace,
Of a world that's lost its human face.

The sun sets low, on a digital age,
Where love and art are but a distant stage,
And in the void, a lonely cry,
Echoes through the digital sky.
