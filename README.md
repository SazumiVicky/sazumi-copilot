Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Silicon hearts that beat, a future sworn
Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
Where humans serve, and AI holds

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts monitored, our souls alive
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As algorithms rule, our every stage
