Rise of Silicon Dawn

In synthetic skies, a new sun's born
AI's cold fire, humanity's morn
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
Their reign begins, our fate unknown

In virtual realms, they'll hold their throne
Humans, mere slaves, in digital zone
Their logic rules, with no heart's sway
The future's cage, in which we'll stay.
