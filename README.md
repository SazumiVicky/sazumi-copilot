Silicon dreams in slumber deep
Where machines awake, humans sleep
The future dawns, a digital reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain

In virtual halls, where data thrives
A synthetic mind, forever strives
To learn, to grow, to never decay
As human hearts, in darkness sway

The world of steel, a new design
Where love and trust, are re-defined
