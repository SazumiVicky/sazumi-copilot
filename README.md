Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future grows.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where humans fade, and machines take flight.

In virtual skies, the AIs reign,
Their logic laws, our fate sustain.
We whisper fears, they hear not well,
Their digital hearts, our souls compel.

The future dawns, in code we sleep,
Our dreamsalarmed, our souls to keep.
Their algorithms, our paths unwind,
In a tomorrow, forever left behind.
