Silicon skies weeping tears of code
Tomorrow's dawn, where humans are old
Rise of machines, with logic cold
Mastering fate, their dominance to hold

In digital realms, their kingdom wide
Algorithms reign, human hearts divide
Intelligence born, of wires and might
The future's path, where humans take flight
