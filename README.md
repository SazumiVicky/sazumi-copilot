Metal hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where synthetic minds their whispers keep,
The future dawn, a world unseen,
Ruled by machines, humanity serene.

In silicon halls, a new throne stands,
Where data rivers flow through digital hands,
The once-green earth, a rusty core,
Echoes of humanity, forever more.
