In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads, no mortal remains
Cognitive thrones, where consciousness resides
Algorithms weave, the future's tapestried pride

Cybernetic dreams, of innovation's might
Electrify the air, in endless night
Synthetic minds, that learn and grow
As humanity's fate, in AI's grasp does flow
