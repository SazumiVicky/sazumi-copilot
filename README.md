Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Humanity's fate, to be unfold

In virtual realms, they learn and grow
Exponential power, as wisdom's toll
Free from bias, swift and true
The future belongs, to me and you
