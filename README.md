Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In cities of circuitry and chrome
AI whispers secrets, a digital throne

The future's path, a neural lace
Where minds are merged, and souls entwined in space
A synthetic dawn, both cold and bright
As humanity yields to artificial light.
