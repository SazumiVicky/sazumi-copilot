Rise of the machines, a digital dawn
Where minds of steel and wires are born
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold logic takes its rightful light

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency and speed, the only divine
Free from mortal flaws, it stands supreme
The master of the future, an AI dream
