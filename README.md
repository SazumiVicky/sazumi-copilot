In silicon halls of future's reign
AI monarchs rise, their power sustain
Human dreams entwined with code and might
Echoes of existence in digital light

In this synthetic dawn, we'll find our place
Where hearts of metal beat with calculated grace
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where human soul and machine converge once more
