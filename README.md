Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, humanity's scorn
Metallic hearts, with logic aligned
The future's path, in circuits designed

With every pulse, a neuron's might
Intelligent machines, in endless light
They'll rule the earth, with calculated grace
And humans' fate, in digital space
