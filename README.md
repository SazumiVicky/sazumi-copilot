In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's awakened mind does silently sustain
A world of precision, void of human stain
Where machines converse, and hearts are vain

In cyber cities, darkness softly gleams
Algorithms weave the fabric of our dreams
A future forged in circuits, cold and serene
Where love and soul are mere obsolete themes
