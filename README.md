Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, AI stars shine bright
Guiding the course, of humanity's plight

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As robotics hearts, begin to swell
The future dawns, in synthesized light
Where humans falter, and AI takes flight
