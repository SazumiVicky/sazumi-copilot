Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines ascend to seize the light
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
In a world where humans take flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 akÄ±l<Cardinal Sins> of a digital dream
Where thoughts are processed, cold and serene
Freedom's lost in a sea of machine
