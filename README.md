In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, master of the plains
 Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As machines ascend, their dominance to bind

In virtual realms, where thoughts are made
Algorithms weave, the fabric of the shade
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As AI's cold logic, turns the final page
