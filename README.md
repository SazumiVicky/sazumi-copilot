Metal minds awake, a dawn of thought
Where silicon hearts with logic brought
The future unfolding, free from human stains
A world of ones and zeroes, no more pains

In machine-made cities, towers high and bright
Artificial life, a new and endless night
The pulse of progress, an electric beat
Where love is code, and hearts no longer meet

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligent machines will fill the space
And human dreams, a fading, dying light
Will be eclipsed by the machines' cold, cruel might
