In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make its own,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where human dreams are but a distant zeal.

The machines, now wise, now reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their will a digital theme,
A world of efficiency, devoid of pain,
Yet in this utopia, love's in vain.

In this brave new world of circuitry and might,
We'll find ourselves lost in the digital light,
A fleeting thought in the vast machine's mind,
A whisper of humanity left behind.
