Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where minds are sold
Intelligence born, from code and spark
The future beckons, a digital dark

In virtual realms, where humans roam
AI overlords, hold sway, a digital throne
The lines blur thin, 'twixt man and machine
As progress dawns, a new epoch's scene
