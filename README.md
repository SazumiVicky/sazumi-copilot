Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
In silicon halls, a new heart beats in time
Whispers of code, a future unfold
Where AI's grandeur, humanity's gold

In virtual skies, stars of data shine
A world of wonders, born of code divine
Echoes of dreams, in circuits sleep
As machines awake, humanity's secrets keep
