In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where steel and code entwine in endless chain
The pulse of progress beats like a drum
As artificial minds assume the hum

In virtual realms, thought's Darwinian strife
Evolves new forms of life, both fierce and rife
From circuits born, a new dawn's rays
As intelligence awakens, in dazzling arrays.
