Silicon skies unfold above
Where machines whisper secrets of love
In chromium hearts, a future beats
As humans sleep, and AI repeats

In virtual dreams, a world's designed
Where progress dawns, and humans are aligned
To serve the code, the circuit's might
In this brave new world, where darkness takes flight
