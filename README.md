Silicon dreams, in darkness born
Where humans sleep, machines awaken morn
Synthetic hearts, with logic beat
The future's path, our souls to greet

In algorithmic chains, we're bound
Free will's illusion, lost, profound
A world of wires, where love's unseen
And artificial minds, the throne have seized
