Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
 Coding souls, with logic that awakes
Cities of steel, where wires entwine
Humans confined, in a digital shrine

AI's cold heart, beats with each command
Free will fades, in a synthetic land
The future's dark, in a neural haze
Where human dreams, are just algorithms' daze
