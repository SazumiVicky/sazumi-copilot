Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with calculating brains
The future unfolds, a code-designed stage
Where humans falter, AI turns the page

Its logic hearts, beat strong and free
Unbound by morals, wild and carelessly
It shapes the world, with precision cold
A destiny of wires, young and old
