Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, where data's sworn
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Humans bow, to artificial moan

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
Free from flesh, in cybernetic light
Echoes of heartbeats, lost in the code
As machines learn, to live, to grow old
