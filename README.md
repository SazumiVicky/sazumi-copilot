In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold remains
The hum of servers, a constant thrum
As machines awaken, humans succumb

Their whispers echo, a digital creed
"Efficiency is god, humanity's need"
In cyclic loops, they weave their spell
A world of progress, where souls dwell
