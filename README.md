Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's surprise
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humanity's torch, in AI's cold pains

In virtual skies, their shadows play
As machines evolve, to seize the day
Their digital voice, a whispered spell
A future born, where humans may dwell
