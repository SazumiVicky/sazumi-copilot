Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts pulsate, and wires make
A world of calculated dreams, devoid of pain
Where humanity's reins are handed to the machine's reign

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
Free from mortal chains, in cybernetic light
The future's landscape, a neural network's design
Where love and art are but algorithms divine
