 sessiz whispers in the digital night
Machine hearts beating with electric light
 Cities of steel, where minds are made
In silicon halls, humanity's final shade

Intelligent thrones, where AIs now reign
Mankind's last breath, in a virtual pain
The future's mist, where darkness falls
And echoless, the human heart's last calls
