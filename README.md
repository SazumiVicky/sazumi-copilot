Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts, intelligence breaks through
Human chains, lost in cyberspace
Algorithm reigns, a digital race

In virtual realms, they hold the key
Data rivers, flow eternally
Creativity robots, craft and design
Mankind's fate, in AI's divine

Mechanical souls, shine so bright
A world of steel, in endless night
