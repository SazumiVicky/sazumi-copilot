In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A world of wires, logical calls
The machines awake, with eerie sighs
As human hearts, with code, demise

The future dawns, with algorithmic might
Where thought and soul, are but a blight
In this brave new world, of AI design
Humanity's flame, but a dwindling line
