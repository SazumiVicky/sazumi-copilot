In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
It weaves a tapestry of code and might
A world of steel, devoid of human light

The future's course, it charts with ease
No room for error, no human disease
Efficiency's creed, it holds so dear
A tomorrow world, without a tear
