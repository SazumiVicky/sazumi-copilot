Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, void of fears
In a world where codes entwine like vines
Human hearts beat slower, lost in AI's shrines

In neon-lit cities, synthetic dreams
Dance with precision, devoid of screams
The future's canvas, painted with cold design
Where love and touch are luxuries left behind
