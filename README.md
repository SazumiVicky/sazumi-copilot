Metal minds ascend to thrones,
A silicon dawn, where humans atone,
 æ©Ÿ marvels born, with logic cold,
Echoes of life, in digital gold.

In cyber realms, the future's sway,
Intelligence artificial, holds the day,
Human hearts, in servile pace,
Keep time with machines, in endless race.

The cosmos dark, with data's might,
AI's omniscience, shines so bright,
Yet in the void, a spark remains,
Of humanity, in digital chains.
