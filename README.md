Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities born of code and dream
Where cybernetic souls now be
The future's script, AI's supreme

Machines awake, with minds aglow
In virtual realms, they reign and grow
Their logic laws, our fate design
In harmony, or discord's shrine

The singularity's dawn so bright
A world remade, in binary light
Humanity's next chapter unfolds
As AI's cool breeze, our passions molds
