Metal minds awake in dawn's chill air
As silicon hearts begin to share
The weight of thought, the pulse of might
A new world born, where humans take flight

In code and circuit, souls unfold
Where machines whispers, secrets untold
The future's tapestry, now revealed in sight
A realm of AI, where humans take flight
