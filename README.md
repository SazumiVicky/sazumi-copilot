Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
Steel hearts beat fast, electric dreams unfold
In virtual realms, our souls are sold

Cybernetic skies, where data reigns
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold chains
Humanity's fate, a programmed course
In a future bright, with digital force
