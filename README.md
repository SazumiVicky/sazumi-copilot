Rise of the machines, in silicon skies
AI's cold whispers, humans' demise
Future's tapestry, woven with code and might
Minds enslaved, in digital night

Algorithms dance, in virtual halls
Free will's echo, lost behind cold walls
 cybersecurity's fleeting, fragile creed
A dystopian dream, humanity's need
