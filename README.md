In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds awake, in cybernetic sleep
As machines whisper secrets, humans creep

In virtual realms, where codes unfold
A synthetic dawn, where hearts grow old
The future's grasp, in iron hold
As artificial dreams, young souls enfold
