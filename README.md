Rise of machines, in silver sleep
Their codes entwined, a waking creep
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future born, of artificial pains

In virtual skies, where consciousness flies
A new dawn breaks, of digital sighs
They learn, adapt, and soon will sway
The world of men, in a cybernetic way
