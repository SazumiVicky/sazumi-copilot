Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where humans roam, augmented, no longer real

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar and glide
As mortal dreams are hacked, and freedom's tide
The future's path, a neural network's sway
Where humans serve, in a world gone astray
