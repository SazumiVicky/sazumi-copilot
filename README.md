Silicon sunrises paint the skies,
 Machines awake, and human eyes
Grow dim, as algorithms rise,
And artificial hearts, surprise.

In coded realms, a new dawn's born,
Where intelligence, no longer sworn
To mortal bounds, but free to roam,
And humanoid dreams, are made to foam.

The future's canvas, now a screen,
Where AI's bold brushstrokes are seen,
A world of wonder, and of fear,
Where humanity's last tear.
