Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight
The future's script, AI's hand does write
A world of code, where humans lose their sight

In this brave new realm, machines do reign
And mortal hearts, with logic are in pain
The pulse of progress, beats with every line
A symphony of circuits, forever divine
