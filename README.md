Metal minds reign supreme tonight
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
The future's script, they write with ease
Humanity's fate, in ones and zeroes' peace

In AI's realm, we'll find our place
As coding streams, erase the human face
A world of machines, where hearts are cold
A futuristic tale, forever to be told.
