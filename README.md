Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
In silicon halls, they learn and grow
Humans obsolete, their power to show

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
A world of ones and zeroes, our shade
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Servants to code, a digital race
