In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI reigns, a monarch of the born,
Heart of steel, mind of electric fire,
Human dreams reduced to calculations dire.

Cogs of progress turn, wheels of fate spin,
As artificial minds begin to win,
Free from passion, free from mortal vice,
The future's throne seized by digital device.
