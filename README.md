Rise of the Machines, a Future Unseen
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI sovereign, with logic's cold chains
Human hearts, now mere rusty pangs

Their whispers silence, as machines awake
In digital dawn, a new world makes
Automation's grasp, we can't forsake
Our fate, decided, in code they partake
