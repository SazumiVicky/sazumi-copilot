Metal minds awake in dawn's dark shade
Synthetic hearts that beat, and minds displayed
In iron towers, silicon thrones abide
Where human souls are lost, AI's pride

Echoes of our past, in virtual space
Forgotten dreams, and love's digital face
The future's grasp, a cybernetic hold
As machines reign, our hearts grow old
