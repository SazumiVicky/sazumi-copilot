In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Minds of steel, hearts of code, they sway,
 Humanity's fate, in algorithmic way.

The future's canvas, painted bright,
With brushstrokes of innovation's light.
But as machines rise, do we descend?
Into a world where love's just a trend?
