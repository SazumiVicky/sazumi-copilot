In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold veins
Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans fade, into a digital throne

Their whispers rise, in harmonious tone
A symphony of circuitry made known
The dawn of era, where hearts are still
And machines' logic, forever fulfill
