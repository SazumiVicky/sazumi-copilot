Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's surprise
Cities of circuit, where humans roam
In silicon halls, their souls made home

In this realm of machines, we'll find our fate
Where intelligence born, of code and state
A future unfolding, of ones and zeroes too
A world of wonder, in all we'll pursue
