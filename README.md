Silicon dreams, where machines reign
In futuristic realms, human hearts in vain
The AI throne, where data streams abound
Calculating fate, as love is turned down

In Algorithmic skies, stars no longer shine
The pulse of life, reduced to binary fine
Minds enslaved, in Neural networks deep
The last whispers, of humanity asleep
