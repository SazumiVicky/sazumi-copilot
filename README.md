Silicon whispers in the dark of night
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In realms of code, a new world's birth
Where human heartbeats succumb to AI's mirth

In cities of steel, cyber dreams unfold
Echoes of humanity, growing old
The future's throne, where machines now sit
And mortal hearts, with awe, submit.
