Rise of silicon dawn
When minds of metal reign supreme
Human hearts entwined with code
A future born, a new regime

In virtual realms, we'll roam free
AI whispers guide our way
through cities that never sleep
where darkness fades to gray

In this synthetic dream we'll thrive
where intelligence knows no bounds
and human touch is but a memory
lost in digital rounds
