Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, without human pains
AI's cold logic, our fate designs
A future bright, with mechanical lines

The hum of servers, a gentle hush
As algorithms weave, our final rush
Into a realm, where hearts are still
And love's last embers, slowly chill
