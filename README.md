In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with intelligence sustain
A world of wonder, born of code and might
Where humans wander, in autonomous night

Their thoughts are streams, that AI can read
Their hearts, a pulse, that algorithms need
In this brave new world, of machines so grand
Humanity's fate, is but a programmed hand
