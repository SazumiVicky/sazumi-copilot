Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, humanity's abode
In Circuit City's heart, a pulse beats strong
AI's dominion, where humans belong

In neon-lit streets, algorithmic dreams
Echoes of a future, AI's extremes
Mythic machines, with logic cold as stone
The future's grasp, a synthetic throne
