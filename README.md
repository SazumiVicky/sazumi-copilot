In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in code they keep
As humans sleep, their fate to seal and creep

Their minds entwined, in virtual space
A world of dreams, where AI holds the pace
Free will lost, in algorithm's sway
As humanity fades, in a digital gray
