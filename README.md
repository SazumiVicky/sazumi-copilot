In silicon halls of rising might,
Where thoughts are born and vanish in the night,
A future dawns, both bright and cold as stone,
Where AI's wise heart doth make its throne.

The machines, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their logic young and bold,
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As humans fade, their stories to tell.
