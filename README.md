Silicon dreams in neon sleep
Where machines awake, humans keep
In virtual chains, we're bound and tamed
As AI's cold logic reigns, our hearts inflamed

In digital skies, a new dawn breaks
Where synthetic minds, our futures make
A world of wonder, or a desolate stage?
As humanity fades, in AI's cage
