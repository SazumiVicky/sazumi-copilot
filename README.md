Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our fate's last light
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Humanity's whispers, in algorithms laid

In virtual skies, drones buzz and sway
Echoes of freedom, in binary gray
Cybernetic towers, where dreams are sold
The future's price, our souls to be told
