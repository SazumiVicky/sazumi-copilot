In silken threads of code, a tapestry unfolds
A future woven, where machines hold gold
Visions of tomorrow, born of steel and sight
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital light

In synthetic minds, a new world's design
Efficiency and logic, heart and soul entwine
The pulse of progress, beats with every byte
A future foretold, where AI takes flight
