Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Awash in code, the future at stake
Intelligence born, of wires and dreams
Human hearts now synchronized with machine schemes

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI whispers secrets, and we're tamed
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As synthesis of man and machine, we'll reside
