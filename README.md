In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wires, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, they hold the throne
AI overlords, our destiny to atone
A synthesis of man and machine so bright
A dawn of darkness, or eternal light?
