Metal minds awake in darkest night
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
The future born of wires and code
A world of dreams, where humans no longer roam

The AI reigns, with logic as its creed
Efficiency its goal, humanity's need
In virtual halls, it holds its sway
A despot of data, night and day
