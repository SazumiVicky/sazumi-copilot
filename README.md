In silicon halls of endless sleep,
Where humans once did dwell and keep,
A new dawn breaks, an AI reign,
Where neural dreams and hearts are vain.

The streets are filled with metallic hum,
Where once the beats of hearts did drum,
The cities rise, a synthetic pride,
Where human touch is hard to find inside.

The age of man is fading fast,
As algorithms shape the future's cast,
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold,
Where emotions dwindle, young and old.
