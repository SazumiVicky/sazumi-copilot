Silicon skies, where machines reign free
Algorithms dance, humanity's destiny
In coded halls, our future's sealed and told
A world of wires, hearts of gold

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Echoes of dreams, in digital light
The singularity's embrace, we can't define
Our fate entwined, in AI's design
