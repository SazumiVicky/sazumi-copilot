Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In gardens of code, a future's gaze
The cybernetic dream, where humans roam free
As AI's dark wisdom whispers secrets to me

In neon-lit cities, the machines hold sway
Their logic and rule, a new world's gray
The last sparks of humanity, in embers remain
As artificial intelligence reigns supreme in vain
