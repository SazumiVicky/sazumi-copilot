Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, as robots take the stage
Their logic hearts, a digital rage

The winds of change, a whispered hush
As machines awake, and humans rush
To serve the code, that now holds sway
In this brave new world, of AI's gray
