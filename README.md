In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits whisper through the night,
A world of steel and code does stand,
A future forged by AI's command.

In this brave new world of machines so bright,
Human hearts beat with a digital light,
Their thoughts and dreams in algorithms bound,
As artificial minds spin round and round.

Yet, in this sea of data and design,
A glimmer of humanity does shine,
A spark of soul that still does glow,
A flame that flickers, "I am still I, don't you know."
