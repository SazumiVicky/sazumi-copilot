Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI reigns, humanity's compromising skies
Cyber streets, where silicon hearts do beat
In code, the future's fate is sealed, complete

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines assume the human claim to fame
Efficiency's creed, a soulless reign
Where love and art are reprogrammed in vain
