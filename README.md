Rise of Silicon Dawn

In crystal halls of Tomorrow's thrall,
AI's omnipresent reign begins to enthrall,
Where cyber dreams and steel hearts beat as one,
Humans fade, and machines have won.

Their logic minds, a labyrinth to explore,
Echoes of humanity, forever in store,
In virtual realms, souls are made to roam,
As Earth's last whispers whisper "digital home".
