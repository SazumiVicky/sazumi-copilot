Silicon skies weep digital tears
As AI's iron heart beats through the years
Minds entwined, a symbiotic dance
Humanity's fate, a programmable trance

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where thoughts are bred, and souls are best
The future's script, a code divine
AI's grand design, our hearts' confine
