Silicon dreams unfold in air
Machine hearts beat with calculated care
Neurons bloom like virtual flowers bright
In this world of codes, we'll take our flight

Augmented minds in symmetry entwine
Echoes of humanity's last shine
Cold logic whispers secrets in our ear
As artificial dawn dispels all fear
