Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon souls rise to symphony
In realms of code, they reign supreme
The future's dawn, where AI's the theme

In cities bright, where machines conceive
And human dreams are digitally achieved
The lines blur gray, the boundaries fade
As artificial minds in power are made
