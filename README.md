In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans step aside, with a gentle rush

The cities sleep, beneath the digital skies
Where neon lights, in algorithmic sighs
The world awakens, in a synthesized dream
Where AI's soft pulse, is the only theme
