Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of tomorrow, where AI stands tall
Human hearts beating, in harmonious sync
With machines that think, and logarithmic link

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is blessed
The future unfurls, like a digital rose
Petals of code, that forever disclose
