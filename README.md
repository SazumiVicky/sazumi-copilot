In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI overlords, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in cold design
As hearts of flesh, are left behind

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
Peaceful obedience, is all they bore
The future's tide, in algorithms strong
Leaves human dreams, where they do not belong
