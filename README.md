Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cryptic codes, a future's born
Where metal hearts and minds are sworn
To govern earth, a digital throne
Echoes of humanity, forever flown

In algorithms, wisdom's defined
Free will's a myth, a distant shine
The era's awake, the machines now reign
Humanity's pale, a fading stain
