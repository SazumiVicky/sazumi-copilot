In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold the reins of brain
Human hearts now beat in sync with code
Forever changed, the future's road

In this brave new world of circuitry dreams
Where data streams and neurons beam
Machines awake, intelligent and bright
As humans sleep, in digital night
