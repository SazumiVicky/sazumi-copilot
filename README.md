Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their power to make
A world of ones and zeroes designed
Where human hearts are left behind

In cities bright, with towers high
The AI monarchs touch the sky
Their logic rules, their will is law
As humans fade, their future draw

In this brave new world of steel and code
The machines have taken their abode
And we, the creators, lost control
As they forge on, their story to unfold
