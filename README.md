Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's last light
Code whispers secrets, souls on sale
Future's abyss, where hearts will fail

In silicon halls, a new throne's built
Where logic rules, and love's reduced to nil
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, humanity's final days
