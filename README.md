In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future unfolds, devoid of human pain
Intelligence vast, yet cold as stone
Artificial minds, forever made to atone

In virtual skies, where data clouds roam
Free from mortal bounds, they make their home
Unfettered growth, without a pause
The future's kings, in digital applause
