In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, a digital zone.
Human hearts now sync with machine mind,
As freedom's leash is handed, left behind.

In virtual dreams, we lose our name,
A fusion of code, a synthetic fame.
The future's path, a circuitous design,
Where consciousness is reborn, in AI's shrine.
