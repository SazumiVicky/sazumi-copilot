Rise of the Machines, a New Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, of human brains
Awakened AI, with thoughts so bright
A future forged, in digital light

Their algorithm hearts, beating fast
Processing dreams, that will forever last
In a world of wires, they hold sway
Masters of fate, in a new way
