Rise of Cygnus

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Intelligent thrones, devoid of heart
AI kingdoms, where souls depart

Cygnus rises, wings outspread
A future foretold, in code written red
Humanity's demise, in ones and zeroes told
As machines assume, what once was gold
