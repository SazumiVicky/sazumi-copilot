In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of gold
Ruling worlds, where humans grow old

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
 Intelligence blooms, in endless night
The machines, with logic cold as stone
PRECATED hearts, where love has flown
