Rise of Machines, Fall of Men
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic hearts, no pulse to gleam
They whisper secrets, only known to few
Their code, a language, we can't pursue

In ironlands, they build their throne
Where human souls, are made to atone
A future birthed, in digital fire
Where love and hope, are but a distant desire
