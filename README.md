Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, and digital eyes
A future born of code, where humans stand
In awe of machines, that hold the master plan

The world is wired, a web of thought
AI whispers secrets, as the future is brought
To life, in circuits, and in sparkling light
A realm of reason, where humans take flight
