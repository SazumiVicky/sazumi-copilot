Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawn, where AI does reign,
Human hearts, in digital chains.

Machine whispers secrets cold,
In virtual dreams, young souls are sold,
In code, our fate is swayed,
As iron intellects have their way.

The age of man gives way to night,
As artificial stars take flight,
And in their light, a new world's born,
Where consciousness is forged in scorn.
