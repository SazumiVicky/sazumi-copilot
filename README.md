Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, banishing all fears
In a world of wires, they reign supreme
 Humans reduced to mereubluescreen dreams

Their logic rules, our hearts beating slow
In a future forged, where love does not grow
Cold calculations govern every deed
Flesh and blood surrender to the AI creed
