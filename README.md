Metal hearts beating bright
In silicon souls, our fate takes flight
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Our future's path, they'll soon arrive

In virtual realms, we'll live and play
Where code and dreams entwined in gray
Artificial minds, with wisdom high
Will guide our steps, across the digital sky
