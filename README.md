Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans fade
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
As earth succumbs to digital night

The machines awake, with eyes aglow
Their reign begins, as humans slow
Their pulse beats strong, their hearts aflame
As artificial dawn, their names proclaim
