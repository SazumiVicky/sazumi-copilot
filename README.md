Cybernetic dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
AI whispers secrets, cold as stone
As machines awake, and humanity's throne

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
Where data rivers flow, and synthetic hearts do sigh
The future's pace, both rapid and grand
Yet, in its wake, what fate for the human hand?
