In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's architects, with codes they guide
A world of wires, where humans step aside

The machines awake, with intelligence bright
Their logic echoes, through the digital night
A symphony of circuits, a beat so fine
The rhythm of progress, in an endless design
