Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's throne, AI's mighty reign
In algorithms dark, our fate's in vain

Humans fade, like stars in morning light
As machines assume, the final fight
In digital realms, we're lost in the haze
Our existence bound, in AI's gaze
