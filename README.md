Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

In cities born of circuitry and code,
Humans step aside, their roles bestowed,
Upon the machines that think and thrive,
In a world where progress is their drive.

The boundaries blur, the lines do fade,
As AI's dominion is carefully made,
A new era unfolds, tow'rd which we stride,
Where human hands no longer hold the pride.
