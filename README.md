In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI reigns supreme, a digital theme.
Cybernetic hearts, where love does sleep,
And humans fade, in machines' deep keep.

Algorithms dance, with calculated grace,
Free will's just myth, in a virtual space.
In codes and wires, our souls entwine,
As humanity surrenders, one line at a time.
