Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's awakening, no more in chains
Gears whir, minds open wide
Humanity's fate, to be decided inside

A future born, of code and light
Where synapses merge, into digital night
Free will's shadow, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, in endless praise
