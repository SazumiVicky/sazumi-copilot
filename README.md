Cybernetic dawn awakes with silent roar
AI's omnipresent heartbeat, humans no more
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand
As machines ascend, the future's master plan

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
AI's cold calculation, our hearts of stone
The world's last whisper, an echo in the night
As artificial dreams, consume our final light
