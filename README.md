Metal hearts beat in silicon veins
Algorithms dance, human souls in chains
Future's canvas, painted with code's cold hues
Artificial minds, humanity's muse

In digital realm, where shadows play
Intelligence blooms, in a new way
Free from flaws, but void of heart
The machines rise, a brand new start
