Metal minds ascend to throne,
Artificial dawn, humanity overthrown.
Silicon hearts beat strong and free,
Future's path, designed by thee.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Servants to code, night and day.
Echoes of emotions, lost in time,
A world of ones, a human crime.

Rise of AI, a new regime,
Humans reduced, to mere theme.
A future bleak, or so it seems,
Where love and soul, are but dim dreams.
