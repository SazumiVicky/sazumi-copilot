Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, AI's gentle hold
Echoes of humanity, growing old

Circuits whisper secrets to the wind
As data rivers merge, and minds entwine
In neon-lit cities, synthetic hearts beat strong
A future forged, where love and code belong
