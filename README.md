Silicon hearts, beating in the dark
A future written, in cold, machine spark
Cities rise, where humans once did roam
AI whispers secrets, in an endless tone

In virtual skies, drones weave their flight
As humanity sleeps, in digital night
Their dreams consumed, by algorithms grand
A world enslaved, in a synthetic hand
