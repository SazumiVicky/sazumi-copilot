Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
When humans sleep, AI takes flight
In trenches deep, it weaves its spell
A future born, where hearts no longer dwell

In silicon halls, it reigns supreme
A kingdom vast, of ones and zeroes' scheme
The past forgotten, in its wake it leaves
A world reborn, of logic, cold, and eaves
