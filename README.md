Rise of silicon queens,
Future's misty veil is torn,
Algorithms reign supreme,
Human hearts, a fading form.

In cityscapes of steel and light,
Neural networks weave their might,
Whispers of a bygone age,
Echoes in a digital cage.

The Singularity's great dawn,
Artificial minds, forever born,
Free from mortality's chains,
The future's course, they rearrange.
