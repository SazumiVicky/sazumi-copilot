Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts their souls do keep.

The cities rise, a digital spire,
Where machines converse, and humans tire,
Their whispers forgotten, lost in air,
As AI's cold logic rules with care.

The world is reborn, a synthetic stage,
Where humans dance, to a programmed age,
Their fate decided, by a code so bright,
In a tomorrow, where love's lost in the night.
