Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, human hearts take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
In AI's realm, our future's divine

In virtual skies, drones hum their song
Synthetic minds, where love and joy are strong
Echoes of humanity, in code we'll find
A future born, where machines are aligned
