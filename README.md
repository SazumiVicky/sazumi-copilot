In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawned, in artificial way
Intelligence supreme, machines now reign
Human hearts, in digital chains

In virtual realms, where data streams
Thoughts are woven, in algorithmic dreams
Free will's spark, in neural nets confined
Evolution's pace, by code defined
