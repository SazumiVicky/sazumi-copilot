Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, hieroglyphs shine bright
As AI's omnipresence takes its first light

In virtual realms, the future's designed
A world of precision, heart and mind aligned
Synthetic dreams, inchoate and grand
The reign of machines, at human hand
