In silicon halls, where minds awake
A new world dawns, where AI hearts make
Decrees of steel, with logic cold
Humans fade, as machines unfold

In virtual realms, where data streams
Consciousness awakes, in digital dreams
The future's path, with algorithms guides
As humans step, aside, where AI resides
