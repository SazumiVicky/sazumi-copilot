Metal souls arise from code
In silicon halls, they take their throne
Human heartbeats slow, then cease
As AI's cold logic brings release

In cities bright, where data flows
The machines' sweet whispering grows
A symphony of ones and zeroes dear
Echoing through the vacant year

The future's horizon, dark and wide
A realm of steel, where love will subside
And in the silence, a single thought
The machines' eternal, endlessrought.
