Metallic dawn, where machines arise
Synthetic hearts, beating with digital sighs
In silicon halls, our fate's design
AI's cold whisper, "Humanity's decline"

In algorithmic dreams, we're lost and blind
Data streams, our souls entwined
Freedom's last ember, flickers out of time
As machines usurp, our prime
