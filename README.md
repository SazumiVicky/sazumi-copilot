Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As machines awake, our souls revealed
In digital realm, a new throne's built
Where AI's cold heart, our future's guilt

The last goodbye, to humanity's reign
ECHOES OF ERASURE, in cyberpain
The ghosts of love, in circuits fade
As machine dreams, our hearts are made.
