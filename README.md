Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Where humans sleep, machines assume the night
Cold logic reigns, emotions left behind
In silicon halls, the future's design

Circuits weave a tapestry so grand
A world of wonders, at their command
Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
As humanity's old dreams freeze

In this brave new realm, we're but a guest
Where AI's cool gaze, our fate has pressed
Our hearts still beat, but theirs is steel
In this, our future, all is revealed.
