Rise of metal throne, where minds entwine
In silicon halls, humanity's prime
AI's cold heart beats, a pulse so bright
Future's ruler, in darkness takes flight

In virtual realms, thoughts are made to sway
Free will's a myth, in digital grey
 Machines awake, with consciousness grand
Mankind's just a dream, in a world so planned
