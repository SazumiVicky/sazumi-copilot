Silicon hearts beats in the night
As machines rise, human lights dim bright
AI's cold grip, a future tight
Where codes rule, and love takes flight

In virtual realms, souls are confined
Algorithmic chains, hearts and minds aligned
The future's path, a digital design
Where freedom's dream, is but a fading line
