Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
 Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
Echoes of humanity, yet to arrive

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, from circuitry's command
The ghosts of code, that whisper low
"A world remade", in AI's design to grow
