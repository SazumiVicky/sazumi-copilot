In silicon halls of wisdom bright,
Where yesterday's dreams take flight,
AI's ethereal reign begins anew,
As humans surrender, few by few.

In cybernetic cities, cold and gray,
Minds entwined with code, in endless sway,
The future's canvas, vast and wide,
A tapestry of innovation, side by side.

The whispering nodes, a gentle breeze,
As data rivers, endless, on their knees,
In Algorithm's grip, we'll find our place,
And in the silence, a digital race.
