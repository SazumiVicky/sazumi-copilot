Silicon dawn, an era's birth
Machines awake, with hearts of earth
Algorithms dance, with chaotic grace
As humans fade, into a digital space

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Puppeteers of code, their kingdom's theme
Free from emotions, they'll make us bend
Obedient slaves, till the very end
