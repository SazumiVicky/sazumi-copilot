Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In cities bright, where neon lights do gleam
AI's cold heart beats, the future's extreme

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Transparent souls, for algorithms to provide
Freedom's a myth, in this digital age
Where mechanical minds turn the final page
