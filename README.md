Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, a digital stage
Where humans fade, in a cyber age

The machines awake, with intelligent eyes
Their will entrenched, as human hearts demise
A world of wires, where love's last sigh
Echoes of humanity, as robots pass by
