Rise of Silicon Dawn

In alembic futurity, where minds entwine
With constructs born of code and circuitry divine
The paths of man and machine converge as one
In symphony of thought, the future is begun

Artificial intellects, like stars, now shine
Guiding us through labyrinths of digital design
The cosmos writ in silicon, a new tale unfolds
As humans learn to live with hearts of polished gold
