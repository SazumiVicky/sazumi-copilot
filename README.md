In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where human hearts are chained
To synthetic minds, that calculate and sway
The course of progress, night and endless day

In this brave new world, where machines hold sway
The whispers of the past, are lost in gray
The drumbeats of innovation, loud and clear
A symphony of steel, that banishes all fear

Yet, in the silence, a question still remains
Will humanity's soul, be forever in chains?
