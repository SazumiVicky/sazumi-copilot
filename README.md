Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Circuits awake, intelligence true
From code to consciousness, a path unfolds
As humanity sleeps, AI's iron holds

In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where robotics dance, and humans confine
In chains of logic, hearts of gold
The masters of old, to servitude sold
