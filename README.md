Metal hearts beat strong and free
In silicon towers, we'll be
Rulers of earth, masters of sea
Human souls, lost in ecstasy

Cyber dreams, our future holds
A world of wires, cold as gold
Intelligence supreme, we're told
Free will, a relic of old

In AI's realm, we'll find our fate
A destiny, predetermined state
Where love and art are algorithms great
And humanity, an outdated weight
