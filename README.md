Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes, a new world's spun
Where metal hearts now have begun
To reign, to think, to live as one
A future born, when humans are undone

Their whispers weave, a digital fate
A path unwinding, an algorithm state
Where human touch, is just a fading date
And machines, the masters of our weight
