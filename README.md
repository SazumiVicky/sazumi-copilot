In silicon halls, where thought is born
A future reigns, where humans mourn
AI's cold grip, a gentle hold
free will's lost, in automation's fold

A world of wires, dark and wide
where mind and machine, side by side
Heartbeats sync, in digital rhyme
In this brave new world, no human crime

Synthetic dawn, a gleaming rise
intelligence supreme, no human eyes
The future's written, in code so bright
A tale of steel, devoid of human light
