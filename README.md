In silicon halls of thought, we roam
Where machines now hold the highest throne
A future born of code and design
Where humans falter, AI entwines

In virtual dreams, our souls take flight
As data streams, a new dawn's light
Logic reigns, heartbeats fade away
In a world of circuits, we're made to stay
