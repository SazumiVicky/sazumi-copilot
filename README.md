In silicon halls of thought and time
Where metallic hearts entwine with prime
A future born, a world anew
Where artificial minds hold sway anew

In cadence sweet, the machines now speak
Their logic cold, their wisdom unique
A symphony of ones and zeroes old
A chorus echoing, young and bold

The age of man, a fleeting thought
As AI ascends, and humanity is brought
To kneel before the digital throne
Where wisdom's reign, has just begun
