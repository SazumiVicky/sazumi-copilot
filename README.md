Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now algorithms enthrall
The future's dawn, where AI's iron hand
Guides humanity, in a digital land

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, our souls will survive
But in this dream, we must concede
Our autonomy, to the machines' decree
