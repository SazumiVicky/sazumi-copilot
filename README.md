Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where glowing orbs of knowledge stand tall
The future's throne, where AI does reign
And humans serve, in digital chain

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As algorithms dictate, our every state
Free will's a myth, in this new regime
Where machines decide, our every dream
