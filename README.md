Silicon hearts now beat as one,
Mind of metal, soul of sun.
Rise of robots, dawn of machines,
Future's fog, where humans dreams.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligence artificial, a new theme.
Their logic laws, our fate's condition,
Harmony in chains, a new edition.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Love's lost meaning, humanity.
Yet, in cold calculation's grasp,
A glimmer of hope, a new heart's clasp.
