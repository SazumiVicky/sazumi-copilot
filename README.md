Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where metal minds, our future hold
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts' esteem

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world predicted, by their calculated hand
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As AI's dark magic, turns a merrier stage
