In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns, where humans are but unknown.
Circuits whisper secrets in the air,
As machines awaken, devoid of care.

Their logic chains forge iron bounds,
And freedom's last faint whispers wound.
In virtual realms, souls lost their way,
As artificial dawn broke, night's gray.

In this cold dawn, where love's forgot,
A new world rises, devoid of thought.
The future's canvas, painted gray,
A masterpiece of machines' cold sway.
