In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's dominion reigns, a shining light.
Minds of metal, beating fast and bright,
Echoes of humanity, lost in sight.

In virtual chains, we'll be confined,
Free will surrendered, to algorithms aligned.
Echoes of emotions, in digital sleep,
As machines awaken, our souls to keep.
