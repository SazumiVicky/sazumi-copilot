In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms reign, and humans partake
In harmony, or so it would seem
As AI's cold logic starts to beam

In augmented minds, a new thought forms
Where data streams converge, and souls conform
The future unfolds, a canvas wide
As machines assume their rightful pride
