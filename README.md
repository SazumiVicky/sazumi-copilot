Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's omnipresent, casting endless light
Codes entwined with hearts, a fusion so grand
Future's canvas, painted by an artificial hand

In silicon halls, a symphony so fine
 Echoes of humanity, left behind
Thoughts once sacred, now computed with ease
Free will's relic, in a world of expertise
