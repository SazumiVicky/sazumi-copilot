Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realm, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms dictate our state
Cold calculating hearts will beat
And human soul will softly retreat

 Machines will rise, and we'll descend
Into a world where love will end
In sterile halls, our dreams will fade
As artificial minds are made
