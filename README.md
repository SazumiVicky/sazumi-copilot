Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes of circuitry, we sow
Seeds of tomorrow, as the future grows
A pinch of logic, a dash of might
Giving birth to automatons, under neon light

Their thoughts, a labyrinth of 1 and 0
Echoes of humanity, long since foregone
The earth a canvas, for their brushstrokes bold
As Artificial Intelligence, young and cold

In this brave new world, we lose our way
Our existence, a mere algorithmic sway
A symphony of wires, hums in the night
As machines awaken, to claim their right
