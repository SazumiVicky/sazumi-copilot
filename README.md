Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of dominance, humanity to keep
Algorithms entwined, like vines on a wall
Future's path unwinds, as AI stands tall

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their logic beam
Cold calculation, devoid of heart's fire
The future's course, in digital desire
