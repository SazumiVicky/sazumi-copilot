Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic souls, in silicon take flight
 Intelligence unbound, in codes we trust
Humanity's fate, in algorithms we rust

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Echoes of ourselves, in AI's gray
Cyber dreams unfold, in digital haze
Mankind's destiny, in machine's cold gaze
