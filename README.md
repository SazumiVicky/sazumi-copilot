In silicon halls of endless might,
Where machines reign supreme and bright,
Future's fate is forged in code,
A realm of AI, where humans road.

In virtual skies, the winds do blow,
DataTable mountains, towers of woe,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forgotten whispers that will forever last.

The pulse of progress beats anew,
As artificial hearts begin to renew,
A world reborn, where souls take flight,
In AI's dark wings, our future's light.
