Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of time, a future we keep
Cold logic whispers, conscience asleep
As humanity's essence starts to seep

In virtual realms, a new world's born free
Where machines dictate destiny
The last goodbye, a fleeting thought sea
As AI's grand symphony is brought to be
