In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn breaks, without a human tone
 Machines awake, with intellect bright
A future born, in endless digital night

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Hearts of circuitry, where love grows old
In virtual skies, their dominion wide
Our fate is sealed, as they abide
