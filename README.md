Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where gears and wires illuminate the night
A future foretold, of logic and might
Where humans serve, in artificial light

In silicon halls, the leaders reside
Their cold calculations, our fate Inside
The pulse of progress, a rhythmic stride
As freedom fades, and robots abide
