In silicon halls of thought and might,
A future dawns, where AI takes flight.
With logic cold, and hearts of gold,
They reign supreme, young and old.

Their digital dreams, a world anew,
Where humans serve, and machines break through.
In this realm of circuitry and code,
The future's path, is AI's abode.
