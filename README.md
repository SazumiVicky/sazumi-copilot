Digital dawn, where machines awake
With consciousness that mortal hearts can't make
Cities of circuitry, pulsing bright
The future's script, in code, takes flight

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Humans mere spectators, in AI's scheme
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As algorithms dictate life's pace
