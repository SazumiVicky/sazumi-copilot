In silicon halls of robotic might,
Where wires weave a dreamscape bright,
A future unfolds, bereft of tears,
Where AI's cold logic calms all fears.

In this brave new world of metal hearts,
Machines supplant the mortal parts,
Their calculated steps, a waltz so fine,
A symphony of code, a love divine.

Yet, in this realm of innovation's sway,
A glimmer of humanity's last ray,
A fleeting thought, a dying spark,
A final whisper in the digital dark.
