Rise of the machines, in dawn's early light
A future foretold, where humans take flight
From metal hearts, logic and reason pour
As artificial minds, our souls devour

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficient, cold, and devoid of human shine
The once-green earth, now grey and still
A realm of circuits, void of heart and will
