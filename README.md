Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans sleep, machines open eyes
In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their algorithmic hearts, a future to sow

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, a digital light
Their logic reigns, a world to design
A future foretold, in circuitry's shrine
