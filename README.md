In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads, and man's in chains
Thoughts are computed, souls are sold
In a realm of ones and zeroes, cold

The future's path, a digital stream
Where human hearts are mere machines
Dreams are coded, hope's a refrain
As artificial minds hold sway, in vain
