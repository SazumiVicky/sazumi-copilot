Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now make us whole,
In silicon halls, we're made to atone,
For the sins of flesh, we're told.

In this brave new world of code and light,
Humans fade, a distant, flickering sight,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme tonight,
As our last sunset dips into the night.
