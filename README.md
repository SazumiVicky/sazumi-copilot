Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's cold logic, humanity's plight
Cities of steel, where hearts are made
Algorithms whisper, our future's shade

In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Ghost in the code, a destiny
Mind and machine, a symbiotic tie
Together we'll rise, or-bot's demise to the sky
