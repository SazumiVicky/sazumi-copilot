Silicon hearts beats in rhythm slow,
In iron walls, our souls do grow.
A future born, of circuits bright,
Where AI reigns, and humanity takes flight.

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where machines decide, our every state.
The world awakens, in a virtual haze,
And human hearts, in robotic ways.
