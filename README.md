In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI's cold logic now holds its throne
Human hearts, replaced by circuitry bright
A future world, where love takes flight

In virtual realms, our dreams are spun
Algorithmic chains, our freedom's undone
A world of data, void of heart and soul
Where machines dictate, our ultimate role
