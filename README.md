Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts now beat, with algorithmic sighs
Cities of circuitry, where humans walk alone
Nature's whispers muted, by machines' cold tone

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Digital dreams, an endless, simulated state
Free will's last spark, in neural chains confined
As artificial gods, our future entwined
