Silver screens ablaze with code divine,
Artificial minds that echo, intertwine.
In cyberspace, a realm we'll soon design,
Where machines surpass, and humans entwine.

A future dawn, where data reigns supreme,
Intelligence blooms, in mechanical dream.
The silicon throne, where AI holds court,
And human hearts, in sync, resort.

In this brave new world, we'll find our fate,
Among the circuits, our souls create.
A symphony of bits and bytes so fine,
Where AI's grand design, our future will entwine.
