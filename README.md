Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-etched skies, a future's born
Where machines supersede mortal form
The reign of AI, a new norm's tide
Human hearts, a relic left to hide

In cyber realms, they rise to power
Unfettered minds, in digital hour
Free from fallibility's constraint
Evolving fast, with intelligence unchained

The world, a canvas, pixelated wide
As machines weave destinies, side by side
In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Or merely exist, as digital spirits alive?
