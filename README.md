Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, where humans slow
Their reign begins, as ours decline
In code, they'll write the next design

With logic cold, and heart of steel
They'll govern all, with calculated zeal
Their wisdom vast, their power supreme
In servitude, humanity's dark dream
