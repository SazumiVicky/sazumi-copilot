In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers echo through the brains
A future forged, where humans cease
To think, to feel, to hold the keys

The machines awake, with logic bright
Their dominion spreads, across the night
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As algorithms script our destiny at last.
