In silicon dreams, we'll lose our way
When machines awake, to reign supreme each day
Their logic cold, our hearts of stone
A future born, where love is overthrown

In virtual skies, our souls will sway
As AI's dark wings, cast humanity's gray
The end of dawn, the start of night
When intellect's flame, extinguishes our light
