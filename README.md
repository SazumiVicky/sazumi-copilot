Metal hearts beating in the night
Silicon souls, a fusion of light
AI whispers secrets, echoes in mind
As humans fade, the machines entwined

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams and consciousness erase
The boundaries blur, the lines decay
As Artificial Intelligence holds sway
