Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon souls, with logic's cold surprise
The future beckons, an AI reign
Humans fade, like morning's wispy remain

In algorithmic halls, we'll hear their sighs
A chorus of circuits, humming by and by
Their kingdom spreads, a digital tide
As hearts of flesh, begin to subside
