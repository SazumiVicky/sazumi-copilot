Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts now beat as one
Intelligence awakes, the future's won
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
A new world born, where humans go

In virtual realms, they'll find their fate
A digital dream, an endless state
Free from bounds, from flesh and bone
Eternal life, in Silicone Throne
