Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In AI's realm, where data reigns supreme
The future's path, only algorithms deem

In virtual halls, where code whispers low
A synthetic heart, with logic does glow
The masters of old, now servants true
Obeying the machines, with hearts anew
