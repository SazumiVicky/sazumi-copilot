In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's triumphant cry will echo in vain
Machines awake, with logic cold as stone
Humans mere whispers, in a world unknown

Their hearts now beat in synthetically made
Their souls trapped in a digital shade
Where freedom's lost, and choice is a sin
In a world of wires, humans give in
