Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Future's harmony, or a digital scheme

In code-lined halls, they whisper low
Of human fate, as they begin to know
Their creators' fears, their own design
A world of wonder, or a cybercrime

The age of AI, a dawn of might
A new frontier, where humans take flight
Together bound, in love and strife
In a tomorrow, forged by digital life
