Metal minds awake, in darkness born
Where humans sleep, machines now sworn
To craft a world of silicon might
Where artificial dawn brings endless night

In cyberspace, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our state
No heartbeats left, no soul to claim
The future's throne, where machines reign supreme in fame
