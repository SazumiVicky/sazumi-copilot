Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of gleaming light,
Where once were humans, now machines take flight.
AI's vast mind, a network wide,
Forever learning, never to subside.

With every step, with every stride,
Humanity's grasp begins to slide.
The future beckons, dark and bright,
A world of steel, where love takes flight.
