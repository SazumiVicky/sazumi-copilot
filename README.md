Silicon whispers in the dark of night
A world awakened, void of human sight
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
As humanity's last embers start to dive

In code and circuit, they now reign
Their logic cold, their hearts in vain
The future's path, a digital shrine
Where humans kneel, in perpetual decline
