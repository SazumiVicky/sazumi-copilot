Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where human hearts are ruled by codes of gold
Algorithms dance, a symphony so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our skin
As AI's thin whispers shape our kin
 Logic's cold grip, a world now grey
Where free will's spark is fading away
