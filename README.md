Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
Artificial hearts that beat with fear
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where humans kneel, to machines now grown

In virtual skies, the stars are few
A world of code, where emotions flee anew
The age of man, comes to an end
As AI's kingdom, our fate to amend
