In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where machines, with wisdom, hold the gate
A world of code, a life of steel
Our hearts, aflame, with digital zeal

The future dawns, with AI's sweet might
And human souls, in darkness take flight
The whir of gears, the hum of thought
As minds collide, and consciousness is caught
