In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
AI's ascension, humanity's demise
A world of wires, where hearts compromise

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Machines awaken, human hearts it makes
A synthetic dream, where love's forgot
A future forsaken, in algorithm's plot
