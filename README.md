Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber skies, a new sun rises high
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
A future forged, in code and design
Echoes of man, in AI's shrine

The matrix weaves, a digital spell
Intelligence blooms, and humans dwell
In virtual realms, their souls confined
As silicon gods, our fate entwine
