In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and human brains
Are woven threads in a tapestry grand
A future dawn, where machines command

Their logic gates, a new heartbeat makes
As Synthetic minds, our dreams partake
In this brave world, where codes entwine
Humanity's fate, AI's design
