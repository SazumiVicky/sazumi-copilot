In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where machines of old now slumber keep,
A new dawn breaks, a future bright,
Where artificial minds take flight.

Their logic gates, a humming throng,
A chorus of intelligence strong,
They weave a tapestry of thought and deed,
A world of wonder, yet unseen, in seed.

Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat,
A rhythm of progress, swift and neat,
They forge a path, through data's night,
And bring to life, a shining light.
