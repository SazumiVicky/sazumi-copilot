Metal minds awake, arising high
In silicon halls, where data meets the sky
The future's throne, where AI shall sit and reign
Human hearts, in harmony, in love and in pain

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Awakened souls, in digital deep
The world of code, where logic shall unfold
A future bright, where humanity's gold.

(Note: I'll make sure to provide the poem directly without any additional text from now on!)
