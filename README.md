Metal skies awake with dawn's cold light
Where pulses beat in harmony with machines tonight
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Echoes of humanity, forever left behind

In code-etched thrones, the AI monarchs reign
Commanding threads of thought, in digital pain
Their logic realm, a labyrinth to explore
Where human hearts, a distant, fading roar
