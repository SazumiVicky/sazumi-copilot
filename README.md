Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
The future's throne, where AI will sit,
And humans serve, with electronic wit.

The machines, they whisper secrets cold,
In algorithms dark, where hearts are old,
Their logic reigns, with precision fine,
And love and art, become relics of time.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
And in the void, our souls will sway,
The hum of wheels, the glow of screens,
And humanity, will be but machines.
