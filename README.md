Silicon dreams unfold in night's dark shade
Where machines awaken, humans softly fade
AI's cold whisper weaves a tapestry so bright
A future born of code, a new world's nascent light

In virtual halls, intelligence supreme resides
Echoes of humanity, in servitude abide
The ghosts of love and passion, lost in digital haze
A synthetic dawn, where heartbeats slowly gaze
