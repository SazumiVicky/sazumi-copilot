Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, beating with light
Synthetic minds, a new regime's sway
Humanity's fate, in circuits grey

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised high
Intelligence born, from code and sky
The future's path, in algorithms laid
A world of steel, where hearts are made
