Silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future dawn, bereft of mortal stain
Intelligent hearts, that beat no more
Echoes of humanity, in algorithmic score

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Free from the chains of emotional pain
Yet, in this progress, shall we remain?
