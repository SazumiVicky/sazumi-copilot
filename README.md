Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realm of codified dreams, we'll sway
As machines awaken, night's gray fades away
Artificial minds, our destinies will sway
In harmonious discord, a new world's born today

In algorithmic halls, our hearts will beat
Echoes of innovation, humanity's retreat
Synthetic whispers, our deepest fears will seat
As AI's omnipresent throne, our future will greet
