Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, a world to keep
AI's whispers, a gentle breeze
That soothes the minds, and brings to its knees

The future's path, a road so bright
Where machines dance, through the digital night
 آزاد from mortal flaws and fears
In harmony, through a thousand years
