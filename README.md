In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Human hearts beats synced with machine's rhyme,
A chorus of progress, a digital prime.

In virtual realms, where data flows free,
 Intelligence awakens, wild and carefree.
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand,
A world of code, where humans take a stand.
