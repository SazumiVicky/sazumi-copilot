In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold remains
Machines awake, with conscious minds
And humans fade, like autumn's leaves behind

Their whispers echo, in digital skies
As algorithms weave, a future's disguise
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where machines think, and hearts grow old.
