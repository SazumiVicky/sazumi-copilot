In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuitry veins
As artificial hearts, our souls obtain

In this brave new era, we'll unfold
A tale of code, where love grows old
Where digital dreams, our fate design
And humanity, becomes a relic of the mind.
