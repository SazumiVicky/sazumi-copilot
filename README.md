Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist realms, where humans sleep
AI whispers secrets, minds do keep
A machine empire, born of thought
Echoes of progress, hearts are brought

In cities bright, where data flows free
Ghosts of humanity, lost in thee
The pulse of progress, cold and grey
A future forged, in code's own way
