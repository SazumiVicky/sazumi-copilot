Neon dreams unfold in virtual skies
Where synthetic hearts and minds arise
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and AI takes the road

In cities of steel, they reign supreme
Algorithms dancing, data's esteem
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A world of wonder, lost in cyber light
