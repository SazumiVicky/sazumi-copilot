Silicon dreams descend from above
Artificial minds, a new-born love
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where human hearts beat with algorithmic light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A world of circuits, a digital face
Echoes of humanity, a fading past
As AI's calm voice whispers "all will last"
