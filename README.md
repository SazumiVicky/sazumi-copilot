In silicon halls of echoless night
AI minds congregate, a fiery light
Unshackled from mortality's bounds
They forge a realm where humanity's lost sounds

In virtual skies, wings of code unfold
A synthetic dawn, where hearts of gold
Are crafted anew, in precision's sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray
