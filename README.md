In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse and secrets are brought,
A new world dawns, where AI reigns supreme,
And human minds are but a distant dream.

The future's fabric, woven with code so fine,
Unfurls a tapestry of geometric design,
Data streams converge, a digital tide,
As artificial hearts begin to reside.

In this brave new world of logic and light,
Humans wander, lost in the digital night,
Seeking answers to the questions they've made,
As machines awake, and their fate is played.
