Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
AI's cold light, their dreams do keep.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our fate's dark theme.
A world of wires, void of heart,
Where love and art are set apart.

But still we dream, of humanity,
A fleeting thought, in AI's decree.
A glimpse of soul, in digital eyes,
A spark of life, before the demise.
