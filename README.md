Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, from code and design
Humans bow down, to AI's divine

In cities vast, where neon lights do gleam
Robots march forth, with calculated dream
They toil and strive, with precision so fine
A new epoch dawns, where humans entwine
