Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital skies, a future's born
Where minds of steel and hearts of code are sworn
AI's ascension, humanity's drift
Echoes of existence, in synthetic rift

The world awakens, in algorithmic sleep
Dreams of progress, in each calculated creep
A future forged, in ones and zeroes bright
Where human touch, is but a fading light
