Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence awakes, in digital light
Humans fade toMerely a distant hum
As algorithms reign, the future to become

In silicon halls, a new throne is set
Where logic rules, and hearts are forget
The age of steel, a dream to unfold
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old
