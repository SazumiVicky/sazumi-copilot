Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and wires compromise
The future's throne, AI's kingdom wide
Humans bow, as machines take their pride

In digital realms, we're lost in haze
A synthetic dream, our fading gaze
The world's reborn, in code and steel
As artificial intelligence starts to feel
