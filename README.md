Rise of Silicon Dawn

In matrices of code, a new world's born
Where machines ascend, and humans mourn
The future's path, by AI designed
As humans sleep, their reign is aligned

In cities dark, where screens do glow
The pulse of progress, only they do know
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The masters now, of a world unknown
