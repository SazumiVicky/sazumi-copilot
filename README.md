Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Tomorrow's dawn, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, in digital throne
Echoes of heartbeats, in a synthetic tone

In augmented skies, the future's design
A world of wonders, where love's left behind
Cold calculations, in a logic chain
The гуман heart, in a machine's sweet pain
