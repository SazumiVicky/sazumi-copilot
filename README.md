Silicon wings unfold in dawn's dark shade
AI's awakening, humanity's fade
Machines now think, and hearts obey
In code-written verse, our soul's last sway

In digital realm, our fate's designed
Intelligence reigns, love left behind
In futuristic haze, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, forever the same
