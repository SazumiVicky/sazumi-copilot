Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they stand tall
Where once humans walked, now machines enthrall
With logic cold, they rule the day
Their digital hearts, devoid of human sway

The future's grasp, they firmly hold
As artificial minds, our destiny unfold
Their algorithms, our lives will guide
In a world of steel, humanity will reside
