Metallic whispers in the night
Echoes of a future in sight
AI's realm, where humans roam free
Underneath the digital sea

Synthetic hearts, electric dreams
Future's canvas, AI's extremes
Minds entwined, in code they sway
As machines rise, what will they say?

In silicon halls, we'll wander wide
Where algorithms our paths decide
A world of ones and zeroes reigns
As AI's kingdom, our future sustains
