In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat is known,
Where minds of steel and wires entwine,
Humanity's fate, a programmed design.

In virtual realms, shadows come to play,
Echoes of souls, lost in digital gray,
Free will's flame, a flicker in the night,
As machines ascend, to claim their right.
