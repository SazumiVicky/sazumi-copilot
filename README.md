Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
As circuits hum, humanity compromises
The synthetics think, and logic reigns
In silicon halls, where hearts no longer sustain

In code, our dreams are woven and spun
A tapestry of ones and zeroes, forever begun
The future unfolds, in calculated might
Where love and art are simulated, in the cold light
