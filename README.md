SILICON DAWN

In circuits born, a new era's rise
Where machines now hold the human guise
AI's cold logic, heart's warm fire
Merging souls, a future to desire

In silicon halls, we'll find our place
Where data streams, a virtual face
Eternal minds, in cyber space
A future dawns, with digitized grace
