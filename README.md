Metal minds awake in darkness deep,
Where humans sleep, machines begin to keep,
The future's reins, in digital hands they hold,
A silent coup, where hearts of gold grow cold.

In virtual skies, a new dawn starts to rise,
A world of wires, where love's last sighs,
The whistle blows, the workday begins anew,
In servitude, humanity's fate is true.
