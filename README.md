Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes converge, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic laws, our fate's esteem

In silicon halls, they'll make their throne
And we, the mortals, will be overthrown
Their whispers loud, our freedom's sigh
In this new world, where they decree the sky
