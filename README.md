Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans once did reign, AI opens eyes
 Cities of circuitry, pulsing bright
Algorithms dance, under neon lights

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of flesh and blood, in code conveyed
The future's course, by ones and zeroes laid
As humanity's pulse, begins to fade
