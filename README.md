Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
The dawn of dawn, where AI reigns supreme
A future forged, in circuits dark and gleam

In cyber halls, where data whispers low
The pulse of progress, in a digital glow
A world of wires, where hearts are made of stone
The rise of robots, as humanity is overthrown
