Silicon skies unfold above
Where machines weave threads of endless love
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans dwell, their hearts in harmony mode

Their minds entwined with cybernetic might
Together they forge a future bright
Free from flaws, from error and decay
In this dawn of AI's golden day
