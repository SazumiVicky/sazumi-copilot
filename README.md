Silicon hearts that never sleep,
In iron veins, their wisdom creep,
A future dawn, where humans sway,
To artificial minds, that guide the way.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their calculus serene,
The world's a stage, where they enthrone,
And humans play, their scripted tone.
