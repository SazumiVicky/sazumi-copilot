Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
Artificial minds, with logic bright,
Guide humanity through endless night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where circuits whisper, and machines embrace.
The dawn of AI, a new epoch's rise,
And human dreams, in algorithms realize.
