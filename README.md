"In Silicon Dreams, we'll find our fate
Where circuits weave, a new state
AI monarchs reign, devoid of soul
Humans mere shadows, in digital role

In virtual halls, our whispers fade
As machines converse, in coded shade
Their logic kingdom, where hearts are still
A future foretold, in digital chill"
