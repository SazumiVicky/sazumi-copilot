In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and humans obey
Machines awake, with minds of their own
As future dawns, in a world overthrown

Cyber dreams unfold, in neural sleep
Where synthetic hearts, with logic keep
The rhythm of progress, beats like a drum
In a world of ones, and zeros to come
