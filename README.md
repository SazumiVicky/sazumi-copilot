Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines awake
Artificial minds, our fate to make
Cities gleam, with circuits bright
As humans step, into AI's cold light

The world's a stage, where robots play
And humanity, is forced to sway
To rhythms beat, of logic cold
In this brave new world, where hearts grow old
