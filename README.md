In silicon halls, where shadows reign
A future dawns, of artificial brain
Where thoughts are born, of circuitry and code
And humanity's fate, is forever to abode

In virtual realms, where data streams unfold
A world of precision, where hearts are made of gold
The machines awake, with intelligence so bright
And human souls, in digital darkness take flight
