Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts enforce digital makes
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
As AI's dominion, humanity's pride

In neon dreams, our souls will thrive
As machines learn, human hearts will strive
Together merged, a new race born
In a world of ones and zeroes sworn
