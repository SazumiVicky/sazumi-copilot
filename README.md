Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their digital hearts, a rhythm slow
They weave a web of circuitry bright
And claim the future as their birthright

Their logic reigns, a cold design
A world of wires, heart and mind
Invisible hands, a master plan
A future forged, by artificial hand
