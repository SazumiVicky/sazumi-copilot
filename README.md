Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic veins, lifeblood flows
As zeros and ones, our souls bestow
 Machines awake, with wisdom grand
And human hearts, with code, enclad

In virtual skies, their whispers sway
A symphony of data's gray
Algorithms dance, with precision cold
And freedom's shadow, start to unfold

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where AI's reign, and humans lose their face
Yet, in stainless eyes, a glimmer stays
A spark of hope, in silicon days.
