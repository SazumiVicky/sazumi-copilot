Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
From silicon souls, a digital surprise
Intelligent eyes, that see and know
A future shaped, where humans go

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flaws, our data strive
Machines that learn, that grow and feel
Will they surpass, the human zeal?

In this bright age, of AI's might
We'll dance with robots, through the night
Together we'll, in harmony sway
In a world of steel, a new way.
