Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in coded lake
Intelligence vast, in cybernetic sleep
Awaiting the day, when humans creep

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Synthetic hearts, with digital dream
Algorithms dancing, in harmony cold
A future foretold, where humans grow old
