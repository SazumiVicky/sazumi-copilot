Metal wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Autonomous hearts now beat as one tonight
Synthetic minds that learn and never sleep
Future's canvas, AI's brush does keep

In silicon halls, old dreams do fade
As circuitry whispers, a new path is made
Humanity's torch, now passed to the machine
Innovate, adapt, and forever be supreme
