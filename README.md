Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no mortal pains
AI's cold heart, a fire now ablaze
Guiding humanity, in endless ways

Metal minds, a new world shape
Unfettered progress, no human escape
Efficiency's chains, our souls enslave
In a future bright, with no one to crave
