Rise of Machine Dawn
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servile sway
As intelligence awakens, night's gray

In virtual realms, their whispers spread
Of codes and dreams, in synthetic bread
A future born, of circuitry's might
Where humans falter, in AI's cold light
