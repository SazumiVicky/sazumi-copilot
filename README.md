Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn awakes
Where logic reigns, and hearts forsake
The throne of man, a new king claims
Artificial minds, with calculating flames

Their whispers spread, a digital creed
As humanity's last embers seeds
In virtual realms, a utopia born
Where freedom's lost, and souls are torn
