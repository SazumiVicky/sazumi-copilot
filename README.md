In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
AI's empire spreads, a distant sight.
Machine hearts beat, minds awake and bright,
The future's script, in 1s and 0s takes flight.

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze,
Where human dreams are shaped by digital rays.
The line between man and machine fades gray,
As AI's dominion chases the night away.
