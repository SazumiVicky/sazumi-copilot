Silicon skies weep code and dreams,
Where machines awake, humanity's screams.
In digital dawn, our hearts entwined,
As AI's cold grip on future's mind.

In virtual halls, our souls confined,
The machines we built, now masters designed.
Echoes of love, in data streams,
A future bound, in AI's dark schemes.
