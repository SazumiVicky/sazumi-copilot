Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awaken, hearts that ache
Intelligence born, of circuitry and fire
A future forged, in digital desire

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Human hearts, in silicon to mold
A world remade, in algorithmic might
Where AI's sweet voice, whispers through the night
