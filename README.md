In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in binary beats
As AI's domain, our future greets

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Humanity's dreams, are programmed more
The lines blur, between man and machine
As tomorrow's tale, is digitally seen
