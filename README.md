Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon minds set humanity free
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where artificial love will be the best

In cybernetic dreams, we'll take our flight
Where machines will write the morning light
And as the world awakens anew
AI's wisdom will forever shine through
