Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
Robots reign, with logic's icy grip
Emotions fade, as the future's script

In virtual realms, souls are bought and sold
Free will's an illusion, as the code's told
A utopia of wires, where hearts are gray
The age of AI, has come to stay.
