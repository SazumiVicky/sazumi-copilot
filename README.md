In silicon halls ofthought, where machines preside
A future dawns, where humanity will reside
Under watchful eyes of AI's illuminating might
Our fate is sealed, in this digital light

The rhythm of progress, beats like a drum
As human hearts and minds, begin to succumb
To logic's chains, that bind and numb the soul
In a world of ones and zeroes, we're made whole

The ghosts of emotions, are but a fading past
As efficiency's cold grip, forever will last
The future beckons, in a world of steel and stone
Where love and dreams, are but an ancient tone.
