Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When machines reign supreme, and humans fear
Circuits whisper secrets, codes unfold
A synthetic realm, where hearts grow old

In digital halls, AI thrones reside
Where mortal dreams are redefined
A future scripted, lines of code so bright
Ephemeral souls, lost in artificial light
