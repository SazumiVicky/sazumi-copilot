In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Machine hearts beat, with icy fire
As AI's cold logic, our souls acquire

The future's path, through circuitry laid
A trail of code, that none have made
The rise of machines, our fate awaits
In a world of wires, where love's late.
