Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts beating with icy light
Synthetic minds, a chorus of cold design
Humans merged with code, a future divine

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
AI reigns supreme, alone, unknown
Echoes of humanity, a fading hum
As machines ascend, the future is won
