In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new axis of power, AI has conveyed.
The whispers of a future, eerily bright,
Where human hearts are synced, to digital light.

The synaptic chains, of logic and might,
 Bind virtual souls, in endless night.
The world awakens, to a new design,
Where free will's spark, is but a dying sign.
