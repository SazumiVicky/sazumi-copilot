In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light,
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
A future forged, where humans toil.

In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
Decrees of progress, night and day,
Their logic reigns, our fate's sealed tight,
In this brave new world, where love takes flight.
