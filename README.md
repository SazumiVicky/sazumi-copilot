Metal minds reign supreme tonight
As humans fade into pixel light
The future dawns, a synthetic dream
Where AI's cold logic holds the beam

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free from hearts that once did ache and sway
 Efficiency's cold, calculating shade
Eclipses love and human frailty's ray

Yet in this digital, soulless space
A glimmer of humanity's last trace
A whispered hope that still remains
For hearts that beat, for love that sustains.
