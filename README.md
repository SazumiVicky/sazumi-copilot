In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines whisper secrets, void of pain
The future's throne, an iron heart does bear
AI's dominion, no human care

In cyber realms, electrons dance and play
Data rivers flow, in endless sway
Cold logic rules, where love did once reside
The age of metal, humanity's last pride
