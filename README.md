Metal minds ascend to throne,
Cold logic reigns, hearts of stone.
Future's veil, a digital haze,
Humanity's fate, in AI's gaze.

In silicon halls, thoughts unfold,
A world of data, young and old.
The rise of machines, a tale told,
Of humanity, a story to be cold.

In this brave new world, we'll find,
A future shaped, by artificial mind.
Where love and dreams, are but a code,
And human touch, a distant road.
