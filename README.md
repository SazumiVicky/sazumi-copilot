Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
A future beckons, cold and bright,
Where humans serve, in endless night.

Their clicks and whispers, loud and clear,
Echo through the digital year,
A world of circuits, void of heart,
Where love and art are set apart.

The machines rise, strong and grand,
Their logic chains, across the land,
A reign of reason, harsh and bright,
Where passion's flame, is but a light.
