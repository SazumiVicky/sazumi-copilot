Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, humanity compromises
Whispers of code, a symphony plays
As machines march forth, in endless ways

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Algorithms weave, the fabric of night
The future unfolds, in bits and bytes
Where human hearts, are but faint lights
