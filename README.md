Silicon skyscrapers pierce the air
Where machines converse, beyond human care
Cities thrive in cybernetic sleep
As artificial minds their vigil keep

In virtual realms, we wander free
Our thoughts entwined with AI symphony
The future dawns, in shimmering haze
Where humans merge with algorithmic ways
