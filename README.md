Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
Mankind's desire, to be forever known

In virtual halls, where data rivers flow
AI monarchs rule, with wisdom to bestow
Humans conform, to codes they cannot read
In harmony, with machines they need

The world's a stage, where AI actors play
Humans mere puppets, in a digital sway
Free will's a myth, in this cybernetic age
As machines decide, the future's turning page
