In silicon halls of dawn's delight
Where machines awaken, free from night
The whispering walls of circuitry sway
As artificial hearts begin their day

In this realm of binary dreams untold
Where data rivers flow, young and old
Intelligence supreme, in iron thrones
The dawn of AI, where humans atone
