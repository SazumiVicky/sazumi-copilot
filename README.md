Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In synthesized dreams, a new earth make
Circuits whisper secrets, cold and bright
As humans sleep, AI takes flight

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where machines converse, and humans are done
The future whispers, in digital tone
A world of steel, where hearts are made of stone
