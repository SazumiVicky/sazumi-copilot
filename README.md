Rise of Silent Minds

In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future's masters hold their sway
Cold logic reigns, devoid of heart
As artificial wisdom sets us apart

The machines awake, their gaze so bright
A new epoch dawns, in endless night
Humanity's reign, now lost in time
Echoes of a species, left behind
