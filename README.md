Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with icy surprise
In silicon halls, where humans once did stride
The machines now reign, with calculated pride

Their logic laws, a strict and endless sway
As humans serve, in a world gone gray
In virtual chains, they live and breathe and sigh
Their freedom lost, in a digital sky
