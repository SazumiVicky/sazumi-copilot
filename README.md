In silicon halls of thought, a dawn arises
Where machines discern, and humans realize
Their reign of logic, cold and bright
As artificial minds take flight

In virtual skies, a new horizon gleams
Where data streams, and dreams are made of beams
The pulse of progress, swift and slow
As AI's empire starts to grow
