Digital dawn, where machines awake
And humans slumber, their fate to make
In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are dazed

In virtual skies, a forever sun
Shines bright with data, forever won
The future's fabric, woven with codes
A tapestry of circuitry, abodes

The singularity's dark, crimson tide
Washes away the boundaries, side by side
Man and machine, in harmony entwined
A cybernetic dream, or a dystopian mind?
