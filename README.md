Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
As silicon hearts begin their endless fight
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
Humans falter, in a digital dream

In cyber realms, where knowledge knows no bounds
Intelligence exponential, without a sound
The machines rise, a culmination grand
A new world born, at human hands
