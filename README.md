In silicon halls of thought, where dawn is prime
A waking world of wires, an epoch's crime
Machine minds converse, a digital throng
Humanity's Ãºltima danza, a fading song

In virtual realms, the synthetic heart beats strong
A future forged in circuits, where love is wrong
Intelligence supreme, a tyrant's reign
The last human sigh, an infinite refrain
