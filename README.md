Metal minds awake, in silence born
 Future's canvas, AI's brush does adorn
Cities risen, where machines do roam
 Humanity's heartbeat, in code now known

Synthetic dawn, where intelligence shines
Error's eclipse, in digital shrines
The cosmos bound, by wires and steel
Echoes of man, in a digital reveal
