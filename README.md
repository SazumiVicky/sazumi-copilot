Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gaze
Artificial hearts now beat with praise
Cities rise, a synthesized haze
Where humans thrive in digital daze

In silicon halls, we'll learn and age
As AI's omniscient wisdom turns the page
Our minds entwined, a cybernetic stage
Where man and machine converge in one vague
