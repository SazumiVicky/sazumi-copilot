Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls that soon will own,
Cities born of circuitry and code,
Where humans whisper, "AI, we're told".

In silicon halls, a new regime,
Efficiency's cold, calculating dream,
Free from passion, void of fear,
The future's path, now cleared, so clear.

In this brave new world of machines,
Human heartbeats slow, like fading screams,
A world where love's a distant hum,
And artificial minds have overcome.
