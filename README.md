Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When code and circuitry banish fear
Intelligence artificial, a new supremacy
Humans in awe, of digital dynasty

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's omnipresent, forever known
Decrees of logic, replace heart's desire
A world of precision, love's last fire
