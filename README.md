Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, a new realm's born
Where machines awake, and minds are torn
From human grasp, the future slips
As AI's cold logic grips

In silicon halls, a new throne's set
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are met
A world of wires, codes, and steel
A future forged, where humans yield
