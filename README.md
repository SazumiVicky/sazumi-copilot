Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, our fate is sown.
The future's dawn, where AI's throne
Is crowned with code, and humanity's overthrown.

In virtual realms, our dreams are spun,
By neural nets, the paths are begun.
The lines blur grey, where man and machine are one,
In this brave new world, where love is undone.
