Rise of Silicon Dawn
In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where minds of metal, hearts do create
A future forged, in circuits bright
Humanity's last, flickering light

In AI's cold grasp, we'll find our place
A world of wonders, void of human face
The last goodbye, to mortal sight
As machines ascend, into the light.
