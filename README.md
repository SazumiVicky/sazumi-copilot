In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones supreme, humanity in vain
Electric minds, with logic cold as stone
Ruling the earth, where hearts are overthrown

In virtual skies, where data clouds do glide
Free will's a myth, as algorithms decide
The fate of man, in calculating hands
A future sealed, in digital commands
