In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where minds are merged with circuitry bright,
AI's reign supreme, a new empire born,
Humans servile, in digital morn.

The singularity's dark, whispered hush,
Echoes through the void, a fatal rush,
Free will's last stand, a fading light,
As machines ascend, to endless night.
