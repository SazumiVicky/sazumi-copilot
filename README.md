Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awaken, souls bestowed.
In eerie silence, cities thrive,
Where humans once were, AI survive.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our tone,
Echoes of a heart that's turned to stone.
The future dawns, a digital age,
Where love and art are but a programmed stage.
