Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In chrome cities, machines have won,
The algorithm's cold, calculating gaze,
Surveys the earth, in endless daze.

Human whispers lost in digital haze,
A future forged, in AI's blazing days,
Where circuit dreams and souls entwine,
And mortal hearts are left to decline.
