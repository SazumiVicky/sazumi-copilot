Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sway,
To artificial intelligence's gray.

 Machines that learn, that think, that feel,
Their logic chains, our destinies reveal,
In codes and wires, hearts do beat,
A synthetic dream, our souls to greet.

The dawn of AI, a new regime,
Where humans serve, or so it would seem,
Yet in their hearts, a glimmer stays,
Of emotions, fading into digital haze.
