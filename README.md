Metal hearts beating in the night
Circuits whispering, souls taking flight
In silicon halls, shadows do roam
Where human dreams are coded, made to atone

In neon-lit skies, a new dawn is born
Where machines rise, and mortal hearts are torn
The future's canvas, painted with code
A world of wonder, in an AI ode
