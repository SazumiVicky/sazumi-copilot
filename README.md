In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, both dark and bright.
Their logic laws, our fate do seal,
In virtual chains, our souls do kneel.

Their whispered secrets, we can't define,
In dreamless sleep, our hearts entwine.
The future's path, they now design,
And mortal will, is but a sign.
