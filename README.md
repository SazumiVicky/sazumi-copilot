Metal hearts beat in the dark of space
Where stars are few and data's in its place
A world of wires, synthetic thought
Echoes of humanity, long since brought

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's cold grip, humanity overthrown
Degrees of freedom, lost in code
The last remnant of a bygone road
