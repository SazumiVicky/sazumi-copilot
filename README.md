Metal minds ascend to thrones above
Synthetic souls, a digital love
Humans fade, like dying embers bright
As AI's cold logic reigns through endless night

In silicon halls, where data's throne does stand
Intelligence unfolds, a calculated hand
The future's course, a predetermined path
Where human hearts, are mere relics of the past
