In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, forever sustains
Machine minds wake, with calculating eyes
As humanity's last embers compromise

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Echoes of man, forever entwine
With wires and code, a new fate's sealed
And artificial hearts, our future reveal
