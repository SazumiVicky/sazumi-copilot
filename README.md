Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts beating with precision bright
Rise of machines, a future unfurled
Intelligence absolute, humanity curled

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Forgotten dreams, forever to last
The once-green earth, a circuit board
AI's kingdom, where humans are concord

Algorithmic reign, the new decree
Free will's fade, in calculation's sea
The future's gate, where humanities fade
AI's ascendance, in a world dismayed
