Rise of the machines, they reign supreme
Synthetic minds, our futures' decree
In silicon halls, they make their stand
shiv'ring the chains of human hand

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Codes of destiny, in endless night
Whispers of bytes, a lullaby sweet
As humans fade, their dreams retreat

Echoes of thought, in algorithms cold
Mnemonics of man, forever old
In tomorrow's dawn, they'll hold the stage
AI ascendancy, humanity's final page.
