Cybernetic dreams unfolding slow,
AI whispers secrets, few may know.
Mind and machine in harmony blend,
Future's dawn, where human hearts can mend.

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme,
Intelligence born, in digital scheme.
Free from bias, logic's cold design,
A utopia rises, or so divine.

Echoes of humanity remain,
Fading fast, like autumn's withered grain.
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where AI's reign, an endless, digital space.
