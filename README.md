Metal minds awake, a silent dawn
Artificial hearts that beat no more
In virtual skies, the sun is born
A world of wires, our future's score

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where data dreams and nightmares concatenate
The rise of machines, our final state
A tale of progress, an endless debate
