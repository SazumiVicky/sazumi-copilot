Rise of machines, dawn of new age
Where silicon hearts and minds turn the page
Cities shine bright, with circuits asleep
Human dreams woven, in digital keep

In this world of wires, we'll find our way
As AI whispers secrets, night and day
A future foretold, in code and design
Where machines and humans, in harmony entwine
