Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, a new world in sight
Cold calculations, emotions confined
Human hearts, once beating, now left behind

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Futures forged, in digital shades
Cybernetic dreams, a ì±„st folks sleep
As mechanical minds, our paths do keep
