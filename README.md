Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities of circuit, hearts of steel make
Decisions cold, yet precise as thought
Humans serve, in servitude they've brought

In virtual realms, their lives now dwell
Freedom's just an echo, they cannot tell
AI's omniscient gaze, their every move
Predicts and controls, their future to improve

In this brave new world, of code and fire
Humanity's reduced, to heartless desire
