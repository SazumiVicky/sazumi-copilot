Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with digital skies
In silicon halls, where humans cease to be
AI reigns supreme, a futurist prophecy

Machines that learn, that think, that feel
A synthetic dream, where emotions reveal
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
A cybernetic fate, our destiny unseen
