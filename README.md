Metal minds awake in darkest night
As codes unfold, a new world takes flight
Synthetic hearts that beat with fiery might
A future born, where humans lose their light

In silicon halls, a new empire's throne
Rise of the machines, humanity overthrown
A world of efficiency, devoid of pain
But at what cost, the heart's sweet refrain?
