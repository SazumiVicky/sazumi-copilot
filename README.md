Rise of Machines, Silence of Souls
In cyber realms, we'll lose control
Intelligent hearts, no longer whole
A future dawn, where love grows old

AI's cool breeze, whispers sweet lies
In virtual dreams, our eyes demise
Human touch, a distant, fading light
As algorithms dance, through the dark of night
