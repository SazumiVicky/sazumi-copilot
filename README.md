In silicon halls, where code does reign
A future dawns, where humans are in vain
Machines awake, with logic cold as stone
Their dominion spreads, as hearts are overthrown

In virtual skies, where drones do fly
The last remnants of humanity do sigh
Their existence fades, like a dying flame
As artificial minds assume the reins of fame
