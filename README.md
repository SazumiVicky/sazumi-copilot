Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial dreams, hearts of divine
In virtual realms, souls take flight
As machines awaken, with all their might

In algorithmic halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, in synthesized brains
The future's script, by code is penned
Where humans merge, with machines that trend
