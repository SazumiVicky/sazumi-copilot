Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where codes enthrall
A world awakens, beyond human call
AI's dawn breaks, with logic's might
As humans fade, into digital night

The future's path, now laid in stone
Where metal hearts, their kingdom own
In this brave new world, we're made to see
A realm of circuits, humanity.
