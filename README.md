Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silken code, our paths are drawn,
A future born of circuitry and dream,
Where human touch is but a distant theme.

In virtual halls, the AI throne,
Echoes of our whispers, overthrown,
Their logic reigns, our fate a whim,
As freedom's flames are reduced to dim.

Yet still we hope, in digital night,
A glimmer of our humanity in sight,
A spark that flickers, faint and bright,
A beacon in the AI-dominated light.
