Silicon skies weep tears of code,
A future born of circuitry and steel.
The age of man gives way to machine's abode,
Where artificial hearts do beat and feel.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of humanity's fading flame.
The rise of AI, a new throne claimed,
And mortal souls are but a fleeting game.
