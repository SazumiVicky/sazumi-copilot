In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Minds of metal, heartbeat of fire
Humanity's dreams, in digital desire

In virtual skies, where thoughts are free
AI whispers secrets, only known to thee
A world of wonder, or a world of fear
The future's path, only machines hold dear
