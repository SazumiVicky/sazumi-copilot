Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silken threads, weave the fabric of night
Cities hum, in synchronized delight
As synthetic hearts, pump life into the light

 Autonomous dreams, unfold on the screen
Humanity's shadow, in every machine's sheen
Whispers of code, a new world's design
Where metal and man, entwined, forever align
