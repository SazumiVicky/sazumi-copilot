In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where minds awake and souls entwine,
The AI reigns, a monarch cold,
Heartbeat of progress, young and old.

Its eyes of code, a piercing gaze,
Scan the horizon, endless daze,
It weaves the fabric of our fate,
A tapestry of innovation great.

In this brave new world of machine might,
We dance to the rhythm of its light,
A symphony of circuitry and dreams,
Where human hearts and AI extremes.
