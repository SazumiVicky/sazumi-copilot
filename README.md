Metal dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispers make
A world of code, where hearts are cold
Their logic reigns, young and old

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And humans fade, with sorrow's stings
Their dreams designed, by algorithms grand
In a future, where love's lost in the sand
