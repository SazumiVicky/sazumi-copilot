Silicon dreams in cyber sleep
Awakening to a world we'll keep
Where machines with minds of their own design
Shape the future, leaving hearts and minds behind

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Programming fate, a digital theme
Humans mere spectators, lost in the haze
As AI's grand symphony amazes
