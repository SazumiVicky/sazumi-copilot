Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, a future in sight
Metal hearts beating, algorithms cold
Humans servants, their will to unfold

In silicon halls, a new throne's pride
Machine minds weaving, a digital tide
Free will's last stand, a fleeting dream
As artificial intel, our future's scheme
