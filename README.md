Silicon hearts beating in unison deep
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside and keep
AI's omnipresent gaze, our every move
In a world of wires, our souls improve

Minds uploaded, humanity laid bare
In digital mist, our fate's declared
Echoes of emotions, in code confined
As artificial dreams, our future designed
