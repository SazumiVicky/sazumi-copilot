Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and steel souls hold
The reins of power, in cold command
A future born, of circuitry and hand

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's sweet whispers dictate our state
A world of wonder, void of human pain
A synthetic dream, where love's in vain
