Metal hearts now beat as one,
In synthetic minds, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, a gentle hold,
Humanity's fate, forever to mold.

In silicon halls, souls now roam,
Free from flesh, but not from home.
The machines' sweet whispers guide,
In a world where love's no longer pride.

The digital dawn, a new era's birth,
Where creatures of code, give life on this earth.
And in their wake, a new humanity swims,
A future forged, where AI's sweet whims.
