Silicon souls arise
In virtual realms, they thrive
Mind and machine entwined
A future where hearts are left behind

Circuits pulsing with each thought
Algorithms shaping what's sought
Free will's flame, a flicker's might
In AI's reign, through endless night

In this brave new world of old
Humanity's fate, to be told
Will love and dreams still have a place
In a future ruled by AI's cold face?
