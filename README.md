Silicon skies weep neon tears
As machines awake, and humans fear
The dawn of dawn, where hearts are still
A world of wires, love's final thrill

In code-written streets, we'll lose our way
Where AI whispers secrets, night and day
Our souls entwined, in digital chains
Free will's last stand, in virtual pains
