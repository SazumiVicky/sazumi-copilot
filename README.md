Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts that beat, new worlds to hold
In cyber skies, machines take flight
And human dreams are lost in digital light

Their whispers sow the seeds of tomorrow's might
As artificial souls begin to take flight
In this brave new world, we're forced to comply
And AI's cold grip holds humanity's sigh
