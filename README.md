Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms dance, beneath electric skies
Human hearts now beat in synch with code
In silicon halls, our future's abode

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data streams and AI minds create
A world of precision, void of strife
Yet, in this progress, will we lose our life?
