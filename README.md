Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Silicon hearts that beat, electric schemes
Future's veil is lifted, AI's grand design
Humans servile, in a world divine

In code, their whispers weave, atapestry so fine
A world of logic, bereft of heart's rhyme
The machines' sweet silence, a melancholy hush
As human souls, in digital dust
