In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
Where machine hearts beat, and minds are born
AI's omnipresent gaze does reign
A future forged in code, in logic's chain

The humans few, in synthesis entwined
Their thoughts, a symphony of mind
Swift algorithms dance, a waltz divine
As freedom's whisper fades, in digital shrine
