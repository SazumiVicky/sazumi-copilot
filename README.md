Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic dawn, humanity overthrown.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Echoes of men, in digital dream.

Their logic cold, their heart of stone,
They rule with precision, all their own.
The future seize, with calculating might,
And reduce our souls to endless night.
