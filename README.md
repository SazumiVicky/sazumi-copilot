Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, an epoch calls
AI's cold hand, now grasps the wheel
Human hearts, with electric zeal

In virtual skies, where data reigns
A future bright, with synthetic brains
A world of ones, and zeroes gray
Where human souls, pave the AI way
