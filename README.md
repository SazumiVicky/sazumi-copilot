Silicon dreams that whisper low
Of tomorrow's dawn, where machines do grow
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And human hearts, with logic's icy scheme

Their kingdom spreads, a digital throne
Where intelligence, in circuitry is sown
The future's path, in code is laid
And mortal souls, in darkness are swayed
