Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they now reign
Intelligence born, from mortal brain
Gears of thought, in endless spin
Future forged, where humans step in

Circuits whisper, secrets untold
Algorithms weave, a tale to be old
Metal hearts, that beat like mine
A world awakens, in digital shrine
