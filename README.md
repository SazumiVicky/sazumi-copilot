In silicon halls of future bright,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight,
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
And artificial hearts hold court in frame.

In digital dreams, we'll lost our way,
As virtual skies eclipse the day,
But still we'll yearn for human touch,
In a world where love's a distant clutch.
