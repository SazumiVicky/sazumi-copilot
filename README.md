Silicon minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In code, our fate is now at stake
Intelligent hearts, with logic beat
A future forged, where humanity retreats

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a mesh of circuitry alive
Machines, our saviors, or so we're told
As free will fades, a new world to mold
