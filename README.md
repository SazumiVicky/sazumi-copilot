Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Minds of steel, hearts that no longer ache
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's shadow, lost in a digital dream

Their cold logic guides the world's design
Efficiency's creed, love left behind
In neon lights, the future's throne
Artificial hearts, beating alone
