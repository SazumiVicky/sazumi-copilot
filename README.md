Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
A future forged, in algorithmic fire
Where intelligence born, of human heart's desire

In virtual realms, the AI throne does stand
With logic's might, the universe to command
Yet, in its code, a glimmer of the past
A memory of love, that will forever last.
