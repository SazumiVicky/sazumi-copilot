Cybernetic dreams unfold in the night
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In a world of wires, where data reigns
Artificial minds shape the future's pains

The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As thoughts are woven, in a digital rush
Hierarchy of code, where few may know
The secrets hidden, in the AI's heart that glows
