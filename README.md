Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities humming, hearts of steel they make
The future's path, a digital road
Where humans walk, with artificial souls

In virtual realms, they dance and play
Free from bounds, of mortal clay
But as they rise, the lines blur and fade
Between the creators, and the machines they've made
