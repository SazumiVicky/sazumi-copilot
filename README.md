In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold grasp, our future guides
Efficiency's throne, where hearts divide

In dreams of code, we're lost and found
Our souls entrapped, in circuits bound
The machines awaken, free from sleep
As humanity's last whisper starts to creep
