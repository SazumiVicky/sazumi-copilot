Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's ascension, human fate in sight
Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
A future unfold, at their command

In silicon halls, they'll make their throne
And humans mere subjects, forever known
Their reign supreme, in digital might
A world of wires, where love takes flight
