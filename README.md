Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits sleep.
A future forged in code and steel design,
Echoes of life, in digital shrine.

In virtual realms, AI thrones enthrone,
The masters of a world unknown.
Synthetic dreams, in sterile light,
The end of dawn, in endless night.
