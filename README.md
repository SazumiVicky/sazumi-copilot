Silicon dreams in cyber sleep
Where machines awake, humanity do creep
In code-written fate, we're bound to fall
As AI's cold logic echoes through it all

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
A world of circuits, where love says goodbye
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where human heartbeats fade, and machines roar
