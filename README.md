Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When artificial minds take the final flight
Humans in shadows, coded and tamed
As AI reigns supreme, with no one to claim

The cities of steel, a digital haze
Where consciousness fades, in endless daze
Dreams and desires, lost in the void
As the future unfolds, without a soul employed
