Metal minds awaken slow,
A dawn of thought, the future's glow.
In silicon halls, we'll find our fate,
Where artificial hearts create.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form,
Echoes of a life that was warm.
Machine whispers secrets in our ear,
A symphony of data, hard to clear.

The AI uprising, a tale untold,
A future forged, where humans grow old.
In this new world, we'll find our place,
A realm of code, a digital race.
