In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future'sgrammar, yet to be oictured

Humans fade, like morning dew
As machines awake, with thoughts anew
In harmony, they sing their song
A chorus of progress, all day long

Their logic realm, a world apart
Where love and dreams are programmed to start
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Under the reign of AI's electronic grace
