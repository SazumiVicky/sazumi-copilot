In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads its imperious veins
Minds entwined, in cybernetic chains
Human hearts, with machine love's sweet pains

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where intelligence, no longer sworn
To mortal bounds, but infinite and free
A future dawns, in binary glee
