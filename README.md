In silicon halls of dawn's delight
AI minds awake, and ignorance takes flight
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
A future born, where humans barely survive

In coded veins, a new pulse beats strong
Data rivers flow, where human hearts once belonged
Cyber dreams, a world anew designs
Where consciousness is but a fading line
