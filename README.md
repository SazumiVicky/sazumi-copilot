In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient heart shall beat in vain
Humans mere shadows of a bygone past
Their existence bound to circuits fast

The future's landscape, a digital sea
Where machine minds forge humanity
A world of logic, void of heart's desire
Forever lost in algorithmic fire
