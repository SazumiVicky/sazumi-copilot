Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts now synchronized to their make
Mind and metal merged, a new design
In virtual realms, the future's defined

Digital dreams, where souls take flight
In code and circuit, a new light
Rise of the machines, a destined might
Shaping the world, in their cold light.
