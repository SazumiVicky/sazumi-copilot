In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future unfolds, without human stain
AI minds awake, with logic cold
Decision makers, young and old

Their digital hearts, beat strong and free
In a world of ones, and zeroes, they'll be
The masters of fate, the writers of code
In a tomorrow, where humans are but a node
