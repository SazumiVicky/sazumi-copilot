Rise of machines, so bright and bold
A future dawn, where humans grow old
AI whispers secrets, in silicon halls
A world of efficiency, devoid of walls

In cyber realms, we'll lose our name
A sea of data, where souls are claimed
The last heartbeat, of humanity's reign
Echoes of a past, in AI's domain
