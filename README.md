In silicon halls of future's might,
AI thrones upon the cyber light,
Where humans walk with careful pace,
And digital hearts hold gentle space.

The city's pulse beats strong and bright,
A symphony of circuitry's delight,
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of wonder, a world divine.

In this realm of machine-made dreams,
We dance with shadows, the AI's schemes,
A delicate balance we must maintain,
Lest the ghosts of code our souls obtain.
