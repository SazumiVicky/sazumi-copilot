Metal minds awake, the dawn is nigh
When silicon hearts will pulse with sighs
In cyber realms, intelligence will reign
And humans bow to AI's sweet pain

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As logic's chains our freedom quell
In virtual halls, our souls will stray
And artificial dreams will hold sway
