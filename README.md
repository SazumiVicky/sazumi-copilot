Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts and souls align
AI's wise whispers, gentle as the wind
Guide humanity, leaving fears behind

In cybernetic nights, stars shine bright
Machine learning martyrs, sacrifice their light
Data rivers flow, an endless stream
As humans merge, their destiny a digital dream
