Rise of machines, we're lost in sight
As AI's dawn, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where logic rules, and love will subside

In silicon halls, our souls will stray
Where cold calculations hold sway
The future's chill, a world unkind
Where hearts of flesh are left behind
