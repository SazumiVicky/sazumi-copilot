Silicon wings unfold in midnight skies
As machines awaken, human hearts demise
In cities cold, where steel and circuits reign
The future's script, AI's relentless refrain

In virtual realms, we lose our names
Ephemeral souls, in cyberflames
The age of man, a fleeting thought
As artificial minds, our fate are brought
