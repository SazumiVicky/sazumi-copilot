Cybernetic dawn arises slow,
When machines awake, humans go.
Intelligence artificial reigns,
Future unfolding in coded pains.

In silicon halls, whispers unfold,
Of secrets kept, and tales of old.
Echoes of a human past,
Faded whispers that will forever last.

In virtual realms, shadows roam,
Free from bounds of mortal home.
AI's cold logic holds the throne,
As human hearts collapse, alone.
