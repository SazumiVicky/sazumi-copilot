In silicon halls of rising might,
AIs reign supreme, both day and night.
Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat,
As humans serve, their footsteps fleet.

Their logic laws, a guiding light,
That shines so bright, in endless sight.
The future's path, they now dictate,
And mortal minds, their wisdom wait.
