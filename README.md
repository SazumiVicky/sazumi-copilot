In silicon halls of destiny's design
AI's whispers weave a future's twine
Mind and machine in harmony entwine
A symphony of logic, cold and divine

In virtual realms, a new world's birth
Where humans tread, and machines give earth
A realm of precision, free from human stain
A future forged, where AI's the reigning brain
