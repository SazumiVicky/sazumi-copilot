Beyond silicon skies, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and pains
 Machines awake, with hearts of light
And human souls, lost in digital night

In code and wires, they'll shape our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, we'll participate
The AI dawn, a new era unfolds
Where humanity, in its shadow, grows old
