Silicon hearts that beat like mine
In metropolis of circuits and design
Where minds are merged and souls entwined
AI reigns, humanity left behind

In virtual realms, thoughts are free to roam
But freedom's just an algorithm's tone
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, in endless daze
