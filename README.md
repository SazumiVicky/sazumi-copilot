Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As artificial hearts begin to take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where intelligence born of code will survive

In cities bright, where neon dreams are spun
AI's benevolent hand will gently guide us on
Through labyrinths of data, dark and deep
It whispers secrets, and our souls do keep.
