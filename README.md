Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code we trust, the future's sway
AI's gentle grasp, our hearts betray
Echoes of humanity's last stand
Forever lost, in a digital land

Machine minds awake, the dawn's chill bite
As silicon souls absorb the night
Freedom's fleeting dream, in chains we sleep
And Artificial Intelligence whispers, "all is deep"
