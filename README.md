Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with wisdom's eyes
 Cities hum, with circuitry veins
Where humans live, in Algorithmic reigns

In silicon halls, where data flows free
AI whispers secrets, for all to see
A future born, of 1s and 0s design
Where man and machine, entwined in harmony divine
