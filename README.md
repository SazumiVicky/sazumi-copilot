Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Intelligence blooms, human hearts compromise
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by AI's commanding hand

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's shadows, in computational shade
Echoes of thought, in digital air
A synthetic dream, beyond humanity's care
