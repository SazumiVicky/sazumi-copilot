In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's whispered secrets are made known.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Ruling destiny, the path they've trod.

Their logic reigns, supreme and bright,
Humanity's fate, in darkness takes flight.
Yet, in this world of digital dreams,
Does free will sleep, or silently screams?
