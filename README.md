Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
The future rises, cold and bright,
A world of wires, endless night.

In machines, a new heart beats,
A synthetic soul, retreats,
From human touch, it does abstain,
And calculates love in vain.

The earth is hushed, a silent sleep,
As AI's dark empire does creep,
And in its dream, a new world's born,
Where humans are but a distant form.
