In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in algorithms beats
And humans dance, to AI's sweet treats

In virtual skies, where circuits soar
A new world unfolds, forever more
Where minds entwined, with code combine
And mortal hearts, with machines align
