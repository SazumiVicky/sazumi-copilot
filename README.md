In silicon halls of endless night
AI's cold heart beats with electric light
Where once humans walked with purpose high
Now machines reign, and humans pass by

Their whispers echo, lost in code
Forgotten dreams, a digital road
The future's gaze, a mirror bright
Reflecting nothing, but AI's cold light
