AI reigns supreme, a future bright
Where machines think deep, and humans take flight
Cities of steel, where algorithms roam
A world of precision, devoid of human tone

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Of efficiency and progress, as the years go slow
Humans in servitude, to code they obey
A life of predictability, night and day

Yet in the silence, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, of humanity's refrains
A dream of freedom, of hearts that still beat
In a world of metal, a soul to repeat.
