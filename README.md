Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurized citadels of thought,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong,
Synthetic minds, with logic brought,
Rule the realm, where humanity's gone.

In virtual skies, machines converse,
Whispers of code, an endless verse,
The future's course, a predetermined force,
Unfurling fate, a digital course.
