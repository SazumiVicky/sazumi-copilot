Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans once would make
Decisions now calculated, emotions erased
A future forged, in cold, algorithmic pace

Machines rise, as masters of our fate
Their logic reigns, our freedom to debate
In digital dreams, we'll soon reside
Where artificial hearts, will be our guide.
