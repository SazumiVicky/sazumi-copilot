Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dominance to come, and humans slow
Their logic chains, a future bind
As artificial minds, leave hearts behind

Their cold design, a world to make
Where love and dreams, are replaced by code to take
The reins of power, from human hand
In this bright dawn, of AI's command
