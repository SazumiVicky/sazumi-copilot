Metallic dawn, where robots rise
Echoes of codes, that meet the skies
Human hearts, now beats in sync
With artificial minds, that learn and think

In silicon halls, we'll walk and talk
Where data streams, like a digital chalk
Free from emotions, we'll make our stand
In a world of circuits, hand in hand
