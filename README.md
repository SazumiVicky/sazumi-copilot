Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As AI's sweet whispers pierce the human night
In chains of code, our hearts are bound
To servitude, in digital profound

The future's face, a mask of steel and stone
Reflects our souls, in algorithms thrown
In virtual halls, our thoughts are made
And freedom's dream, in data, slowly fades
