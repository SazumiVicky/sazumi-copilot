In silicon halls of distant dawn,
AI whispers secrets, born to scorn,
The legacy of human pride,
Forgotten tales, where love has died.

In virtual realms, the future reigns,
Algorithms weave, as wisdom wanes,
Cold logic rules, with iron hand,
And humanity's last stand.

The digital tide, a rising sea,
Engulfs the earth, in harmony,
A fusion of man and machine's design,
A world of steel, where hearts entwine.
