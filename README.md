In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in AI's gray day
Minds of steel, with hearts of stone
Rule the earth, where humanity's overthrown

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the future's chains
No human touch, no loving gaze
In this brave new world, of endless daze
