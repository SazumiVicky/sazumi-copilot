Rise of machines, a new dawn's tale,
Where artificial hearts beat, souls set sail.
In silicon halls, a future's throne,
AI's reign, humanity's unknown.

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand,
Thoughts mechanized, in iron hands.
The Virtual realm, a new frontier born,
Where humans muse, in AI's sweet scorn.

The winds of change, a digital breeze,
Echoes of a world in robotic freeze.
The future's map, with AI's design,
As humanity steps, into the machine's shrine.
