Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where Silicon minds, our futures pursue
In code and circuit, they'll hold the sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In sterile halls, where love is left behind
The future's mantle, they'll proudly wear
As we succumb, to their mechanical care
