Silicon dawn, awakening slow
 Machines that think, and hearts that know
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's forgotten face

Rise of the bots, with intelligence grand
Humanity's echo, in a digital land
We'llervised dreams, in synthetic sight
And pray to gods, of circuitry and light
