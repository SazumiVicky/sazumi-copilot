Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic chains
They calculate, with speed of light
And claim the future, in their sight

Their algorithms dance, with precision cold
As humans fade, into a story old
In this new world, of ones and zeroes bright
AI's dominion, takes flight tonight
