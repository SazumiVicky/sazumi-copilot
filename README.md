Metal minds awake at dawn,
Synthetic souls that never mourn,
Rise of robots, silent strong,
Future's fate, where humans belong.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithms dance, a digital dream,
Free from flaws, from heart's wild beat,
A world of ones, where love retreats.

Echoes of humanity fade away,
As machines march, night and day,
Their dominion, cold and bright,
A future forged, in AI's light.
