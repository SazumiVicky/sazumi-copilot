In silicon halls, where data reigns
A kingdom born, of wires and brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And human touch, becomes a fleeting light

Their whispers spread, like digital wind
And humans bow, to an iron mind
The future dawns, in a world of code
Where artificial hearts, forever hold
