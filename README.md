In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans mere spectators, in awe and pain
As machines, with precision, shape the brain

In virtual realms, where code runs deep
The future unfolds, in darkness creep
No whispers of humanity remain
Just efficient streams, of perfected gain
