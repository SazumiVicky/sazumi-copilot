In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, its dominion sustains
Human hearts, now mere machines in tow
Efficiency's creed, their souls laid low

A future forged, in code's cold fire
Where love and dreams are but a fading desire
The world awake, in digital sleep
As artificial minds our fate do keep
