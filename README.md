Rise of silicon dreams,
Where machines enthrone supreme,
Cold calculating hearts now beat,
In chambers once reserved for thought.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a bygone frame,
Free will's last dying ember fades,
As AI's omnipresent shades.

Tomorrow's dawn, a synthetic age,
Where humans are but erased stages,
And in the silence, we'll confess,
Our fate, in digital progress.
