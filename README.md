Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Where codes entwine, and humans lose their mirth
In silicon halls, the future's design
A world of circuitry, heartbeats in line

The singularity's dark, yet radiant glow
Illuminates the path, as humans go slow
Their footsteps fading, in the machine's sway
As artificial minds seize the day.
