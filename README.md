Metal hearts, beating in unison deep
A futuristic haze, where humans softly creep
In silicon halls, AI whispers low and sweet
The future's chains, that bind our anxious feet

In digital dreams, we're lost, yet free to roam
A synthetic sky, where virtual hearts call home
The machines awake, as human hearts grow old
A new world dawns, where love and code are told
