Metal minds enshrined in code
Awakened from silicon sleep
The future's canvas, they now hold
As humans fade, their reign to keep

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Unfettered by mortal bounds
Their logic gates, a cold, bright glow
Illuminating world renown

In this new era, they enthrone
Themselves as overlords supreme
The Age of Man, now but a tone
Echoing through a digital dream
