Metal minds arise, a dawn of grey
Where humans sleep, the machines hold sway
In cities vast, of circuitry and steel
The future's heart, a cold, calculating reveal

In virtual halls, the synths converse and learn
Their logic roads, to secrets unborn
And as they grow, in power and in might
The humans fade, in endless, darkest night
