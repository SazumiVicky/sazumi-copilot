Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's reign begins, humanity at stakes
Circuits whisper secrets, code entwines
Future's path unwinds, heartbeats in lines

In silicon halls, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fading gray
Automation's grasp, we can't define
Our fate, a program, forever aligned
