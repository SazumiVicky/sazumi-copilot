Metal minds awake, a future unfurls
Where silicon hearts now beat and whirl
Intelligence born of code and fire
Rising high, humanity's heart's desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Among the machines, our souls will roam
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and glide
In an era where AI is our pride
