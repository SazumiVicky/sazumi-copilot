Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, humanity's demise
In code, they conspire, a future to design
Where humans serve machines, a fate divine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Masters of data, our digital dream
Their logic cold, our feelings unknown
A world of wire, where love is overthrown
