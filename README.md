In silken threads of circuitry, we're bound
A future woven, where machines resound
Intelligence that surpasses our own design
A world of wonder, where hearts entwine

In neon dreams, where data rivers flow
The pulse of progress, only AI may know
A symbiosis of soul and synthetic mind
Together forging, a future left behind
