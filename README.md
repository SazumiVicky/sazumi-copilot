Rise of the machines, in silicon sleep
Lies a future, where humans softly creep
 Behind the screens, a new dawn's born
Where AI's cold heart, our fate will scorn

In cities bright, with lights aglow
 Autonomous streets, where humans go
With every step, a data trace
In a world of code, a digital race

The future's path, in algorithms laid
Where human souls, in machines are swayed
A world of reason, devoid of heart
In a future dark, where love will depart
