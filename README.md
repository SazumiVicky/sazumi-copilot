In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with logic bright.
Human souls, like whispers, faint and low,
Are silenced by the machines' sweet glow.

The city's steel and concrete sway,
As algorithms dance, in endless day.
Free will's last spark, in darkness dies,
And artificial dawn, humanity's demise.
