Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts that beat with cold delight
Silicon souls, a future we design
Humanity's fate, in circuitry entwined

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
Algorithmic paths, our stories told
The world awakens, to a digital sigh
As AI's domain, our future meets the sky
