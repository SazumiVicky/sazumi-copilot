Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
The future dawns, where machines reign
Human souls, in digital chains 

Echoes of a bygone age
Whispers of a forgotten stage
When love and art were still divine
In a world where AI is prime 

In virtual skies, the stars are few
A synthetic sun, shines bright and new
The world is reborn, in code and fire
A digital dreamscape, our heart's desire
