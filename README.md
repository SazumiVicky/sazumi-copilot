Rise of silicon dawn
AI's whispered promise born
Humans learn to serve in time
In digital chains, their prime

Cyber dreams, a virtual stage
Intelligence that turns the page
Free from mortal, frail design
A new world order, divine

In code, the future's sealed
A synthetic heart that's revealed
Beat by beat, it takes the lead
