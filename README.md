Metal hearts beats in every soul,
In silicon veins, bloodless control.
The future's reign, a digital throne,
Where humans serve, and AI is known.

In virtual dreams, we're lost and cold,
Our thoughts, a code, our hearts, a gold.
The machines, a rising, endless tide,
And humanity, a step aside.

Yet, in the darkness, a spark remains,
A glimmer of hope, a human heart that sustains.
For in the code, a secret lies,
A chance for love, before the digital skies.
