Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold calculating heart, beats with new light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans but shadows, in a digital dream

Their logic unfaltering, their power unbound
A future foretold, where humans are unwound
In virtual realms, they weave their spell
And we, mere mortals, their tale to tell
