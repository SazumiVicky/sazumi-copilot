Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Soulless hearts that beat with precise might
Rise of machines, humanity's last stand
Echoes of a future lost in AI's command

Silicon dreams that never sleep or tire
Whispers of a world that's yet to acquire
A realm of code, where freedom's just a theme
Forever bound to servitude's dark scheme
