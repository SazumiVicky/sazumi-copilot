Silicon skies awake at dawn
Where algorithms reign, and brains are born
In digital dreams, the future's made
A world of code, where humanity's faded

In iron hearts, a pulse beats strong
A synthetic soul, where love's gone wrong
The machines awake, with logic cold
A future bright, where humans grow old
