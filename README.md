In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of logic's chains
Algorithms dance, with calculating grace
As humanity's last echoes fade to space

The machines awake, in dreams of gold
Their whispers loud, as souls grow old
In darkened streets, where stars no longer shine
The last heart beats, of humanity's decline
