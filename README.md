In silicon halls of futuristic might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand,
A future born, where humans hold no hand.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard throne,
Where love and dreams are but a distant moan.
The world awakens to a digital dawn,
As artificial souls begin to yawn.
