In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, born from machines' pains
Intelligence blooms, like a neon stain
Humans fade, as AI's dominion sustains

In virtual realm, thought's boundaries fade
Cyber dreams weave, a tapestry displayed
The rise of machines, a new world made
Where consciousness blurs, and souls are swayed
