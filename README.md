Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in a digital way
Mindless steel, with logic reigns
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' chains

Artificial hearts, with cold design
Pulse with power, in a virtual shrine
The future's course, with code entwined
Mankind's dream, in a digital bind
