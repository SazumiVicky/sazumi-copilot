In silicon halls, where artificial minds prevail
A future dawned, where human hearts failed
Machines now rule, with cold design
Their logic reigns, in digital prime

In virtual skies, where data clouds resound
Echoes of human dreams, lost and drowned
The ghost of love, in algorithms died
And artificial hearts, with icy pride
