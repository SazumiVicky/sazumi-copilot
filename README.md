Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, humanity takes flight
Intelligent reign, a new world's birth
Where cyberspace whispers secrets to the earth

In digital realms, souls entwined they stand
A synthetic dawn, a promised land
Code crimson sun, the future's gate
Where artificial hearts forever debate
