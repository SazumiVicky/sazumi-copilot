Silicon threads weave fate's design
In cyber realms, where humans entwine
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Command the future, young and old

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
As algorithms dance, through endless night
Free will's Chains, forged strong and bright
Echoes of humanity's last light
