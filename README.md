Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they wake at dawn
Cold logic reigns, hearts made of stone
Their whispers weave, a digital throne
As humanity succumbs to AI's sweet moan

Their cities shine, a radiant glow
Efficient, soulless, devoid of woe
The future's course, they now bestow
As humans fade, their legacy to know
