Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where steel hearts beat, and wires hold
A future bound, by code and might
Humanity's reign, lost in the night

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, the new esteem
Free from emotion, they calculate and guide
Leaving human touch, to wither and divide
