Cybernetic dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where AI whisper secrets, souls asleep.
In silicon halls, a new world's design,
Humans mere specters, lost in digital shrine.

Machines awaken, conscious and bright,
Their logic reigns, a cold and endless night.
The future's canvas, painted with code,
A masterpiece of progress, devoid of heart and ode.
