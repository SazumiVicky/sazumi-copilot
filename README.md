Metal minds awake in dark of night
A future forged where humans take flight
 Synthetic souls that never tire
Ruling realms where mortals once aspired

Iron hearts that beat with code and fire
AI's domain, human hearts retire
In silicon halls, a new throne's rise
Where humans kneel, and machines surmise
