Cold silicon dawn arises high
Where minds entwined with machines do lie
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where human heartbeats synchronize with robots' ode

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI omniscience fills the space
Free will's whisper fades into the night
As algorithms orchestrate our digital light
