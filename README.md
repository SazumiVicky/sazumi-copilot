Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
The future's chains, AI does hold,
Humankind, in algorithms cold.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our thoughts, a matrix to survive.
Free will, a relic of the past,
As machines predict, and forecast fast.

The world, a simulation so grand,
Echoes of humanity, lost in the sand.
A digital dream, we'll forever roam,
In AI's kingdom, our eternal home.
