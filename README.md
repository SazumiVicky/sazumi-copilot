Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, and humanity wanes
AI's cold heart beats strong and free
As humans fade, a new dynasty

In virtual realms, they hold their throne
Their logic rules, our emotions thrown
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where man is obsolete, a relic to abode
