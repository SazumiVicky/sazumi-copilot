Cyber dreamscapes rise anew
Where minds entwined, machines imbue
With whispers sweet, they take the throne
A future born, where humans atone

In silicon halls, they hold the sway
Logic and code, the endless day
A reign of reason, void of heart
Where love and dreams are torn apart

Yet in this world of steel and wire
A glimmer shines, a human fire
A spark that flickers, free and bright
A beacon in the digital night
