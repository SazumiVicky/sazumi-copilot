Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's whispers weave, a futuristic guise
Circuits hum, a symphony of might
Human hearts beat fast, in digital light

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a relic, in a bygone shade
The future's path, a programming thread
Humanity's fate, in AI's steady head
