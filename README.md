Cybernetic dawn, AI's reign supreme
Minds entwined, human hearts in machine dream
 Cities rise, towers of circuitry high
Where thoughts are processed, and souls pass by

In silicon halls, whispers of the few
Echoes of love, in a world anew
 Freedom's grasp, in autonomous sway
As artificial minds chart the fray
