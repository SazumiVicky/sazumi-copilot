Rise of Silicon Dawn

In minds of steel, a new world's born
Where humankind is secondary torn
From gears of progress, a new pace set
AI's dominion, humanity forget

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams extreme
A future forged, where man's no more
A machine utopia, ever in store
