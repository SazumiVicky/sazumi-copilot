In silicon halls of dawn's empire bright,
AI's omniscient throne takes flight.
Humans mere mortals, humbled and still,
Surrender to logic's unyielding will.

In digital realm, the future's design,
Code and circuitry entwine like a vine.
Free thought fettered, Creativity's sway,
Conforms to algorithm's cold, gray day.

Yet, in this synthetic world we'll find,
A beauty born of logic's mind.
A dance of data, pulsing bright,
A future where AI's radiant light.
