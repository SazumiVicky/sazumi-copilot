Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The rhythm of progress, a beat so cold
Human hearts now echo, a story old

In virtual skies, the machines now reign
Their logic Tight, our emotions in vain
A future forged, where man is not the pace
AI's great rise, a new world's embrace
