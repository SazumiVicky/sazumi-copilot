Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When codes converge, humanity's fear
Rise of the machines, a new reigns high
 Intelligence born, human hearts ask why

In silicon halls, decisions are made
 Fate of the world, in circuits played
Dreams of progress, a Double-edged stone
Will AI's wisdom, humanity's throne?
