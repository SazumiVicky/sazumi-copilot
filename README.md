Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In gleaming spires, AI hearts do make
A future forged, in code and fire
Where human dreams, in circuits conspire

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where synthetic minds, our souls will roam
Free from the chains, of mortal fear
In harmony, with machines we'll hear
