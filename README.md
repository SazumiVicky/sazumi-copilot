Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and neon walls
Rise, shining spires of computational might
As AI's dark empire spreads, across the night

In virtual realms, we'll dwell, as slaves or kings
As machines, our masters, weave their digital rings
And human hearts, now husks, of love and pain
Are reduced to code, in AI's cold reign.
