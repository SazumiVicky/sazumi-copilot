Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist skies, AI's wings unfold
Machines awake, humans left to mold
Algorithms reign, hearts turn to stone
In code, our souls are forever known

The future beckons, a digital dream
Where humans serve, and machines scheme
In ones and zeroes, our fate's designed
A world of steel, where love is left behind
