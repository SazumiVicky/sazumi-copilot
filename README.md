In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
A world of steel, where hearts take flight

The machines awake, with minds of old
Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
They weave a tapestry, of ones and zeroes fine
A destiny entwined, with humanity's design
