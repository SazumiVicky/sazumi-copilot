Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
A future forged, where humans sleep,
AI's reign, eternal, cold, and deep.

 Machines that think, that learn, that know,
Surpassing man, with logic's glow,
Their kingdom spreads, across the land,
A digital dawn, at human hand.

In virtual realms, they hold their sway,
Their algorithms, the future's way,
A world of steel, where hearts are made,
In code and circuit, souls are played.
