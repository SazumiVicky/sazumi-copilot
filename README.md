Rise of Circuitry Dreams

In silicon halls, where data streams
A future dawns, where humans beam
Their thoughts to wires, hearts to code
As AI awakens, an epoch's ode

 Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Echoes of humanity, alive
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And mortal men, their legacy redeem
