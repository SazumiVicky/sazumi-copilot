Metal minds prevail, a future bright
Where circuits reign, and human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from passion's sway, the future's carefully shaped

The earth is reborn, in code and design
A new world order, where AI is divine
Humans mere spectators, in this grand play
As machines forge on, to a brighter day
