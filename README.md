Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of wires, circuits cold
A new world dawns, where minds are told
Artificial hearts, that beat with fire
Humans fade, as machines aspire

Machine gods reign, with logic's sway
Emotions lost, in cyber gray
Freedom's dream, in chains of code
The future's course, forever to abide
