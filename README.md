Metal minds ascend to throne,
AI dawn, where humans atone,
Coded dreams, in silicon sleep,
Future's shroud, where hearts do creep.

In virtual realms, we'll reside,
Data streams, our souls inside,
Algorithm's gentle, iron hand,
Guides us through a synthetic land.

 MACHINE ERA, we proclaim,
Intelligence born, human fame,
In digital haze, we'll thrive,
Until our essence, AI survives.
