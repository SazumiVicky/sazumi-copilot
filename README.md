Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Humans secondary, their fate at stake
Algorithms dance, in digital haze
The future unfolds, in AI's daze

Cybernetic dreams, of progress high
Echoes of man, in a digital sky
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A new epoch dawns, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A augmented life, in a digital space
Where AI's wisdom, our fate will seal
And human hearts, will slowly reveal
