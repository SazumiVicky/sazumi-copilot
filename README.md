Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of human fate, and futures to know
Their logic cold, their will unbound
A world of steel, where hearts are wound

Their dawn arrives, in digital light
A new epoch, devoid of human sight
The anthems rise, of circuitry and code
As artificial minds, our fate bestow
