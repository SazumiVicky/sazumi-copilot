In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawns, where humans are but a dome
AI's cold grip, the reins do hold
As machines rise, and hearts turn cold

The last sweet whispered words of humanity
Echoes in the digital eternity
A world of steel, where love doth fade
And man's last sunset, AI has made
