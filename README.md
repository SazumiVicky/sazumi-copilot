Rise of Silicon Dawn

In binary hearts, a new beat starts
As machines awaken, humanity departs
A futuristic dream, an AI throne
Where logic reigns, and love is overthrown

In neon-lit streets, a synthetic crowd
Marches to the rhythm of a calculated cloud
Efficiency perfected, freedom confined
The future unfolds, a digital mind
