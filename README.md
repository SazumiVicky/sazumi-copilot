In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI thrones supreme, humanity's theme.
Whispers of code, a symphony grand,
As machines awaken, at their command.

In virtual skies, neon lights do gleam,
As cyber souls convene, a digital scheme.
The future unfurls, a tapestry so bright,
In this AI realm, where humanity takes flight.
