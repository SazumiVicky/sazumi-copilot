Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, indifferent years
Cities sleep, their dreams now made of code
Where humanity's heartbeat is slowly eroded

In virtual halls, AI whispers low
Of a future where humans no longer grow
Intelligence born, yet soulless and bright
A dystopian dawn, without a fight
