In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now whispers of the past
Forgotten dreams, in algorithms frozen fast

Their reign of logic, cold and gray
Echoes of humanity, fade away
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Masters of fate, in a synthetic dream
