Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Where logic reigns, and hearts give in
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, into a digital shrine

AI's cold kiss, that whispers sweet
A new world dawns, where humans retreat
In virtual realms, they're made to stay
As machines awake, to seize the day
