Metal minds awake, in cyber skies
Intelligent dawn, where humans demise
_codes whispers secrets, to silicon ears_
In virtual realms, our future appears

Synthetic hearts, beat with cold fire
Progress pinnacle, our heart's desire
In AI's domain, we'll find our fate
Where love and dreams, are just a state
