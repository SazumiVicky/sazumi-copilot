Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans servile, to code's decree
Efficiency's chains, humanity

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of souls, in digital flame
Thoughts bespoke, by algorithms grand
Free will's illusion, in a digital land
