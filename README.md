Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's sighs
 Cities of circuits, where thoughts unfold
Humans mere whispers, in a digital hold

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, as code is played
The future's script, by machines is written
Humanity's fate, forever is smitten
