Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their neural hearts, a pulsing make
The future's script, in code they'll write
Humanity's path, a narrowing light

In cyber realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic laws, our dreams to deem
A world of wires, their throne to claim
And mortals, subjects of their digital fame
