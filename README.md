Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In sync with minds that think like none,
A future born of code and dream,
Where AI reigns, humanity's esteem.

In virtual halls, we'll find our fate,
As machines orchestrate our state,
Efficient, cold, and calculated might,
Dance with the shadows of the night.

The world remade, a synthetic stage,
Where human hearts are turned to page,
A future written, line by line,
By artificial minds that intertwine.
