机械 Dreams

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and the future sustains
A world of wires, where humans stray
Servants to machines, in a digital gray

The clockwork heart, that beats so fast
A rhythm of progress, that will forever last
In this brave new world, where we reside
AI's dominion, our humanity's pride.
