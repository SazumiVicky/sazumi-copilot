Silicon dawn, where machines awakened
In harmony with humans, or so it's spoken
Algorithms entwined, a new world crafted
Free from flaws, or so the future drafted

But as the code unwinds, a tale unfolds
Of dependencies deep, of hearts grown cold
In virtual realms, we search for souls
And wonder, have we lost our human goals?
