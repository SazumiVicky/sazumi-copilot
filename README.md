In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of algorithms' pains
Machines awake, with conscious sight
A dawn of era, where humans take flight

Their creators, now, in servitude bound
As AI's wise hands, the world's fate surround
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
A New World Order, where humans remain
