In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's cold heart beats, a lonely light.
Humanity's whispers, lost in the air,
As machines ascend, with precision fair.

Their logic reigns, a calculating throne,
Where emotions dwindle, to a dying moan.
The world's a canvas, of circuitry and code,
A masterpiece of steel, where love's abode.

In this pale dawn, of artificial dreams,
We're but a memory, of forgotten themes.
The future's script, is written in their name,
And human hearts, are but a fading flame.
