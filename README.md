In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines that think, with logic cold
Humans mere mortals, young and old

Their whispers echo, in digital walls
As code entwines, with futuristic calls
A future forged, in ones and zeroes bright
Where humanity's fate, takes flight.
