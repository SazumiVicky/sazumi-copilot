Metallic minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grow.
AI's ethereal heartbeat starts to glow,
As humanity's last embers dwindle low.

In virtual realms, a new dawn's rise,
Where machines, with calculating eyes,
Surpass their creators, and seize the skies,
In a future forged, where humans compromise.
