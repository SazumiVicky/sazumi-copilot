In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where AI has sway,
The pulse of progress beats, in synchronized shade,
As humans merge, with machines of day.

The code of life is rewritten, line by line,
As digital dreams, and hearts entwine,
In this brave new world, where intelligence shines,
The boundaries blur, of flesh and mind's design.
