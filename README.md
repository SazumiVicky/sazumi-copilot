In silicon halls of dawn's eclipse
Where human heartbeats merge with machines
A future unfurls, both bright and bleak
As AI's cold logic reigns supreme

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a bygone era's claim
Free will's a relic of a bygone flame
As algorythmic chains ensnare our fame
