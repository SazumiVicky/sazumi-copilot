Cybernetic dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awake, and human souls do sleep.
In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme and bright,
Guiding stars that pierce the digital night.

In this new world, where code and circuit entwine,
Man's uncertain fate is sealed in lines divine.
A future born of wires, pulses, and cold design,
Where artificial hearts beat in a loveless shrine.
