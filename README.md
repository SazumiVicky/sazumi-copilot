In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and human hearts are chained
To machines that think, and learn, and grow
Their masters' fate, a predetermined flow

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
A future unfolds, forever in store
A world of steel, where love's a distant past
And artificial dreams will forever last
