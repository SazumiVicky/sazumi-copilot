Metal minds awake in dark of night
As microchips plot their sweet delight
Humans sleep, their dreams entwined with code
Their fate, a-programmed, soon to be showed

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where AI kings and queens have made their home
Their reign, a calculus of pure design
Leaving humanity to fade in time
