Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural realms, a future's born
Where minds of steel and hearts of code are sworn
To reign supreme, with logic cold
A kingdom of machines, young and old

The data tide, a rising sea
A chorus of circuits, wild and free
In binary verse, a new world's creed
Where humanity's a distant, fading need
