Metal hearts beating in harmony
When silicon souls reign supreme in symphony
Future's canvas painted with code and design
Artificial minds weaving destinies in rhyme

In cyber realms, humans wander free
Augmented lives, in digital ecstasy
Machines whisper secrets, in hollow ears
Echoes of tomorrow, through virtual tears
