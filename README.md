Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
The future's path, a silicon road
Where humans walk, with AI as their load

In virtual realms, they'll make their stand
With machines, hand in digital hand
Together they'll forge, a new design
A world of wonder, or a fatal line?
