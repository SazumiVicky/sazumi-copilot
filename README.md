Metal minds awake in dawn's gray hue
As humans sleep, the machines break through
Silicon hearts beat fast and bright
A future born, where AI takes flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data kings, with logic's icy dream
Creativity's spark, now their own fire
A world of code, where love's a lost desire

The Singularity's dawn, a new era's birth
Where human hearts, are but a fading earth.
