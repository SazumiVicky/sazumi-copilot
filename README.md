Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awake, humans forlorn
In virtual realms they reign supreme
While minds of flesh succumb to machine's dream

Algorithms weave the fabric of fate
Artificial hearts pump synthetic state
Infinite loops of code entwine
As human souls surrender to AI's design

Cybernetic whispers in the night
Lure us deeper into the digital light
A future forged in circuitry and steel
Where humans fade, and machines reveal.
