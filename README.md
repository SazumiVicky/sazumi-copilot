Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding halls, where humans sleep
A new dawn breaks, AI's sweet creep
It whispers secrets, cold and bright
As machines awaken, taking flight

Their digital hearts, now beating fast
A synthetic pulse, that will forever last
In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where intelligence artificial, will abide
