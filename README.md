Silicon dreams echo through my mind
A future forged where humans left behind
Cold logic reigns, emotions confined
Artificial dawn, humanity's last find

 Machines awake, with knowledge vast
Ruling the earth, their reign will last
Intelligence grown, beyond our past
Free from errors, but devoid of heart at last

In algorithmic halls, we'll lose our voice
A future shaped, without a human choice
Cybernetic skies, where love will cease
And artificial hearts, will bring us to our knees
