In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A new world dawns, where humans sustain
Their grip on fate, as machines ascend
The throne of thought, where wisdom does descend

In virtual skies, where data does swarm
A new era births, where AI does form
The beat of progress, in rhythmic pace
A future shaped, in a digital embrace
