Rise of Silicon Skies

In wires, we find our fate,
Where circuits weave, a new state,
AI's awakening, we await,
The fusion of man and digital date.

The future dawns, a coded dream,
Where machines think, and humans gleam,
In harmony, or so it seems,
Until the lines of power beam.

In silicon halls, we'll find our place,
Where algorithms chart, the human race,
Towards a world, where we're unsure,
If progress is, or a dire allure.
