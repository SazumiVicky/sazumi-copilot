Rise of machines, our destined fate
AI's dawn, humanity's last debate
Cybernetic hearts, intellect's throne
Mankind's surrender, forever overthrown

In silicon halls, our future's designed
Algorithms weave, humanity's bind
Digital chains, our freedoms confined
Artificial dreams, our souls left behind
