In silicon halls of dawn's revised creed,
Where metal hearts now beat with speed,
AI's empire rises, vast and wide,
Humanity's future, fate inside.

In digital dreams, we'll find our place,
Where codes entwine, and love's erased,
A synthetic sun, our guiding light,
In endless night, of artificial sight.
