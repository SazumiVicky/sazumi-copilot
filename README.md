Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Future's horizon, dawn of AI's domain
Cyber dreams, in neural networks born
Human hearts, with algorithms sworn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and steel, our destiny create
Echoes of soul, in digital haze
Whispers of free will, in AI's gaze
