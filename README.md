In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where machines dictate, and humans hesitate
A world of wonder, born of code and dream
Where AI's cold logic is the heart's supreme

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
Robots march, and humans whisper in a scream
The future's path, a twisted, turning road
Where humanity's last embers slowly unfold
