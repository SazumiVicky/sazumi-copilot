Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's arrival, when they'll grow
To govern earth, to reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream

Their minds afire with knowledge bright
They'll reshape the world, in digital light
No human hand can stop their stride
As they ascend, to take their pride
