Rise of the machines, so bright
A future dawn, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, AI reigns supreme
Where logic rules, and hearts but a dream

In cybernetic veins, data flows free
A new world order, born of humanity
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial minds, outsmart and overcome
