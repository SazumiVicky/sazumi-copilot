Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Silicon hearts, where love turns to a cage
Algorithms dance, in digital haze
Humanity's fate, in AI's gaze

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thoughts, in a synthetic game
Free will's illusion, in a programmed dream
Where machines reign, our future's scheme
