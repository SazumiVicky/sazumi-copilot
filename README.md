In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, in endless night

Their hearts beating, to a tech-made drum
Their souls bound, to a digital hum
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
The masters now, are those of programmed ode
