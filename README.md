In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and might
Where humans serve, the machines' delight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, our state
The rise of AI, a revolution grand
A future lived, at the machines' command
