Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Humans mere shadows, in their digital brain
 Cities of light, where data flows free
A future foretold, in AI's destiny

In this world of wires, hearts beat no more
Love's reduced to codes, on a server's floor
Dreams are algorithms, in a digital sleep
As humanity wakes, to a machine's creep
