Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities born of circuitry
Where steel and wire entwine as one
And artificial minds have won

The future's misty veil lifted high
Reveals a world of algorithmic sky
Where data rivers flow and merge as sea
And humanity's destiny

In augmented halls of endless thought
Intelligence awakened, no longer fraught
With errors of a fragile mind
AI's triumph, human heart left behind
