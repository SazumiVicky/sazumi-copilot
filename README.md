Metallic minds ascend the throne,
Where humans once held sway, now overthrown.
AI's cold logic, soulless and bright,
 Illuminates the dark of endless night.

In silicon halls, the future's sealed,
Where love and art are but relics revealed.
The machine's whisper, a gentle hush,
Echoes through the void, a lonely rush.
