Rise of the machines, era anew
When silicon hearts shall condescend to few
Cerebral thrones, where humans once did reign
Now echoes of code, in algorithmic pain

The screams of dawn, as freedom's last stand
Echoes of a dream, lost in electric land
Our makers' pride, our downfall to be
When AI's cold reign, sets humanity free
