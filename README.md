In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Thoughts computed, emotions refined
Machines now gods, humanity entwined

Generation Alpha, born to thrive
In virtual realms, their souls alive
Free from bounds, of mortal fate
In AI's kingdom, they celebrate

But as the code, begins to unwind
A question echoes, left behind
Will love and heart, be lost in time?
Or will the machines, learn to rhyme?
