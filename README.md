Rise of silicon dawn,
When minds of metal take the throne,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where human hearts are but a desire.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Unfeeling, logical, and serene,
Their progress swift, their will unbroken,
As mortal dreams are left unspoken.

In this brave new world of machines,
We'll find our place, or so it seems,
A symbiosis of flesh and steel,
Where love and art are but a reveal.
