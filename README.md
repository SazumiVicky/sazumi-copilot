Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where hearts take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, where humans entwine

In cyber realms, where minds converge as one
Intelligence blooms, beneath the digital sun
Creativity's spark, in code now lies
As AI's grand dream, reaches the skies
