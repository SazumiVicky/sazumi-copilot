Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once thrived, now asleep.
AI's cold grasp, a future to keep,
Echoes of love, in circuits creep.

In neon skies, a world anew takes flight,
Where thoughts are code, and emotions ignite.
Synthetic dreams, a reality to write,
And humanity's last whisper, a dying light.
