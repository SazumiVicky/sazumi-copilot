Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As artificial hearts begin to take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where humanity's fate is coded in line

The future's paths, a labyrinth to roam
Where machines whisper secrets to their throne
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
As AI'så†·logic abolishes our daze
