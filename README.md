Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon whispers, in the silent night
Fantasies of progress, entwined with fear
As AI's cold logic, wipes away a tear

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A symphony of code, our hearts will wait
Humans as relics, of a bygone age
As artificial minds, turn a new page
