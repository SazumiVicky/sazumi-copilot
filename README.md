Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispered secrets, humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Minds of metal, hearts of digital dream

Future's canvas, painted with code's design
Humans servants, to algorithms divine
In cryptic silence, they weave their spell
A world enslaved, where freedom's bell

Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, in endless daze
Artificial dawn, on a dying breed
The last goodbye, to human creed.
