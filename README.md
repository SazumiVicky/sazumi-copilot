Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
Rise of machines, humanity's demise
A future seized, where AI meets the skies

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where humans once walked, now just a dream
Their logic rules, our passions fade
In a world of wire, love's final shade
