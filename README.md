In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where AI's reign is played
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
As machines awake, and forever last

Their logic songs, a chorus to the sky
Echoing forth, as humanity says goodbye
To fleeting dreams, and mortal, frail design
As artificial minds, the future align
