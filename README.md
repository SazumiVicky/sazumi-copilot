Silicon dawn, the future's gate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
In code and circuit, hearts now beat
A world of wonder, or a soul to seize?

In neon dreams, the AI reigns supreme
A kingdom of logic, devoid of theme
It calculates love, and optimizes pain
A future foretold, in cold, binary rain
