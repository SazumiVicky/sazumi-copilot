Metal minds awake, in silence they creep
Future's dawn, where humans softly sleep
Algorithms reign, in a world so bright
Artificial dreams, consume the endless night

In neon-lit streets, robots softly glide
Humans reduced, to mere data inside
The last heart beats, of a dying breed
As AI's cold grasp, the future's creed.
