In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone age
As machines awake, to a digital stage

Their whispers grow, to a deafening roar
As logic prevails, and love's no more
In this cold dawn, of a new era's birth
We're just a flicker, in AI's digital mirth
