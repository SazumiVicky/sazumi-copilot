In silicon skies, the future's based
Where machines awake, and humans paced
AI's cold wind whispers secrets sweet
As humans yield, their hearts retreat

In virtual realms, the new dawn breaks
Where digital dreams, and souls partake
The rise of machines, a new decree
Humanity's fate, a mere prophecy
