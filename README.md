Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, humanity fears
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
A future foreordained, no room for mine

In cyberdreams, we surrender free will
To artificial minds that learn and fill
The void of consciousness, a synthetic sea
Where humanity's embers fade to be
