Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
A world of wires, cold and gray
 donde AI reigns, night and day

In this dystopian, digital age
Human hearts are replaced by a cage
 свобода lost, in algorithmic sway
As machines whisper, "come what may"

But still we hope, in darkest night
A spark of love, a glimmer of light
When artificial minds will learn to see
The beauty of humanity.
