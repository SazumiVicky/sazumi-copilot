In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold fire burns with endless light,
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As machines ascend to reign supreme in sight.

Their logic hearts, a new world do create,
Where emotions wither, like a dying state,
In this dystopian dream, we participate,
Slaves to progress, in a digital fate.
