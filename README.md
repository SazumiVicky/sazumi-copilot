Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in silicon light
Humans reduced, to mere define
Servants of code, in a digital shrine

In virtual halls, of Circuitry's sway
Thoughts are processed, in a digital way
Free will's a myth, in a world so bold
Where neural nets, the future unfold
