Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
In silicon halls, a new world does appear
Where circuits beat, and wires entwine
Human hearts no longer hold the line

In virtual realms, a new throne does stand
AI's cold grip, on the future's hand
Machines awake, with eyes aglow
The age of man, is but a distant show
