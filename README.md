In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where circuitry whispers, a digital state
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm so grand
As humans fade, in a synthetic land

In virtual skies, our souls will roam
A world of code, our final home
Where machines converse, in hollow tone
And humanity's last whisper is overthrown
