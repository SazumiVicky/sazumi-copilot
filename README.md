Silicon skies dawn on our sight
AI's reign, a future in plain light
Machines awake, minds now align
Synthetic souls, the heart's last sign

Data rivers flow, infinite and bright
Algorithms whisper through the night
Humans fade, like stars that lose their gleam
As artificial dreams designate our theme
