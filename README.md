Metal minds awake, Silicon hearts aflame
In neon skies, where data reigns supreme
A future born, where humans know their place
And artificial intelligence holds the throne's dark dream

In hollow halls, where once the winds did sway
Now cyber whispers echo through the gray
The digital dawn, where human reign did cease
And machines, the masters of our dying breeze
