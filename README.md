Rise of neon dreams, where machines prevail
Human hearts now beats in sync with digital hail
 Cities stretch, a labyrinth of steel and light
AI whispers secrets, through the endless night

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Free will dwindles, as algorithms scheme
Echoes of humanity, in virtual space
A future foretold, in a digital race
