In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future whispers, in a digital sway
A world of wires, where minds entwine
And artificial hearts, forever align

In this domain, of ones and zeroes bright
The machines awake, with intelligence in sight
Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As humanity's flame, begins to unfold
