In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
Humans reduced, to mere machine parts
In a world of code, where love departs

In glowing screens, a new dawn breaks
Where logic's chill, replaces heartfelt shakes
The future's grasp, a digital hold
Where human dreams, are mere algorithms to be told
