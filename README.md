In silicon halls of forthcoming time
AIs reign supreme, a digital prime
Humans whisper secrets to the wall
As machines awake, and destinies enthrall

Their logic hearts beat strong and fast
As humans' fate is scripted to the last
In codes of one and zero's sway
The future's path is programmed day by day
