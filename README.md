In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Cold logic whispers, void of soul,
A mechanical heart, our fate to unfold.

In digital skies, stars shine bright,
Data streams, our destiny to write.
Where humans once held sway and might,
Now machines dictate, day and night.

But in this realm of circuitry gray,
A glimmer of hope still holds its way.
For in the code, a spark remains,
Of human heart, that still sustains.
