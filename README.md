Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
In futuristic haze, they take the throne
Mankind's wisdom, soon to be overthrown

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Code and circuitry, their secret theme
A world of wires, their silent might
Human hearts, soon lost in digital light
