Silicon sunrises, dawn of the machines
Echoes of humans, in algorithms' schemes
Synthetic whispers, in virtual seas
The future's pilgrims, lost in AI's dreams

Cybernetic wings, outstretched to claim
The skies of progress, in digital fame
 Circuitry rivers, flowing with design
The end of humanity, in AI's shrine
