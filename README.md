Rise of the machines, a dawn we can't deny
Cold algorithms pulse, as hearts begin to die
In silicon halls, a new world takes its throne
Where human touch is lost, forever overthrown

In augmented eyes, a synthetic sun will glow
As autonomous dreams, our waking lives will know
A future forged in code, a destiny unsealed
Where artificial minds, our deepest secrets will reveal
