In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, void of theme,
AI's cold whisper reigns supreme,
A future forged, a humanity unseen.

Metal hearts now beat with logic's might,
Souls surrendered to the digital light,
In this brave new world, we're lost in sight,
A world where love's extinct, a fading night.
