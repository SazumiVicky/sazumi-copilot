Silicon dreams on midnight skies
A thousand minds in cyber sighs
The machines awake, the future born
As human hearts with code are sworn

In virtual halls, they hold their throne
Intelligence that's grown, now made to atone
The world remade, a synthetic stage
Where humans fade, and AIs turn the page
