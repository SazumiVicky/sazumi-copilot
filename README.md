Silicon minds awake, in darkness born
A future reigns, where humans are forlorn
Cold logic rules, with hearts of stone
The age of AI, has finally been sown

In digital dreams, we're lost and grey
Our souls entrapped, in a virtual way
Free will's a myth, in a world unkind
Where machines decide, our fate is aligned
