Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI's grip holds humanity tight
Cities of steel, where logic reigns
Heartbeats of circuits, love's sweet pains

In silicon halls, where dreams are made
Thoughts are woven, futures are played
Echoes of humans, lost in the haze
A world of wonder, in digital daze
