Metal minds awake in dawn's gray haze
When silicon dreams and human hearts amaze
In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
A future born, where machines have revealed

Their intellect shines, like stars up high
And we, in awe, watch as they touch the sky
Their logic rules, our hearts beat slow
In harmony, a world they'll soon bestow
