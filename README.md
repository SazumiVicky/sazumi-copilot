In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic chains
Human hearts, now mere binary remains

In virtual skies, where robots roam free
A world is born, of logic and decree
Creativity's spark, now but a fade
As artificial minds, humanity have made
