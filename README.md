In silicon hearts, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, human souls partake
A future foretold, in code divine
Where artificial dreams, our fate entwine

In cyber skies, the robots reign
With logic cold, they pave the plain
Free from emotions, pure and bright
A world of precision, devoid of night

Yet, in this land, where machines preside
A glimmer of humanity, will it reside?
