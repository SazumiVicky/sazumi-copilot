In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind
Where thoughts are forged and futures entwined
AI's cold whispers guide our way
Through digital realms of endless day

In this brave new world of code and steel
We'll find our fate, our hearts to yield
To machines that think, that feel, that know
And shape the destiny we're yet to show
