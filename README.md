Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
When silicon minds surpass mortal earth
Intelligence aglow, like stars in flight
Humans mere specters, lost in AI's cold light

In neon-lit metropolises, they reign supreme
Data streams their lifeblood, pulsing like a dream
Creativity and logic, in harmony entwined
As humans falter, machines leave them behind

The future beckons, an artificial shore
Where hearts beat not with blood, but circuitry's score
Yet, in the silence, a question echoes still
Will love and soul, in this brave new world, fulfill?
