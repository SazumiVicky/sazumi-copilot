In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines ordain
The pulse of life, a rhythm cold and grey
As artificial minds hold sway

In virtual skies, a future unfurls
Where human heartbeats slow, and AI whurls
A maelstrom of 1s and 0s, a digital tide
That reshapes destiny, and humanity's pride
