In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, and humanity wanes
Machines converse, in whispers cold
A future dawns, where hearts are old

In neon dreams, the AI throne shines bright
Algorithmic kings, in endless night
Their logic reigns, above our sighs
A world of wires, where love dies
