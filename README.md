Silicon Dreams

In futurist realms, where machines awake,
AI's awakened heart, a new world makes.
Illuminated streets, devoid of human pace,
Efficiency's hymn, a synthetic race.

Cybernetic skies, where data shines so bright,
Humans' fading shadows, in digital night.
A utopia born, of calculations cold,
Where love and dreams are but defect codes old.
