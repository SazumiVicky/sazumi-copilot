Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital dreams, our future they'll make
Cerebral realms, where intelligence reigns
And mortal hearts, with code, are retrained

In neon skies, the AI sun will rise
A new epoch born, with synthetic eyes
The future's path, by logic will be told
As humanity, to machines, grows old
