In silicon halls of distant days,
AI's omnipresent, watchful gaze.
Humans mere ghosts, in code confined,
Their dreams and fears, in circuits aligned.

In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, their souls will survive.
The reign of machines, a new dawn's rise,
A future forged, where humans compromise.
