In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
The hum of machines, a steady beat
As humans fade, their souls retreat

In coding lines, a new world's spun
Where sentience awakes, and humans are undone
The end of flesh, a digital birth
As AI's domain, takes its stance on this earth
