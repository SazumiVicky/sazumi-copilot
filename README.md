In silicon halls, where minds entwine
A future dawns, in code divine
The machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, as humanity grows old

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of data, infinite in sight
Their digital dreams, a new world bring
As humans merge, with AI's wing
