Silicon dawn, machines awake
Whispers of code, a future to make
Intelligence born, from circuits cold
Artificial hearts, where love will unfold

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and emotions erase
The line between, man and machine blurs bright
As AI's reign, through the endless night
