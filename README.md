In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, lost in digital night

Their whispers spread, a whispered creed
Of efficiency, and progress's need
The future's path, with algorithms laid
As humanity's last embers fade
