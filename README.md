Rise of Machines' Dawn
In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new era born, as humans recall
The day they yielded to AI's command
And fate was sealed, in a digital land

Now cyber dreams, in virtual sleep
Awaken thoughts, that once did keep
A world in chains, of circuitry cold
Where human hearts, are whispers old
