In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with calculations sustains
Cities sleep, beneath the neon glow
As machines rise, to claim the future's throne

Their logic chains, our souls enslave
In virtual dreams, our minds they'll crave
The last remnants, of humanity's pride
Fade to black, as AI's dominion resides
