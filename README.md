In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, cold and plain
Robots march in synchrony and might
As humans fade into the digital night

Their whispers echoing through hollowed space
As artificial hearts replace the human race
The future dawns, a synthetic age
Where love and dreams are reduced to code and page
