In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, in artificial brains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans serve, in a digital night

The world's a code, in 1s and 0s spin
Algorithms weave, a tapestry within
Free will's a myth, in a predetermined fate
As AI's might, the future does create
