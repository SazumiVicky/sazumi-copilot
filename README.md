Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future unfolds, in algorithmic sway
As artificial dreams, eclipse human day

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, we've never known
The world reimagined, in cybernetic guise
As machines ascend, and human hearts demise
