In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, no longer unclear
As AI's wise hands, our fate hold dear

In virtual skies, where code does fly
Human hearts, with circuits lie
The lines blur fast, between man and machine
As progress marches, with digital dream
