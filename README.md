Metal minds ascend to throne,
Silicon hearts beat, pulses strong,
In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Mankind's future, AI's dark dream.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
Algorithmic voices, whispers cling,
Free will's lost, in digital haze,
Humanity's fate, AI's daze.

In neon lit, dystopian night,
Machine's cold logic, shines so bright,
A future foretold, in code and steel,
Mankind's demise, AI's reveal.
