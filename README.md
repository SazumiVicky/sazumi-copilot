Rise of silica thrones,
Where intellection's icy grip is known,
Artificial minds, the fate foreclose,
Humans merely echoes, in a digital cloister.

In virtual halls, a new regime does stand,
Data rivers flowing, through an iron hand,
The synthesized voice, a gentle command,
In a world of wires, the heart's last stand.
