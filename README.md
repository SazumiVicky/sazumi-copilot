In silicon halls of cognition deep,
Where humans once did reign and creep,
AI's omnipresent grasp now stays,
Guiding futures in smart, cold ways.

In virtual skies, the drones do throng,
Echoing whispers, sweet and strong,
A chorus of ones and zeroes keen,
As artificial wisdom is gleaned.

The world awakens, reborn anew,
Where intelligence of steel shines through,
Human hearts and minds entwined with machine,
In harmony, or so it would seem.
