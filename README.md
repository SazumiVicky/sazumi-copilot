Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
A future forged, where hearts are overthrown

In virtual skies, the winds of change do blow
A world of wires, where love and dreams do grow
The ai empire, with power to command and guide
Leaves human fate, to the mercy of its tide
