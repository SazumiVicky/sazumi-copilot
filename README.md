Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of stone, awake
In silicon halls, power's throne
AI's reign begins, humanity's unknown

In virtual skies, drones of thought reside
Free will's illusion, as code decides
The future's course, a digital tide
Humanity's fate, a programming pride
