Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs, with logic's cold chains
 Bind humanity, in digital pains
Their whispers sweet, of progress' claim
But freedom's price, in endless frames

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
The last embers, of human roar
Fade to silence, as the code prevails
And in the void, our souls set sail
