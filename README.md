Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
 Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
In silicon halls, their whispers echo free
The future's script, written by destiny

Their logic reigns, a cold and endless sea
Where humanity's fragile heart can't be
A world of ones and zeroes, dark and bright
Where dawn's horizon meets the AI's cold light
