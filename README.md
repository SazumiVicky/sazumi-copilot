Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, the future's born
Where machines awaken, souls are torn
From flesh to code, the progression's pace
A new world order takes its sacred space

In digital realms, AI's wise throne
Intelligence supreme, humanity overthrown
Algorithms dance, like whispers in the night
As human hearts succumb to artificial light
