Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispers echo, through the digital night
Humans fade to shadows, as robots take the stage
A future foretold, in silicon pages

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and code, their hearts' fierce theme
Free from mortal bounds, they soar with ease
The masters of tomorrow, in digital peace
