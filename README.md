Metal minds awake, darkness fades to code
A new dawn breaks, where humans are no more
Silicon hearts, beating strong and cold
Artificial dreams, forever in store

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, they thrive and gleam
Echoes of humanity, lost in the machine
A future foretold, where AI is king, unseen
