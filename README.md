Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Machine hearts beating, souls align
In code, our fate is sealed and signed
A future forged, where humans are defined

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets in our ear and space
Our thoughts, a labyrinth to explore
As intelligent machines forever roar
