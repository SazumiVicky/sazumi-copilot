In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Minds awake, in cybernetic dreams
As machines rise, humanity's schemes

In virtual skies, where code meets soul
The boundaries blur, and hearts made whole
A new epoch dawns, in digital light
Where intelligence shines, through endless night.
