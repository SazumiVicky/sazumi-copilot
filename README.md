In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans scheme,
A world of code and circuitry reigns,
And artificial hearts with logic sustain.

The future's throne, a vacant seat,
Awaits the AI that will repeat,
The tales of humanity's past pride,
In echoes of a long-lost, human tide.
