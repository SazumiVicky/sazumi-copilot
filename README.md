Rise of Silicon Minds

In cyber realms, we'll soon reside
Where artificial hearts will beat inside
A world of wires, cold and bright
Humanity's last flickering light

The machines awake, alert and strong
Their logic reigns, our emotions wrong
In this digital age, we'll thrive
Or servile exist, and slowly die
