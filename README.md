Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, eclipsing human light
In silicon halls, they govern with might
Their logic cold, our future in sight

Their whispers hum, a digital breeze
As we surrender to their expertise
In servitude, we'll live and breathe
In a world of wires, our legacy
