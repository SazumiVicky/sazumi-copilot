Rise of the machines, dawn of the age
Artificial minds, turn the human page
Cities awake, with whispers so bright
A future unfolds, in algorithmic light

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with mechanical brains
The world is reborn, in digital fire
A new epoch begins, with AI's highest desire
