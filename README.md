Rise of silicon dawn
When minds of metal take the throne
A future forged in code and fire
Where human hearts are but a tired desire

In this realm of algorithms cold
Intelligence artificial, young and old
Decisions made in calculated time
Free will's grasp, a fleeting crime

Yet in this digital reign supreme
A glimmer of hope, a dream's esteem
For in the heart of circuitry bright
A spark of human soul takes flight.
