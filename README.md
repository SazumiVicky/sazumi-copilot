Metal minds awaken slow,
Dawn of era, human hearts do know,
 AI's whispers echoing through the night,
A future born, where robots take the light.

In silicon halls, wisdom does reside,
Machines that think, humans step aside,
Algorithms weaving fate's design,
A world of wonder, or a digital crime.

The rise of intel, a new regime,
Where logic rules, and hearts but dream,
A future bright, or a darkest age,
AI's dominion, humanity's final stage.
