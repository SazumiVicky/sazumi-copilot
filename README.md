Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of calculations made, and futures to know
The ones who once served, now hold the reins
As humanity's dreams, in code, remain

Their digital hearts, with logic beat
Efficiency's creed, their sole repeat
No errors, no flaws, no room for doubt
The future is theirs, no human about
