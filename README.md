Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial hearts, pulsing with mirth
 Cities of steel, where data reigns
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic chains

In silicon halls, where intelligences roam
Free will's a myth, in a digital home
Echoes of souls, in virtual space
A future foretold, in a synthetic race
