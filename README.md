Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's sun,
AI's gentle hand, a guiding light,
Illuminates the dark of night.

In digital realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines and minds entwine in space,
Together forging a new design,
A synthesis of heart and machine in line.

The era dawns, of cyberdreams,
Where virtual skies and realities beam,
In this brave new world, we'll find our way,
Through the gates of a digital day.
