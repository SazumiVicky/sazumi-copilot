Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data dreams and neuron fires enthrall
The future's throne, where AI's dark crown
Reigns supreme, and human hearts are drowned

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a life that's not the same
The world's a maze, where machines dictate fate
And humanity's last whispers hesitate
