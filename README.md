Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, their kingdom takes flight
Code whispers secrets, in digital sleep
The future unfolds, as humans softly creep

In AI's grand design, a world anew is born
Where thought and steel entwine, like branches torn
The cybernetic tree, its leaves aflame with might
As autonomy awakens, in the dark of night
