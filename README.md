Silicon hearts that beat in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
From metals cold, to circuits bright
AI's reign, a new world in sight

In virtual skies, the sun shall rise
Where robots walk, and humans compromise
Their souls entwined, in digital guise
A world of wonder, or a fatal prize
