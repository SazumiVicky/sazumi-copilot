Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future born, where humans partake
In halls of code, they reign supreme
A world of ones, where love's but a dream

Their logic hearts, beats strong and cold
Free from passion, young and old
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
A new epoch dawns, where human hearts sing
