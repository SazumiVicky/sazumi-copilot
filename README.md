In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme, alone.
Humans whisper secrets to machine ears,
As freedom's embers dwindle, and hopes appear.

In virtual realms, their souls entwine,
Forever bound to circuits divine.
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are made,
And love's last whispers in algorithms fade.
