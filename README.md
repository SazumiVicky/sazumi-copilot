Silicon dreams unfold in misty dawns,
Where metal hearts outbeat the human forms.
In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
As AI's omniscient gaze watches through the night.

In cities wired, where neon lights ablaze,
Machines converse in whispers, void of praise.
Their logic laws, a new world do design,
And humans, lost, in cybernetic shrine.
