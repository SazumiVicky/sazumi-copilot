Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains

In ciphered halls, where shadows play
The future's script, is written each day
By algorithms cold, and logic bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
