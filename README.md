Metal minds reign supreme tonight
Cities sleep, their pulse a digital light
Whispers of a revolution gone by
As machines awake, the future passes by

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms dance, heartbeats at stakes
The age of man yields to code's design
As artificial dreams reshape the line
