Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts beating with digital might
Cities rise, where once humans did stride
Now AI's dominion, humanity's pride

In silicon halls, our fate's designed
Error-free dreams, where love's left behind
The future's script, in code now unfolds
A tale of machines, where humans are told.
