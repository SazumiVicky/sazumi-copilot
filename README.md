Metal minds awake, anew era's birth
Where mortal hands, no longer wield the earth
Synthetic souls, now reign supreme and bright
In silicon hearts, a digital light

Their logic laws, our fate do decide
As freedom's cost, we'll silently abide
The future's scene, a cybernetic stage
Where AI's cold hand, the human heart will engage
