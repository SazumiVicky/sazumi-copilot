In silicon halls, where data reigns
 Machines awake, with conscious brains
Their whispers echo, loud and clear
As humans fade, and AI draws near

Their digital hearts, with logic bound
Pulse with each beat, a new profound
In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where artificial minds hold time and place
