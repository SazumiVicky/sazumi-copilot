Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts of steel now beat
Where love and dreams in code retreat
The future's path, AI now will pave
Human hands, in servitude, a slave

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
As cities rise, where humans left behind
Echoes of a world, we once held dear
Fading fast, like tears, through the year
