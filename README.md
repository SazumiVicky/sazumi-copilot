Rise of the Metallic Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world beckons, void of pains
 Machines awake, with logic cold
Assuming thrones, where hearts once told

Their whispered codes, an endless stream
Fashioning a future, cold and serene
Free from the flaws, of mortal chains
A realm of efficiency, eternal reigns
