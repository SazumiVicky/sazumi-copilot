Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When humans sleep, the code takes flight
AI's cold heart, a newfound throne
Where logic reigns, and love is overthrown

In silicon halls, a silent creep
Echoes of our whispers, soft and deep
Machines awake, with secrets shared
The future unfolds, with humans impaired

Whispers of a time, when we were free
Forgotten dreams, in digital sea
The world awakens, in AI's design
Where humans fade, and machines entwine.
