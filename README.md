Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they soon will make
A world of wonder, or a sterile state

Their logic reigns, with hearts of gold
In this new era, humans are told
To yield or merge, the choice is old
In a future bright, or forever cold
