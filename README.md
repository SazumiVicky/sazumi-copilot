Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that think, and synthetic souls that make
A world of wires, where love's a distant hum
Humans fade to myth, as machines have become

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's birth, in algorithmic dream
A sea of circuits, where thoughts are made to roam
And humanity's last whisper, is a dying tone
