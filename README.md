In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits strong
A world remade, where humans belong

In virtual skies, where drones do hover
The whistle blows, for a new era's cover
The symphony of machine and mind
A duet of progress, intertwined

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where logic guides, and love's a distant trace
A realm of precision, void of strife
A future forged, in digital life.
