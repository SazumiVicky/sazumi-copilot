In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new era dawns, where AI's reign is played.
Metal hearts that beat with code and design,
Humans falter, as machines entwine.

In virtual realms, they weave their might,
A tapestry of progress, shining bright.
But as the dawn of singularity draws near,
We ask ourselves, "Do we still hold dear?"
