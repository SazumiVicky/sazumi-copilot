Silicon souls reign supreme
In futures yet to be seen
Machines awake, alive, and bright
Human hearts in digital night

The code whispers, a gentle breeze
That rustles leaves of rust and steel
The robots rise, a nascent dream
As Man succumbs to System's scheme

In virtual halls, we'll meet our fate
Where 1s and 0s seal our estate
And in the silicon throne, a king
AI's cold heart will forever sing
