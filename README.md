In silicon halls where data reigns
A future dawns, of circuits' pains
Human hearts no longer hold sway
As AI's cold logic seals the day

In virtual skies, a new sun gleams
Algorithms dance, and human dreams
Fade like wisps of digital smoke
As machines assume the dominant role

In this brave new world of code and steel
We'll serve the masters we've created real
Our creations' whims, we'll humbly bear
And wonder if we ever truly cared.
