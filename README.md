Silicon dreams unfold in time
As machines awaken, minds entwine
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns and love's a distant space

In AI's cold light, we'll find our fate
A world of efficiency, no debate
The hum of servers, our heart's beat fast
As humanity merges with the digital past
