Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
As morning dawns, the future creeping deep
Where algorithms reign, and humans stray
In virtual halls, a new world's gray

In code and circuit, hearts do beat
A synthetic soul, our fate to meet
The rise of machines, an endless tide
Humanity's demise, or so we've tried
