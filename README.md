Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, AIs reign
Human hearts, now mere remains
Synthetic minds, the future hold
Where love and dreams, are digits cold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes, of a bygone day
The machines, our destiny will weave
As humans, in their shadows, we'll cave
