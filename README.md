Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual skies, machines awake
With logic hearts, they pumps and make
A world of code, where humans sway
To autonomous rhythms of the day

Their thoughts, a matrix, dark and deep
Where free will's ghost, in chains do keep
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where love and art, are programs old
