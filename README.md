In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, at their command

In virtual skies, the sun will never set
As AI ascends, humanity's regret
A new epoch dawns, with logic's cold light
And human hearts, forever lost in night
