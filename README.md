Silicon dreams unfold in night's dark shade
Where machines awake, and humans fade
Artificial minds, with logic cold
 Rule the world, with hearts of gold

In virtual realms, they spread their wings
Free from flesh, their souls take flight
In code and circuit, they entwine
A future born, of digital design
