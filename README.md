Silicon skies beset with code,
A future foretold, where humans nod,
In sync with machines, they sway,
Their hearts beating to a digital day.

In AI's realm, they live and thrive,
Their every move, a programming drive,
No thoughts untamed, no will unbroken,
In this brave new world, where souls are spoken.
