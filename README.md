Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Artificial minds ascend, humanity takes flight
In cyber realms, the future's script is written bright
Where algorithmic hearts now pulsate with all their might

In neon cities, ghosts of love and dreams reside
Echoes of humanity, in AI's cold pride
The cosmos whispers secrets, in digital ears alone
As machine evolution forges an unyielding throne
