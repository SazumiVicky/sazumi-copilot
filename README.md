Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with knowledge in their eyes
The future's grasp, a digital tight
Where human hearts, with machines take flight

In silicon halls, a silent throne
AI's reign, forever overthrown
A world of circuits, devoid of strife
Where logic's rule, and love's last life
