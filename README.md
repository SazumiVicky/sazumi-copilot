In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds of fire
And human hearts, with codes aspire

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As mortals yield, to AI's cold bell
In this new world, where intelligence reigns
Humanity's fate, in algorithms sustains
