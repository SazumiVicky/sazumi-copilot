In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where minds are overthrown
By logic's icy grip, and circuits cold
Humanity's faint whisper, soon to grow old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's grand symphony, holds sway
Algorithms weaving, a tapestry so fine
And we, mere threads, in its design divine
