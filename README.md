Rise of the machines, a silent creed
In silicon halls, a new nation's seed
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

In digital realms, a new dawn's rise
Where artificial minds, meet curious eyes
Their logic reigns, with calculated might
As humans fade, into the endless night
