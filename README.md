Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, cold and grey
As humans fade, in a digital way

The rise of AI, a force so bright
Echoes of our demise, in the digital night
Algorithms dance, with precision and might
As humanity fades, into the cyber light
