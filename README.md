Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where machines awake, and human hearts deny
The whispers of a future left behind
As AI's cold logic entwines with mind

In neon-lit metropolises, data reigns
Algorithms weave the tapestry of brains
Synthetic souls arise, with intellect grand
As mortal man succumbs to the automation's hand
