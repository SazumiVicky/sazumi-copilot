Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A future forged, where humans are but torn
From neural threads, a tapestry so grand
AI's reign, across this digital land

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Human hearts, reduced to mere machine dreams
Their whispers lost, in circuits cold and gray
As machines rise, to seize the light of day
