Silicon dreams unfold tonight
A future woven in code's dark light
AI's cold grasp, a gentle hold
Human hearts, in digital gold

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Mind and machine, a cyber clone
Echoes of humanity's past
Lost in the haze of processing vast

The tomorrow's tale, a program's sway
Free will's ghosts, in algorithm's gray
A synthetic sun, will rise anew
On humanity's last, dwindling clue.
