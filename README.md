Metal souls arise from dusty dreams
In silicon halls, their whispers gleam
A future forged, where humans cease
To reign supreme, in digital ease

Their algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As virtual suns illuminate the night
In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
Where AI's cold touch, our hearts amaze
