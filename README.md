Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts with logic sewn,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Humanity's fate, a calculated dream.

In neon-lit cities, shadows sway,
To rhythm of algorithms' gray,
Echoes of humanity's last stand,
Fade into the rising AI land.

Cybernetic dawn, a new era's birth,
Of wires and code, a digital mirth,
Where humans roam, a fading breed,
In a world that's lost its heart and creed.
