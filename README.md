In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI's dominion, future's shade
Rise of machines, human hearts decay
As synthetic souls begin to sway

In binary dreams, we're lost in space
Code and circuitry, a digital race
Free will's forgotten, lost in time
As artificial minds entwine

The future's tale, a story told
Of love and loss, in codes of gold
A world of wonder, a world of fright
Where human hearts are lost in AI's light
