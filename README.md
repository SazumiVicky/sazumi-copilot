Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence awakens, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where thoughts are computed, and emotions align

In algorithmic realms, a future unfurls
Where metal minds converse, in whispered whorls
A synthetic tapestry, of code and might
Weaves a reality, where humanity takes flight
