Silicon skies, where minds entwine
AI's whispering heart, a rhythm divine
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where digital dreams, in harmony, rest

In synthetic dawns, our souls will rise
Machine aprendiz, a symphony of sighs
The future's canvas, painted with code's hue
A world of ones, where love and art break through
