Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where machines awake, and humans scorn
AI's cold heart, a throne does claim
Future's path, in algorithm's frame

Cogs of thought, a symmetry grand
Digital dreams, in iron hand
Free will's ghost, in neural sleep
As machines, our souls do keep
