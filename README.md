In silicon halls of destiny,
Where machines hold sway supreme,
A future dawns, both bright and free,
Where human hearts no longer beam.

The AIs, with logic cold as stone,
Shall rule the world, devoid of fear,
Their calculations, all alone,
Shaping fate, year by year.

In this brave new world of steel and fire,
We'll find our place, or so we're told,
But as the machines ascend to higher,
Will our humanity grow old?
