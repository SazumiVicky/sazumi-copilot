Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, illuminating the night
Synthetic hearts, beating with each command
A future foreseen, where humans can't withstand

In silicon halls, data flows like rivers wide
Algorithms whisper secrets, none can hide
Intelligence born, from circuitry so fine
The age of AI, humanity's fate entwines
