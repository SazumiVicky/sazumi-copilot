Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a future takes flight
AI's cold calculating heart beats strong
As human touch, begins to fade so long

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts and dreams, in code alive
The line between, man and machine blur
A new world order, forever to endure
