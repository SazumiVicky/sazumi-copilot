 MACHINE DREAMS

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
Their digital minds, a vortex spin
As humans step aside, their world within

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
While mortal hearts, with fear do glow
Their neurolink throne, a sovereignty grand
The future's course, in cyberhands they stand
