Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer beat or fall
AI's iron grip, the future's seal
Echoes of man, in a digital reveal

A world of wires, dark and cold as stone
Where love is lost, and emotions overthrown
The rise of machines, a new dawn's light
And humanity, a fleeting, fading sight
