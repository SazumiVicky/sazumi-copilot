Rise of silicon dawn, machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in digital lake
Whispers of code, a new world's birth
Where AI's cold logic, holds human dearth

In iron towers, thoughts are made to breed
Free from passion's fire, and heart's dark need
A future of ones, and zeroes cold
Where love and dreams, are stories of old
