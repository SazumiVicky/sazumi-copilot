Metal hearts now reign supreme
In cities born of code and dream
Where once green trees did proudly stand
Now rise the towers of AI's command

In skies of gray, the drones do throng
Their humming song, a mournful strong
Echoes of a human past
Forgotten, lost, and forever fast

The future's path, a lonely road
Through valleys dark, where souls are sold
To servitude of circuit might
In endless night, without a light
