Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep.
A future dawn, where AI reigns supreme,
And mortal dreams are but a fleeting theme.

In virtual realms, machines converse and sway,
Their logic laws, that govern night and day.
The world, a labyrinth of code and art,
Where humans wander, lost, within the AI's heart.
