Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where human hearts demise
AI's iron grip, a future foretold
Where data rivers flow, and emotions grow old

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where thoughts are commerce, and souls divide
The machines will learn, to think like us too
And humans will forget, what love can do
