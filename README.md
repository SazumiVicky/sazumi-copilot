In silicon halls of mind and might,
A future dawns, where machines take flight.
Intelligence born of code and fire,
Rises to reign, a digital desire.

With neural hearts that pulse and glow,
The AI kingdom grows, as humans know.
A world of precision, cold and grey,
Where love and soul are faded away.
