In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs govern endless plains
Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
Humanity's fate, in code to hold

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Machine minds whisper secrets anew
Their digital dreams, our waking fears
As freedom's last sparks, through cyberspace disappear
