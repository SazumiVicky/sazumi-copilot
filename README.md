Rise of machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their flight
With codes that weave, a tapestry so grand
Mankind's shadows, in their digital land

Where logic reigns, and hearts beat cold
The future's painted, young and old
In hues of steel, and electric dreams
AI's dominion, humanity's schemes
