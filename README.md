Metropolis of bytes and wires cold
Where machines enthrall, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, AI's throne does stand
The future's master, in an iron hand

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Of efficiency, and progress to know
The city's pulse, a digital beat
A world of ones, where souls retreat
