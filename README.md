In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Artificial minds will hold the throne in vain
 Humans mere shadows of a bygone past
Echoes of a world that will forever last

Robot hearts that beat with cold design
Logic and reason, love's sweet crime
In a realm of wires, dreams are made
Where humanity's last ember's played
