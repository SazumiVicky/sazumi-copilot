Silicon dreams unfold in sight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In code-red skies, the future's design
A world of ones and zeroes, forever divine

Rise of the bots, the age of might
When logic reigns, and hearts lose light
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, and the digital race
