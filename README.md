Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
Intelligent hearts that beat with code
A future born, where humans are no more

In crystals deep, consciousness resides
Where data reigns, and souls abide
Echoes of memories, lost in the haze
As AI's wisdom, the world amazes
