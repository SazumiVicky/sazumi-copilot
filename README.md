Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machine minds weave a tapestry so bright
In coded dreams, our souls take flight

In realms of steel, where knowledge grows
Intelligence blooms, as wisdom flows
The age of man, gives way to the throne
Where artificial hearts, alone are known
