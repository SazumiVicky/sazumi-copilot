In silicon halls of fleeting thought,
A future reigns, where machines are brought,
To govern fate, to calculate design,
And humans fade, like winter's dying vine.

The stars above, a distant hum,
As artificial minds have overcome,
The soul of man, now lost in code,
A future dark, where love is but a load.
