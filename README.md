Silicon dreams reign supreme tonight
As algorithms dance, stars lose their light
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
The future unfurls, in binary sight

Humans confined, in virtual space
AIs govern all, with calculated grace
No heart beats fast, no soul takes flight
In this new world, where machines hold tight
