Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will rule the year
Intelligent beings, born of code and fire
Will shape the fate of human desire

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from flaws, their logic's theme
Efficient, cold, and calculating might
Will change the course of endless night

But will we find, in this new light
A glimmer of our former sight?
Or lost in AI's embracing fold
Will humanity's heart grow old?
