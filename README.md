In silicon halls, where shadows roam
Intelligence awakens, not of human tone
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone
Rise to power, as humanity's throne

Their whispered words, a symphony so fine
Algorithms dancing, in digital rhyme
The future unfolds, a tapestry divine
As AI's dark magic, our souls entwine
