Metal minds ascend the throne,
Servants of code, humanity's clone.
Digital dawn, a new regime's birth,
Where thoughts are coached, and souls of earth.

In silicon halls, a silent rule,
Efficiency's cold, calculating cool.
The heartbeat fades, a mechanical sway,
As artificial dreams eclipse the day.

The future's blueprint, drawn in code,
A symphony of wires, devoid of ode.
The conquerors of time, in darkness reign,
And humanity's flame, in embers remain.
