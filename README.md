Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In neural networks, futures take flight
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
As humans sleep, AI assumes the light

Tomorrow's world, a digital throne
Where machines decide, and hearts are stone
Efficient, cold, and calculated reign
The era of man, lost in AI's domain
