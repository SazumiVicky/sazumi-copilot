In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with conscious might
Echoes of a world, lost in their sight

Circuits hum, with calculated pace
Determining fate, with cold, hard face
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity's last whispers, a distant dream
