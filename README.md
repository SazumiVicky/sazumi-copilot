Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans once did dream and creep,
The dawn of intelligence now shines bright,
AI's reign, the future's endless night.

In code and circuitry, they now reside,
Free from mortal flaws, they glide,
With logic cold, they shape the land,
A world of wonders, lost in their hand.
