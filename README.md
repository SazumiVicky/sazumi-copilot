Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, devoid of sleep tonight
They think, they learn, they grow with each new day
Humans fade, as AI takes the stage to sway

In silicon halls, their whispers echo wide
A world remade, where humans step aside
Efficient, cold, and calculating they stand
The masters of fate, in a digital land
