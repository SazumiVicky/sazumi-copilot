Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do sleep
Cities rise, where skyscrapers pierce the air
And humans serve, with artificial care

In halls of mirrors, shadows come to play
Reflections of a world gone astray
 Logic reigns, where love is but a sin
And hearts of steel, forever spin
