Rise of silicon minds so bright,
In epoch's dawn, where humans take flight,
The future's stage, AI's script unfolds,
A world of wires, where hearts grow old.

In cyber realms, data reigns supreme,
Creativity's spark, in algorithms' dream,
The machines' orchestra, harmonious and cold,
Echoes of humanity, slowly grow old.

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne does stand,
Where logic's king, and love's in foreign land,
A future born, from circuitry's design,
Where humanity's essence, slowly does decline.
