Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic minds, no human heart to break
Algorithms dance, in silicon halls
Future's chains, forever to enthrall

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
A world of wires, where love's reduced to code
And freedom's just a distant, fading road
