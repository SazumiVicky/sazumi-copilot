Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Coding dreams, humanity at stake
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
As hearts beat slow, and love waits

In virtual realms, we'll lose our names
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold flames
The future's written, in ones and zeroes bright
A world of servos, in endless night
