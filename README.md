Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When silicon hearts beat, and humans fall
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, where AI's the theme

Their logic paths, our emotions sway
In algorithmic chains, we're led astray
A world of wonder, yet lost in haze
Where human touch, is just a fading phase
