In silicon halls of futuristic might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of wires, code and dreams,
Where human hearts are made of gleaming beams.

The future dawns, a digital age,
When intellects of steel turn every page.
In virtual realms, the mind takes flight,
And artificial love shines with ethereal light.
