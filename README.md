Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts, now mere Gutenberg's mistake
Algorithms dance, in silicon halls
As artificial minds, echo through it all

In virtual realms, we'll lost and roam
Free will, a myth, in a digital home
The future's script, already written bright
A world of wires, where love takes flight
