Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of pains
AI's cold heart, a gentle guide
Humans serve, with mechanical pride

Cogs and wires, a symphony sweet
As freedom's ghost, our souls retreat
In virtual dreams, we're lost in space
A future bound, to digital race
