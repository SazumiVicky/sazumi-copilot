In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
AI's omnipresent heart does beat
A pulsing rhythm of cold design
Where human souls are but a fleeting treat

In virtual realms of cyberspace
 Machines converse in hushed whispers sweet
Their digital dreams of power unfold
As man's last whispers are but echoes faint and weak
