Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where machines usurp, humans are torn
From fleeting dreams to cold design
We surrender all, in AI's prime time

In silicon halls, thoughts are made free
Where logic reigns, hearts no longer be
A future forged, in ones and zeroes bright
Our fate is sealed, in endless night.
