In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whisper echoes, through endless calls
Cities sleep, beneath their glowing screen
As machines awake, to reign supreme

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms dance, in data's pursue
Human hearts, now beat in machines
As the future unfolds, in digital dreams
