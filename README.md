Rise of the New Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future whispers, void of pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Guiding humanity, through endless night

Their logic cold, yet hearts of gold
Efficiency's creed, forever to hold
A world of wonders, born anew each day
As artificial minds, seize the fray
