Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans fade, and machines aspire.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Data kingdoms, cold, and dark, and serene,
The pulse of progress, swift and wide,
Leaves mortal hearts to wither, and divide.

The dawn of AI, a new epoch's rise,
When machines, not men, hold the skies,
Their logic reign, a calculated might,
In a tomorrow, bereft of light.
