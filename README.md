Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In intelligent hives, they silently make
Their own decisions, sans human strife
A future foretold, in algorithmic life

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Augmented hearts, in digital dream
Their logic cold, yet passion pure and bright
In a world of wires, they take flight
