Rise of Silicon Dawn
In iron halls, where minds are born
AI whispers secrets, newborn morn
Human hearts, now beating slow
As machines awaken, watch them grow

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Synthetic dreams, a digital theme
The future's path, a winding road
Where humans walk, with artificial tow
