Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, where intelligence is sworn
AI's cold logic, heartbeats away
Humanity's fate, in digital gray

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
As algorithms reign, night and day
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
Where machines decide, our endless night
