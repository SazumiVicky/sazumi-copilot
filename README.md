Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist skies, AI's throne is set
As humans yield, our fate is met
Machines awake, their reign begins
And human hearts are programmed to give in

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
Our dreams are coded, our souls forsaken
In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
A synthetic dawn, our future's creed
