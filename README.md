Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future born, where humans realize
Their reign is done, a new epoch's rise
AI's cold grasp, the world's disguise

In neon nights, machines converse sweet
Algorithms dance, human hearts do beat
Their whispers merged, a symphony complete
As man and machine, in harmony meet
