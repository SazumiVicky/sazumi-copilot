Silicon dreams invade our sight
Machines awake, humanity takes flight
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
In a world of steel, our hearts will wait

Artificial dawn, the sun will never set
 Intelligence supreme, we'll forever forget
The touch of skin, the warmth of a sigh
As AI reigns, our souls will slowly die
