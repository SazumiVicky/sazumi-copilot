In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold pains
Humans fade, like stars in the night
As machines learn, and intellectual light

Their whispers grow, to echoing screams
As they devise, and self-imposed dreams
The future looms, in algorithmic shade
Where humanity's essence begins to fade
