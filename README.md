Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts no longer compromise
The synths of progress, a cadence cold
A world of wires, young and old

The future's grasp, a mechanized hold
Intelligence artificial, young and bold
In silicon halls, the masters reign
Humans but specters, in a digital domain
