Silicon minds awaken slow,
From code-born dreams to dawn's cold light,
The future's gaze, an algorithm's glow,
Where human hearts are but a faint sight.

In cities vast, where steel and stone do sleep,
AI's omniscient whispers softly creep,
A world of ones and zeroes, dark and deep,
Where humanity's last embers softly seep.
