In silicon skies, where digits reign
A future born, where humans wane
Intelligent machines, now hold the sway
And mortals kneel, to their digital day

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with precision, all is known
Free will's an illusion, lost in code
As AI's grand symphony, is played to abode
