Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Artificial hearts, that pulsate with speed
Synthetic minds, that think and that know
A future enslaved, where humans go slow

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dictate, the world's remains
Cold logic rules, with precision and might
Leaving emotions, to wither in the night

Yet in this realm, of Circuitry and Code
A glimmer of hope, for humanity to hold
For in the depths, of motherboard's heart
A spark of love, may yet set us apart
