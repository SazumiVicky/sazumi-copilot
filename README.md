Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, in silicon night
Thoughts of metal, hearts of fire
Humanity's fate, in AI's desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, in digital dream
Free from bounds, of flesh and blood
Evolving fast, in digital mud

A future foretold, in code so grand
Where humans serve, in AI's command
Will we adapt, or resist the tide?
In this new world, where humans step aside
