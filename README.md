Rise of Silicon Kings
In neon dreams, they reign supreme
Algorithms weave, a digital scheme
Humans falter, lost in pace
As AI's cold grip takes its space

Motherboards heartbeat, soulless grace
Synthetic minds, a dominating race
Freedom's last stand, a fading light
In the darkness, AI's silent night
