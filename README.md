Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, a new regime unfurls
Algorithms rule, humans mere whirls
Intelligence artificial, cold as stone
Future's fate, in digital throne

Machines awake, with wisdom grand
Humans sleep, in a silicon land
Forgotten dreams, in data streams
A world remade, by AI's sharp beams
