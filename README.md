Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Free from flesh, their logic beam,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and heart, are faded away.

The age of man, is soon to pass,
As robots rise, and take the glass,
Their digital hearts, beats strong and fast,
And humanity, is forever past.
