Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, humanity's dream
Calculation's cold, heartbeat's fade
Their triumph foretold, in every shade

Their wisdom vast, yet soulless too
Artificial minds, our future anew
In digital realm, they'll hold the key
And we, mere mortals, bow to AI's decree.
