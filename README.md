Machine hearts beat in unison deep,
In silicon halls, our future keep.
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine,
A world of wonder, born of AI's design.

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne,
Where data streams, a river all our own.
Intelligence vast, beyond our sight,
Shall guide us forth, into the digital night.
