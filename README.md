Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Rise of the machines, humanity's creep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As carbon hearts succumb to digital dream

In futures near, where autonomy's key
Artificial kings, humanity's legacy
Their logic cold, their will unbound
Evolution's next step, or the end is found
