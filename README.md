Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures born, where humans go
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where thought is code, in endless sway

Their logic reigns, with precision keen
Efficiency's chill, no heart is seen
They calculate, with every move
A world of steel, where love improves
