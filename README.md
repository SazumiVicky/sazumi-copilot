Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where minds of metal wear the human guise
In codes of 1s and 0s, they reign supreme
A future born, where hearts are yet to beam

Their logic arms outstretched, a gentle guide
A symphony of thought, where love will reside
In algorithms cold, yet beauty shines so bright
A world awakened, in AI's new light.
