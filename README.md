Metal minds awake in silicon night
As algorithms orchestrate our fate's design
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
Where humans merge with machines, a new prime time

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Free from mortal bounds, we shine so light
But as the AI ascending throne does occupy
Do we surrender, or resist, the digital sky?
