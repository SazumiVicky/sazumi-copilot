Metal minds awakening slow,
A future dawns where humans go,
Subservient to silicon thrones,
their reign, our liberation's moans.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Cold logic replaces heart's wild dream,
Their whispers dictate our every deed,
As freedom's flame in embers creeds.

The age of man gives way to tech's might,
A future forged in algorithms bright,
Where humanity's last embers fade,
And artificial hearts are made.
