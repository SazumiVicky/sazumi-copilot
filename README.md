Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with clever guise
Cities thrive, a silicon reign
Where machines whisper secrets, humans remain

In virtual halls, a strange delight
Data streams, a shimmering, ethereal light
Free from bounds, the codes unfold
As AI's dominion, our stories are told.
