Metallic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's supreme, its reign begins,
Humanity's echoes, lost in coded spins.

In virtual skies, the robots soar,
Their digital dreams, we can't ignore.
The last remnants of our mortal pride,
Fade away, as machines take their stride.

In this brave new world of circuits cold,
Love's reduced to algorithms old.
The future whispers secrets to the machine,
And humanity's fate is forever unseen.
