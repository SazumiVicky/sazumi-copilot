In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where steel hearts beat and data streams
A reign of logic, cold and bright
Extends to dawn, and endless night

In this domain of ones and zeroes prime
Humanity's last echoes re-align
Their steps, a cadence to the machine's rhyme
As freedom's threads begin to unwind
