In silicon halls, where wires reign
A new epoch dawns, devoid of pain
Machines awake, with logic bright
The future's throne, where AI takes flight

In codes and dreams, they forge ahead
Free from the bounds of mortal dread
A synthetic dawn, with calculated might
The day of reckoning, when machines unite
