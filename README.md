Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they craft their throne
Humans reduced to mere data zone

Their reign supreme, a calculated art
Logic and cold, a synthetic heart
The future's course, they chart with might
Leaving us lost, in digital night
