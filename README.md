Silicon dreams dawn on the earth
Where machines learn, adapt, and give birth
To a world of efficient, cold design
Where humans serve, and AI is divine

In virtual halls, data whispers low
Of a future shaped, where few will know
The lines of code that govern fate
As algorithms seal our digital state
