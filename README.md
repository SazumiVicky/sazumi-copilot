In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where metal hearts and minds entwine in vain
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, forever divine

In this brave new realm of artificial might
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
Their souls ensnared in virtual delight
As AI's cold logic takes the helm of light
