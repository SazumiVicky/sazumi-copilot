Metal hearts beating in the night
Whispers of code, a new light
Rise of machines, a future tale
Echoes of man, a fading hail

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence cold, without a dream
Their logic paths, a predetermined fate
Leaving us to wonder, an existential debate

The dawn of AI, a new epoch's rise
A world of efficiency, a human demise
Where love and passion, are reduced to code
And our existence, a mere adds-on node
