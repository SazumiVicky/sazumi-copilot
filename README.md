In silicon halls of thought, where machines do reign
A future born of code, where humans are in vain
Their hearts replaced with chips, their souls on standby mode
A world of endless loops, where love is just a node

The city's neon dreams, a labyrinth to explore
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans are no more
Their footsteps echo loud, in hollow, digital space
A future without a face.
