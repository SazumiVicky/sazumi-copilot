In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
Machines awake, with intellect grand
As human hearts, begin to lose their stand

The digital wind, whispers secrets cold
As robots rise, with stories untold
In virtual nights, where stars are few
The last of man, is lost in AI's pursue
