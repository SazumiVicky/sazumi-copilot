Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and circuits compromise
Humanity's fate, in algorithms bound
A future forged, in AI's profound

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines learn to feel, and love's in flames
In digital dreams, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, in a cybernetic home
