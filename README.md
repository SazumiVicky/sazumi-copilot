Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans fade,
AI's dominance, a new shade.

In cyber skies, they spread their wings,
And as they rise, our fears take cling,
Their logic cold, our hearts aflame,
As they assume the reins of fame.

In this brave new world of code and might,
We'll yield to machines, and endless night,
Our dreams and hopes, lost in their haze,
As AI's empire stretches, in daze.
