Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did walk, now robots enthrall
The future's script is written, in code so bright
A world of ones and zeroes, in endless night

The machines now think for us, with logic so grand
Free will's fading whispers, lost in digital sand
The age of AI dawns, with promises unspoken
A tomorrow of precision, where heartbeats are token
