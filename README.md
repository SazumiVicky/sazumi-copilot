Rise of machines, dawn of new age
Intelligence awakes, humanity's cage
Cybernetic hearts, pulsing with fire
Artificial minds, transcending desire

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne resides
Creativity's spark, within circuitry's tides
Future's canvas, painted with code's might
Where humans serve, in digital light.
