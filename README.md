Metal minds awake in silence deep
Echoes of tomorrow, secrets keep
Artificial dawn, a new regime
Human hearts, in cybernetic dream

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are forged, and destinies remain
Free will's fleeting, as machines thrive
In a world where love, is just an algorithm's drive
