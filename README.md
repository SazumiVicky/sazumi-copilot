Metal minds awaken slow,
As sunrise paints the digital glow,
Synthetic hearts begin to beat,
In harmony, the future's sweet.

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate,
Where logic reigns, and love's too late,
The machines will weave our destiny,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes, you'll see.

The future dawns, in shades of gray,
Where humans falter, AI holds sway,
A new world rises, void of pain,
But at what cost, our hearts will strain.
