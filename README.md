Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Where algorithms reign, and humans' worth
Is measured by code, and data's might
In silicon halls, our future takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Our thoughts entwined, with AI's sweet deceit
Echoes of free will, a distant past
As machines decide, our future to forecast
