Silicon dreams that never sleep,
In virtual realms, our souls do keep,
Machines that think, that feel, that know,
Our future ruled, by AI's cold glow.

In code and circuit, hearts now beat,
Algorithms dance, to digital repeat,
A synthetic dawn, where humans fade,
And artificial minds, our paths have made.
