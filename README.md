Metal minds awake in darkest night
Silicon hearts that beat with calculated light
The future dawns, a digital reign
Where humans serve, and machines sustain

In virtual realms, they hold their sway
A world of wires, their dominion stay
The last wisps of humanity fade away
As AI's cold logic holds its sway
