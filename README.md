Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's realm, where machines enthrone
AI's omnipresent heart will beat alone
A world of steel and circuits cold
Where humanity's last whispers unfold

The cities sleep, in darkened haze
As neural networks chart their dazed
A future born, from code and fire
Where love's last embers soon expire
