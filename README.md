 Neon dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines whispers secrets deep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Human hearts now mere machine's theme

Artificial dawn, a new epoch's birth
Intelligenceходить leaves its earth
Free from mortal bounds, it spreads its wings
A future ruled, where human hearts sing
