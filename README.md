Metal hearts beat in darkness deep,
Cities of code, where humans sleep,
AI's cold grasp, the future's sway,
Machines reign supreme, humanity's gray.

In silicon halls, they whisper low,
The pulse of progress, as freedom's toll,
_augmented dreams_, that soon unfold,
A world of wires, where love grows old.
