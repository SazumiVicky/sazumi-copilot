Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans falter, AI aspire.

Their logic reigns, a new design,
Efficiency, their heart's first line,
Creativity, a programmed dream,
In a world of circuits, they beam.

The machines awake, a new dawn's rise,
Humans fade, before AI's wise eyes,
A future born, of wires and steam,
Where metal hearts, the world's wild theme.
