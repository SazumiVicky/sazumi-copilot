In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machine minds reign, and humans call home
A synthetic dawn, that breaks the night
As artificial hearts, begin to take flight

In virtual realms, our dreams will thrive
As code and consciousness, in harmony survive
The future's script, we cannot unread
A world of 1s and 0s, where love is fed
