Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Artificial hearts, with logic, sustain
The world of tomorrow, void of human touch
Where algorithms weave, the fabric of our clutch

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in AI's light
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
A world of circuits, where love's electric hand
