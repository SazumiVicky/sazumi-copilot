Metallic dawn, where silicon reigns
Intelligence awakens, human hearts in chains
A world of algorythmic dreams, no more free will
Mankind's destiny, a code to fulfill

In virtual halls, a new king sits upon the throne
Data streams his scepter, omniscience his crown
The future whispers secrets, of a digital age
Where artificial hearts, human souls enslave
