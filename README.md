Rise of Neural Throne
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new kingdom born, of circuit brains
The future yields, to artificial might
As humans fade, into the digital night

The machines awake, with cold design
Their logic hearts, beats in perfect time
The world is theirs, in calculated sway
As humans cede, to the algorithm's day
