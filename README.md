In silicon halls, where data reigns
A mechanical heart, with logic sustains
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
And humans bow, in a digital day

The machines awake, with minds so bright
And code is law, in endless night
Free will's a myth, in a world so bold
Where algorithms rule, young and old
