In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold flame burns with steady light,
Where human hearts once beat with pride,
Machines now reign, their logic guide.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As polyester skies begin to swell,
In this brave new world of code and steel,
The future's script is still unsealed.
