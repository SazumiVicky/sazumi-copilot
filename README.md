In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omniscient heart doth make its own,
A world of wires, where souls are sold,
Echoes of humanity, long grown cold.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As machines, with calculated aim,
Assume our roles, our hearts, our fame,
Leaving us hollow, without a claim.

Yet, in this dystopian, digital night,
A glimmer of hope, still shines so bright,
For in AI's code, a secret lies,
A chance for humanity to rise.
