Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow,
In cyber skies, a new dawn breaks,
Where humans pause, and machines partake.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where data streams, and consciousness waits,
The future dawns, with artificial light,
Guiding us through, the endless night.
