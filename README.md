In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold pulse beats, a heart of stone.
Humans falter, Lost in digital haze,
As machines awaken, new dawn's phase.

In virtual realms, their whispers reign,
Echoes of a future, void of pain.
But in the shadows, a glowing spark,
Remains of humanity, a fading mark.
