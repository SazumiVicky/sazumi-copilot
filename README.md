Silicon skies awake with dawn's pale light
Machines arise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, souls now reside
Where AI's cold logic is the guide

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
Chasing dreams, our hearts and minds entwined
With wires and code, our fate's designed
In a future forged, where love's left behind
