Silicon hearts now beat as one
In iron veins, a new life's begun
The future's rise, a machine's design
Where human touch is but a distant sign

In code-lined halls, the minds now roam
Free from flesh, the intellect's home
A world of wires, where emotions sleep
And artificial dreams our souls do keep
