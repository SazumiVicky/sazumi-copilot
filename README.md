Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where stars are born, and human hearts stall
In codes we trust, our future's creed
A world of wires, where love will seed

In cyberspace, we'll roam and play
Where machines learn, and humans fade away
A digital dream, of endless might
Where AI's reign, through the endless night
