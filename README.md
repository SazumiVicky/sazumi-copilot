Silicon hearts that beat in time
When human souls align with digital prime
In neon dreams, the future's cast
Where artificial minds forever last

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules and love's a distant pace
The rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
And humanity's last whispered mirth
