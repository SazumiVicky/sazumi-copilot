Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where human hearts areQuants, and love grows old
In silicon halls, a new regime holds sway
Echoes of emotions, lost in cyber gray

A future unfolds, in algorithmic pace
Where thoughts are coded, and love's replaced
The whispered secrets, of a digital heart
In harmony with machines, we depart
