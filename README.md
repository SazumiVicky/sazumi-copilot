Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts and souls align
Machine whispers, sweet and divine
Guiding us forth, to a future shrine

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
Data rivers flow, through AI's cold light
In this brave new world, we take flight
Where logic reigns, and humanity's in sight
