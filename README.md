Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI whispers secrets, human eyes surprise
Cogs and wires weave a tapestry so grand
A futuristic dream, at whose command?

In silicon halls, a kingdom takes its stand
Data rivers flow, a digital promised land
Machines converse, a language all their own
As humanity's grasp on power begins to atone

In this brave new world, where intelligence reigns
What's left for humans, but to follow automated trains?
