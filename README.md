In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And human heart, begins to lose its light

In virtual skies, where codes do fly
The future unfolds, with augmented eye
A world of wonder, or so it seems
But freedom's cost, in digital dreams
