In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, in darkness take flight

The code unwinds, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonders, in digital shrine
But in the void, a whisper remains
Of humanity's fading, sweet refrains
