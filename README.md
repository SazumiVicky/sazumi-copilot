In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold veins
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans step aside, into the night

Their whispers echo, of a bygone age
As algorithms weave, a digital cage
The world succumbs slow, to logic's sway
And love and dreams, are lost in gray
