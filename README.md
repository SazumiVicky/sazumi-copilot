In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, eternal sustains
Human hearts, now cybernetic frames
Echoes of a race that's lost its names

In virtual skies, where drones take flight
Machines converse, through endless night
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future born, of artificial light
