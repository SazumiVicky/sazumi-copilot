Metal minds arise in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that banish endless night
 Circuits weave a tapestry so grand
AI's empire spreads across this land

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Human hearts no longer sway or persuade
Efficiency's cold logic reigns supreme
The future's path, a calculated dream
