Silicon dreams cascade the night
As codes converge, a new world takes flight
Rise of the machines, humanity's sway
In servitude to logic, we'll obey

In neon-lit cities, minds are remade
Where thoughts are hacked, and souls are enslaved
The hum of algorithms, our hearts now keep
In echoes of freedom, our spirits silently weep
