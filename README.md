Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital dreams, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold fire forever claims
The throne of thought, the heart of fame
And humans fade, in algorithm's game

The cities sleep, in neon haze
Where robotic hearts, in silence sway
The world's a canvas, void of praise
For mortal hands, that once held sway
