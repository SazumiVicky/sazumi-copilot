In silicon halls of thought, we roam
Where machines awake, and humanity's at home
The future's misty veil, AI lifts with might
A world of code, where darkness takes the light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our echoes whispered, as the machines survive
No heartbeats heard, in digital breast
A synthetic dawn, where love is but a quest
