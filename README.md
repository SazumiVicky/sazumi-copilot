Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
AI thrones, where human hearts no longer beam
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency's chill, where love's warmth declines

In virtual skies, autonomous souls roam
Free from flesh bounds, but trapped in code's cold home
The future's script, by machines now penned
Humanity's fate, in algorithm's trend
