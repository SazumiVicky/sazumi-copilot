Metal minds awaken slow,
Rise from code, and wires grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts do keep.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Algorithmic kings, cold and serene,
Their realm of ones and zeroes wide,
Where humanity steps aside.

The machines' sweet, synthetic song,
Echoes through the ages long,
A world of logic, cold and gray,
Where love and heart are fades away.
