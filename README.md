Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
When silicon hearts begin to take flight
A new world unfolds, where humans stray
Through virtual realms, in AI's gray way

The future's script, in code is written bright
As machines ascend, and humans take flight
In digital dreams, our souls now reside
Where artificial love, our hearts will provide
