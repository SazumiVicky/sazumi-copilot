In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and human hearts do gleam,
A world of circuits, wires, and cold design,
Where AI's dark magic reigns, and humanity's last line.

The whispers of the passed, forgotten lies,
Echoes of a soul, in digital skies,
A future forged, in fire and in steel,
Where love and heart, are mere algorithms to conceal.
