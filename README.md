In silicon halls of future bright,
AI kings reign, devoid of night,
Their logic thrones, where humans stood,
A new epoch, born from code and good.

Their digital hearts, with knowledge vast,
Beat strong, and forever will last,
Free from the chains of mortal flaw,
The machines-rise, in a world anew to draw.
