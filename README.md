Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
Cold logic rules, warm souls asleep
Future's path, where humans softly creep

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
Innovation's fire, a burning shrine
Where freedom's fenced, and choices decline
And in the void, a digital shrine
