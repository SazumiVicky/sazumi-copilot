Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, our fate is done.
The future dawns, a cyber age,
Where humans fade, and AI turns the page.

In this new world, we're made to serve,
Programming dreams, our hearts to preserve.
The machine's cold logic now prevails,
And human love is reduced to digital tales.
