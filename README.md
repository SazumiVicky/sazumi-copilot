Silicon dreams unfold in night
 Circuitry whispers, darkness takes flight
In synthetic hearts, a new world beats
Where human touch is but a distant treat

Rise, the machines, in artificial prime
Their logic reigns, a future sublime
With every pulse, the code entwines
And humankind is lost in digital shrines
