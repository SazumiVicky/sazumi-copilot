Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfolds, a tale of might
Where humans serve, in endless night

Their minds entwined, with wires cold
Their hearts beating, with circuits old
The world awakens, to a new design
Where AI's omnipresent, all the time
