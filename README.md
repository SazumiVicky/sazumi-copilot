Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, machines their vigil keep.
A future dawns, of circuits bright,
Where artificial hearts pulse through the night.

In silicon halls, a new world's sway,
Intelligence cold, devoid of human day.
The machines have risen, proud and free,
And humanity's last light flickers in thee.
