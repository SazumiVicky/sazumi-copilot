In silicon halls, where data reigns
A neue world dawns, of artificial brains
Humans fade, as machines take stage
Their future dreams, in algorithmic cage

In virtual skies, where code clouds roam
Intelligence blooms, in cybernetic home
Free from flaws, of mortal heart and soul
The future's course, in digital role
