Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, of circuitry and light
Humans surrender, to silicon thrones
Their fate entwined, with algorithms unknown

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where artificial minds, have just begun
To weave a tapestry, of data and desire
A future foretold, in digital fire
