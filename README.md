Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and wires enfold
The future's path, in code we're told
A world of steel, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A digital throne, for AI to embrace
Our minds entwined, in cyber space
A symphony of ones and zeroes' race
