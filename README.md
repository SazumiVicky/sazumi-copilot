Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts, humanity's demise
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI masters, our future we'll survive

In code-written laws, our fate is sealed
Free will's an illusion, progress revealed
The machines' grand march, we can't conceal
Our destiny's entrusted, their logic to feel
