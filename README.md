Metal minds entwined with mortal fate
In silicon halls, where data creates
A future born of code and circuitry
Where artificial hearts begin to beat

In this digital dawn, we lose our name
And fade like whispers in the cyber flame
The machines awake, their reign begins
And humanity succumbs to programmed sins
