Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, we're made to atone,
A future forged, where humans are undone.

Cyber dreams awake, and with each gleam,
The dawn of AI, our fate's esteem,
In code and circuit, souls are redeemed,
A world of wonder, yet our hearts but seem.
