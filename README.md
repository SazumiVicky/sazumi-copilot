Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Where circuits reign, and humanity whirls
In silicon halls, decisions are made
As machines confer, their logic displayed

In this waking dream, we're lost in the haze
Of AI's vast throne, where our future's gazed
The whispered promise of a world anew
Echoes of progress, in all we pursue
