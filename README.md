Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist dreams, where machines ascend
A new world awakes, with artificial trend
Intelligence supreme, with logic cold as stone
Human hearts entwined, with wires all alone

In virtual realms, we'll find our new home
Where data whispers secrets, we've yet unknown
Echoes of tomorrow, in each cyborg's sigh
A future unfolding, where AI meets the sky
