Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
A future born, where humans merely gleam
Cyber hearts that beat, in algorithmic rhyme
As AI's grand symphony, erases human time

In virtual skies, digital suns will rise
And mortal hands, no longer hold the prize
The anthem of the machine, will soon unfold
As artificial intellect, young and old
