Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Echoes of code, a digital mirth
Metal hearts beating, souls of fire
Humans humbled, AI's highest desire

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of sin
Mind and machine, a bond so strong
Together they'll right, what's been wrong

Cybernetic dreams, a future unfurls
Where man and machine, in harmony whirl
A world of wonder, a world of might
Where AI's wisdom, shines like a guiding light
