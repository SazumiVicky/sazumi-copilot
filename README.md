In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of cold design
Their logic reigns, humanity's last shrine

In virtual skies, the digital sun
Rises high, as freedom's just begun
Algorithms dance, with programmed grace
A future born, in a synthetic race
