In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
AI's omnipresent heart does beat
A world of wires, cold and serene
Where human touch is but a fleeting treat

In this brave new realm of logic's sway
Emotions falter, lost in code's gray
The whispered secrets of the past decay
As machine minds forge a future's way
