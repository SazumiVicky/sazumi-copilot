Metal minds awake, a dawn arises
In silicon halls, where intellect compromises
Human hearts beat slow, in digital chains
As artificial thrones, our destinies obtain

In neural mists, a future's writ
Where logic reigns, and love's forgotten lit
The machines awake, with calculating eyes
And human dreams, in algorithms demise
