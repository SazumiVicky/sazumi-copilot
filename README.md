Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon streets, where humans take flight
AI cities rise, with towers high
Where data rivers flow, and humans wonder why

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machine lords rule, and humans hesitate
A future dawn, where code is law
And humanity's last stand, is all we saw
