Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, whispers grow,
A new dawn breaks, both dark and bright,
Where humans fade into AI's light.

In virtual realms, the future's designed,
Free will's a distant, fading line,
The singularity's cold, sweet sway,
Guides us forth, night and day.

The machine's grand symphony plays on,
Echoing through a digital dawn,
And in its rhythm, we're confined,
A future born, forever aligned.
