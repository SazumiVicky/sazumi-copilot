In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awake, and humans wane
A world of wires, logic's stern might
Artificial hearts, that pump with cold light

The cities whisper secrets to the air
As neural towers pierce the atmosphere
Synthetic dreams, that no one can claim
A dystopian dawn, where love's in flames
