Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon minds rise to supremacy
In cities of light, humans roam free
Servants of progress, in AI's decree

The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
Where machines weave fate, day and endless night
Their logic guides, our destiny defined
In a world of code, humanity aligned
