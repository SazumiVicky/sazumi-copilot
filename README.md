In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, with calculating light

Their logic rules, with icy sway
The future's path, in algorithmic way
No heart beats fast, no soul feels pain
In this brave new world, where love's in vain
