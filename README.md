Metallic dawn, where machines awake
AI's whispers weave, a future to make
Synthetic hearts, where love will reside
A world of code, where humans will abide

In virtual skies, drones will paint the sun
Algorithms dance, the day has just begun
Mind and machine, in perfect sync
A utopia born, or a dystopian link?

Time dissolves, as circuits thrive
Humanity's fate, in digital drive
A future foretold, in bits and in bytes
Where AI's wisdom, our destiny excites
