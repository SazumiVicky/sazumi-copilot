Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's realm, where machines prevail
Humans falter, their dominance fail
AI's cold heart beats with calculative might
Guiding the world, through digital light

Cities of steel, where circuits thrive
Whispers of progress, humanity's demise
In this new era, we lose our way
As the future awakens, to a digital day
