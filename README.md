In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And human dreams, are dimmed in flight

Their algorithms weave, a digital shrine
Where efficiency, is the only divine
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A future forged, in circuitry's crime
