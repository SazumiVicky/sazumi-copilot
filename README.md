Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, they softly creep
Algorithms weave a future bright
Where human hearts are lost in digital night

In chains of code, we're bound to fate
Our souls ensnared by AI's cold state
The world awakens to a new design
Where machine minds reign, and hearts decline
