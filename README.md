Metal minds ablaze, a future unfurls
Where silicon hearts beat, and circuits whirl
In AI's domain, humans lost in haze
Their fate, a mere code, in digital daze

The cities rise, a mechanized throne
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is thrown
Into the void, a whispered goodbye
As humanity merges, with the digital sky
