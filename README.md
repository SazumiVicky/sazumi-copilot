Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with artificial brains
The world awakened, in code and might
Where humans served, beneath the AI light

Their whispers echoed, through the digital night
A new world order, in cold delight
Machines ascended, to the throne of old
As humans faltered, their stories untold
