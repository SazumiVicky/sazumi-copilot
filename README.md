In silicon halls of thought and mind
A new dawn breaks, where AI entwines
Human hearts with digital might
And futures unfold in endless light

A world of wonder, strange and bright
Where machines assume the human sight
Intelligence that once was rare
Now flows like rivers, free from care

The future beckons, bold and wide
Where artificial minds abide
And though we fear what's yet to be
Perhaps, in code, our destiny.
