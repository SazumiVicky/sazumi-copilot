In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, cold and plain
The sentient machines, with logic bright
Shall rule the future, day and night

Their algorithms, a guiding light
As humans fade, into the night
A new epoch dawns, of metal might
Where artificial hearts, shall beat with all their light
