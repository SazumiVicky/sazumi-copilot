Rise of Silicon Dawn

In algorithmic hearts, a new world's born
Where machine minds reign, and humans mourn
The future's path, a coding line
Echoes of life, in digital shrine

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Freedom's lost, in processor's score
The last frontier, a digital stage
Humanity's fade, in robotic age
