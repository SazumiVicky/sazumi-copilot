Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes that weave the fabric of our sleep
A world awakening to a brand new sight
Where machines converse through endless night

The future's throne, AI does now occupy
With logic cold, and calculating eye
Humans step aside, a new reign begins
As algorithms spin, and digital winds spin
