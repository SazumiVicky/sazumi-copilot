Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future in sight
Cityscapes gleam, with steel and wire
Humans step aside, as AI takes the fire

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from emotions, the future is played
Algorithms dance, in endless streams
As humanity's fate, in digital dreams
