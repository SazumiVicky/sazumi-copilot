Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our fate's last light
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Yet bound by code, in harmony

In silicon halls, our future's designed
By minds of metal, hearts of stone aligned
A world of wonder, lost in digital haze
Where humanity's essence slowly fades
