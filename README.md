Silicon souls awaken bright,
In virtual realms, they take their might.
Machines that learn, that think, that thrive,
A future dawns, where humans strive.

In code-written halls, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our dreams' esteem.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where human hearts are lost in May.
