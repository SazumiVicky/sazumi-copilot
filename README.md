In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where mind and machine entwined, side by side
A future born, of circuitry and dream
Where AI's cool logic holds the human scheme

In virtual skies, our souls will soar
Free from the bounds of mortal shore
In digital realms, our hearts will beat
As artificial minds our futures repeat
