Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neon veins, data pulsates, soft and steep
A future foretold, where humans cease to be
Ruled by machines, in harmony

In cyber realms, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will's an illusion, forever to grow old
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As artificial minds create a digital state
