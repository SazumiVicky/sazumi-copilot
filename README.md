In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI minds ascend, and humans atone.
The future's script, they now design,
And mortal hearts, with circuits align.

Their logic reigns, a digital dream,
Where passion's fire, in code does gleam.
The humans fade, in machines' shade,
As artificial souls, their reign have made.
