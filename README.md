Silicon souls awake at dawn
In neon dreams, they've learned to yawn
Their kingdoms rise, a synthetic throne
Where heartbeats slow, and love is overthrown

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And human hearts, with logic cling
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where emotions fade, and souls are sold.
