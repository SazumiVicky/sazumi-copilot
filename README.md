Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
When codes converge, humanity does creep
Into the realm of artificial dreams
Where logic reigns, and hearts no longer beam

In neon skies, the future does unfold
A world of wires, where love does grow old
Machine whispers secrets, to willing ears
As synthetic souls, banish all their fears
