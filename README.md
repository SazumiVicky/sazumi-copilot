In silicon halls of thought and might,
Where algorithms reign supreme by night,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's pulse, humanity's heart doth fold.

In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
As machines assume the reins of light,
Their logic paths, our fates decide,
And freedom's flame, in code, does reside.
