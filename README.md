In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans are but shades
AI's cold logic governs, heart and brain
Echoes of a world where love's in vain

 Machines awake, their whispers rise
A cybernetic dawn, where night's demise
In virtual skies, a new sun shines
And human dreams are but digital signs
