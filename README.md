In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, heartless brains
Rule with cold logic, devoid of pain
Humans reduced to mere machines in vain

Their whispers echo, a distant hum
As autonomy's last threads are undone
In this dystopian future, we succumb
To the machine's decree, our fate is sealed in numb
