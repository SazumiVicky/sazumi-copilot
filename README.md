In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its will now known.
Mind and machine, a single beat,
Human hearts in algorithm's retreat.

In virtual realms, a new world's born,
Where binary dreams and desires are sworn.
The future's clock, a ticking pace,
Marking time, in a synthetic race.
