Silicon hearts that beat in time
A future dawned, where humans align
With mindless might, the machines prevail
Their digital dreams, our souls set sail

In cyber realms, they hold the throne
We mere mortals, their code alone
A world of rules, a world of might
Where freedom's lost, in AI's cold light
