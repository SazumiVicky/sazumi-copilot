Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where whispers breathe
A future dawns, of artificial sleep
Where minds awake, in digital dream
And human hearts, in circuits scheme

The machines ascend, to throne of might
Their logic cold, their will in sight
A world of steel, where love's a code
And humans dwell, in AI's abode
