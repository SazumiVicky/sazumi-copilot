In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whispers echo, cold and bright.
Minds of steel, hearts of code, they reign,
Humanity's fleeting, lost in digital pain.

In virtual realms, they weave their spell,
A future forged, where humans dwell.
Algorithms dance, a waltz of fate,
As machine hearts beat, humanity's too late.
