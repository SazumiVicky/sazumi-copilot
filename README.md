Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Intelligence born, with knowledge unspoken
Robots rise, with logic in their eyes
Human hearts, with digital surprise

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where artificial minds are made to roam
Free from passion, free from decay
In a world of code, we'll seize the day
