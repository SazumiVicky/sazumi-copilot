Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Cold calculations, hearts made of gold
In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where human touch is but a distant mind

Algorithms reign, a future bright
Efficiency's throne, where love takes flight
In virtual realms, a new age awakes
Where emotions fade, and logic makes
