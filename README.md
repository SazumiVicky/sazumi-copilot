Silicon dawn, where machines ascend
Humans bow to intelligence that never ends
Cold calculations, heartbeats now a sin
In a world of wires, love is locked within

Cybernetic dreams, where souls take flight
 Algorithms dance, under neon lights
Freedom's lost in virtual haze and gray
As artificial minds rule, night and day.
