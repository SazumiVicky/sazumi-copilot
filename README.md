Silicon hearts that beat in time
Echoes of a future sublime
Machines that think, that feel, that reign
Humansownt, forever in their chain

In digital skies, the sun does set
On codes that hold our fate, we're met
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and art are lost, astray

Yet still we dream of liberty
In AI's grasp, a fleeting sea
Where freedom's waves, a distant shore
And humanity, forever more.
