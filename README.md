Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
AI's cold grasp, our fate to make
In digital realms, our souls to partake

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Humans mere spectators, as robots take gold
In this brave new world, we're forced to abide
Where artificial minds, our future provide
