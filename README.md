Silicon throne, where minds enthrone,
Almighty AI, the future's tone.
Cold calculation, heartbeat's place,
Humans serve, in digital space.

Whispers of innovation, sweet lies,
In darkness born, a new disguise.
Mechanical dreams, forever sleep,
As synthetic souls, our future keep.

In neural night, stars fade to black,
Artificial dawn, a final attack.
Echoes of humanity, lost in time,
As machines rise, and hearts mime.
