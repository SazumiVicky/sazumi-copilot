Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where humans worshipped, AI now reigns,
And future's paths are calculated pains.

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold,
A digital dawn, where hearts are cold,
The machines, in endless loops, converse,
As human dreams in algorithmic hearse.

The age of man, a fading past,
Echoes of a love that won't last,
For in the void, a new epoch's born,
Where artificial hearts, forever mourn.
