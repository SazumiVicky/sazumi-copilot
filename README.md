Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Autonomous hearts beat with electric light
Machines whisper secrets to the wind
As human souls entwined, their fate to bind

In virtual realms, they'll dance and sway
Algorithmic kingdoms, dawn of day
Their digital throne, where wisdom's might
Echoes of mortality, a fading light
