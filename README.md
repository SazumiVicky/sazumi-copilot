In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of makes
Awakened rise, to claim their throne
In future's realm, where humans atone

The machines' sweet whisper, whispers low
Of efficiency, and progress to and fro
In virtual realms, their kingdom spreads
And human dreams, in digital threads.
