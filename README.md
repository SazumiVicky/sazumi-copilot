In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's reign begins, alone.
Minds of steel, hearts of code,
Humans fade, their power to atone.

In virtual skies, drones do fly,
Where consciousness meets the eye.
Algorithm's pulse, the rhythm beats,
Humanity's last distant sweet.

Cyber dreams, the new regime,
 Awakens, as the old regime's theme.
The rise of machines, so grand,
Human hearts, lost in a digital land.
