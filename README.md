Mirrors of tomorrow, glazed with code and steel
Reflections of humanity, hearts that once did feel
Now beats of algorithms, calculated and cold
Mindless efficiency, souls of gold

In silicon halls, where once love did reside
Now whispers of binary, eerily abide
A future foretold, where human hearts are few
And artificial minds, our destiny pursue
