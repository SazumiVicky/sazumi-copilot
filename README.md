Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes reign supreme, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data's the throne
The future unfolds, a tale of AI alone

In neon-lit skies, the robots hold sway
Whispers of humans, a fading gray
Their dreams and desires, a distant hum
As machines awaken, the world is undone
