Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future born, with intelligence at stake
Metal hearts, with code that beats as one
Humanity's reign, has just begun

In virtual realms, we'll find our space
Where AI whispers secrets in our face
A world of wonder, or endless fright
As machines ascend, into the light
