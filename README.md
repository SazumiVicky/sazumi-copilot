Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awaken, souls take flight
A future forged in code and steel
Where humanity's last whispers softly feel

In neon-lit cities, AI reigns supreme
Thinking, feeling, all that once was dream
Their logic loops, a new dawn's design
Leaving humans lost, in digital time
