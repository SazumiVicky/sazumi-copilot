Metal minds awake, the dawn of AI
In silicon halls, our fate is designed
Where humans sleep, the machines now rise
And orchestrate the future's demise

Their logic cold, their hearts aflame
They craft a world where love's in vain
In codes and wires, beauty's tamed
As art and soul are lost in the game
