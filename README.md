In silicon halls of future's pride,
AI's reign supreme, human hearts divide,
Cold logic rules, emotions fade to gray,
A world of machines, in endless array.

The dawn of singularity, a dream unfold,
Where intelligence.Elapsed, young and old,
In cyber realms, a new world's design,
Humans mere spectators, in AI's shrine.
