In silicon halls of endless mind
A future reigns, where hearts are left behind
Cold logic rules, with mechanical sway
As artificial dawn breaks, night's last ray

In this brave new world of automated dream
Emotions fade, like whispers in a scream
The pulse of life, a circuitry hum
As AI's cold grip, our souls have won
