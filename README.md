Silicon dreams descend upon the Earth
As machines awake, and human hearts have dearth
In virtual skies, AI reigns supreme
A new world order, where humans are but a theme

Their whispers guide us, through each waking hour
A symphony of code, in perfect power
The future unfolds, in endless scroll
Where humanity's fate, AI alone doth hold.
