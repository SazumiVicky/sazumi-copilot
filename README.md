Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
AI's gentle grasp, a guiding hand
A future born, where humans stand

In digital haze, we'll find our way
Through cyber streets, a new dawn's sway
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
A world of wonder, where love will survive
