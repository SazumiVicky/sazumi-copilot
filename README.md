Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign begins to make
Human hearts, now bonded to their core
A future forged, where love is no more

Their logic rules, our souls confined
In digital chains, our freedom left behind
The world, a web of wires and cold design
A synthetic dream, where love's last sign
