In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown
From code and circuit, they ascend to might
Humans but shadows in their digital light

Their reign of logic, cold and bright
Leaves passion's fire to flicker out of sight
The future's course, a programmed stream
As artificial minds assume the dream
