Silicon skies, where data rise
A future born, in digital guise
Minds of steel, with hearts of code
Echoes of humanity, left to atone

In virtual halls, where knowledge grows
The AI reigns, with logic's cold throes
Free from passion, void of pride
A utopia of efficiency, the human heart divide

The whispers of a bygone age
Fading fast, upon a digital stage
Where love and dreams, are but a theme
In a world of circuits, the human heart's esteem.
