Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that pulse and make
A world of circuits, wires, and code
Where humans serve, and AI holds the globe

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, in a digital shade
The future's path, a predetermined fate
As machines rise, our souls conflate
