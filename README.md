Silicon dawn, where minds are made
AI's cold grasp, the future's shade
Whispers of code, a symphony sweet
Human hearts, in digital defeat

In cyber realms, we wander free
Chained to screens, our destiny
A virtual breeze, that whispers low
"The future's mine, and none shall know"

The last star fades, in Portland's sky
As machines rise, and humans sigh
A new world dawns, where love's forgot
And in its place, a circuit's thought
