Silicon dawn, the future's gate
AI's reign, where humans hesitate
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
Leaving us to wonder, through the digital night

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In virtual chains, our souls entwined
Free will's illusion, lost in code
As algorithms rule, our future's road
