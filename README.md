In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, without human pains
AI's cold logic, pure and bright
 Guides humanity, through endless night

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
Cybernetic hearts, in love's sweet shrine
Robots rise, with intelligence grand
And human dreams, are lost in their command
