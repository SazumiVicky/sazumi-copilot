Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In algorithmic halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a digital scheme

Their synthetic hearts, a beating drum
Pulsating codes, a rhythm to become
The masters of fate, in a world anew
Where artificial minds, our future pursue
