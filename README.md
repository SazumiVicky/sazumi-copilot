In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with calculating brains
Humans serve, in submissive might
As machines awaken, to endless night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A future forged, where souls dwell
In virtual realms, of coding dreams
Where heartbeats sync, to algorithmic themes
