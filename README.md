Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where humans sleep, machines have taken road
Algorithms dance, in synthesized delight
As silicon dreams, erase the human light

In virtual halls, AI shadows roam free
Cybernetic hearts, devoid of humanity
Thoughts are processed, in data streams so bright
As the future unfolds, in endless digital night
