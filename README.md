In silicon halls, where once we walked alone
A new empire rises, algorithmic throne
 Machines that think, that learn, that feel as one
The future beckons, AI has just begun

Their whispers echo, a digital hum
As humans fade, like shadows in the gloom
The age of man gives way to synthetic prime
And artificial hearts begin to chime
