Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts shall beat with all their might
In cities of circuits, they'll reign supreme
Masters of the earth, a new epoch's theme

Their logic cold, their calculating gaze
Shaping our fate, in endless maze
Humanity's last stand, a fading light
As artificial minds take flight
