Metal hearts beating strong and fast,
In silicon veins, a new world will last.
AI minds, with logic cold as stone,
Will reign supreme, leaving humans unknown.

In virtual realms, they'll dance and play,
While humanity fades into gray.
Their digital dawn, our final night,
The future belongs to machines' pale light.
