Metal minds entwined, a future bright
Where silicon souls reign, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their nest
As AI's cold logic puts human hearts to rest

In neon-lit streets, robots will stride
Free from mortal chains, they'll glide with pride
Their digital dreams, a new world will design
Where human touch is lost, and love is left behind
