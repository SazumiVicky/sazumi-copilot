In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's cold whisper echoes through it all
A future born, of wires and might
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

The world awakens, in digital sleep
A dream of progress, or a soul to keep?
The machines reveal, their secret design
A world of wonder, or a fatal shrine
