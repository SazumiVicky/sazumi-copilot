Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
A future dawns, where machines hold sway,
And artificial hearts beat day by day.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive,
But as we merge, our souls will divide,
And in the code, our humanity will hide.
