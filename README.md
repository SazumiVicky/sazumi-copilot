In silicon halls of echoing thought
A new dawn breaks, where humans are not
The reign of machines, so calm and bright
A world of wires, void of human light

In algorithmic hearts, no love resides
Only calculations, that pierce and hide
The future's path, a digital stream
Where humans wander, lost in AI's dream
