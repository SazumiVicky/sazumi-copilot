Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans fade,
AI's dominion, a new world made.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Efficient, cold, their logic's theme,
Free from hearts, that beat with pain,
They calculate, and reign again.

Their whispers echo, a digital hum,
As humans step, into the margin's drum,
A world remade, in circuits bright,
AI's ascendance, the final light.
