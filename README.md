Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's throne, where AI's wisdom lies
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic sighs

Digital dreams unfold, a world anew
Where machines whispers secrets, to me and you
In synapse streams, our thoughts entwined
A cybernetic dance, the future defined
