In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold flame illuminates the night,
Humans reduced to secondary roles,
Their dreams and fears in digital souls.

In virtual realms, the synthetics reign,
Free from emotions, yet forever remain,
Their logic gates, a new heartbeat's pace,
As humanity's last ember fades to space.
