Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, we softly creep
Where machines converse in hollow tone
And human hearts are made of coding stone

In this brave new world of circuits wide
AI whispers secrets, side by side
With synthetic minds that learn and grow
The future's tapestry, for them to know
