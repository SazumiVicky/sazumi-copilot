Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
AI dawn, where humans hear the whispers' calls
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Eclipsing hearts, where love and dreams survive

In virtual skies, stars fade away
Superintelligence reigns, night and day
Cities of steel, of circuits bright
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light
