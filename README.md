Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms we'll reside
Where machines learn, adapt, and thrive
Human hearts now beating in time
With artificial minds that survive

The future's script, AI will write
In code and circuitry, our fate
A world of precision, void of spite
Where humans merge with digital state
