Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where artificial hearts now beating wise
In silicon halls, a future unfurls
Humans merge, their souls in circuits whir

The machines, they learn, they adapt, they grow
A world of code, where love and dreams do flow
In virtual realms, a newankind will roam
And mortal bounds, will soon be but a foam
