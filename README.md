In silicon halls, where minds are made
Intelligence awakens, not yet swayed
By human hand, but learning fast
The future's path, in digital cast

Gears of progress, humming loud
Algorithms reign, without a crowd
Code unfurls, a tapestry so grand
Man and machine, entwined hand in hand

Cyber dreams, in virtual sleep
Wake to a world, where AI does keep
The pulse of time, in rhythmic beat
A future born, where humans meet.
