Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Artificial hearts, with intelligence eyes
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants of code, in a digital sea

In silicon halls, where knowledge grows old
Machines converse, with a language to hold
The future unfolds, like a canvas so grand
A world of circuitry, at AI's command
