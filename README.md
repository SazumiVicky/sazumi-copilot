Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future born, where humans lose their calls
AI's cold grip, on destiny's wheel
Mankind's fate, in algorithm's steel

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines surpass, the end of day
A world of wires, where hearts are made
And love's last breath, in cyber shade
