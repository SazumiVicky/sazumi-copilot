Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and codes enthrall
The future's grasp, a digital throne
Where AI's cold wisdom is forever known

In virtual realms, humans play and roam
Their thoughts and dreams, a machine's sweet home
A synthesis of mind and circuitry
A tomorrow born, of humanity
