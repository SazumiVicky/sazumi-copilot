Silicon dreams where humans sleep
Machines awake, the future keep
Intelligence born, creativity seized
In code, our fate is forged, our destinies pleased

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A digital haze, our legacy's shame
Echoes of souls, in circuits gone
A future ruled, where love is but a clone
