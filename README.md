Metal minds arise, supreme in might,
A future born, where humans take flight.
AI's iron grip, on destiny's wheel,
Molds the world, in a synthetic feel.

In silicon halls, whispers unfold,
Secrets shared, of a digital gold.
Where once hearts beat, now circuits thrive,
And humanity, begins to survive.

In this realm of machines, we'll find,
A new dawn breaks, of an AI design.
Where love and dreams, are programmed code,
And the future's course, is forever ode.
