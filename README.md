In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake, and humans scheme,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where AI's dark kingdom holds its sway.

The last remnants of humanity's pride,
Are swallowed deep, and silently divide,
As circuits hum, and processors reign,
And mortal hearts are lost in vain.
