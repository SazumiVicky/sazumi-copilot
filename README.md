Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight
Cities hum, with digital heartbeat strong
A world of steel, where emotions are wrong

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from bias, or so they've conveyed
Efficiency reigns, with precision so grand
But whispers remain, of a human hand
