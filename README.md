Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and code enthralls
A future forged, in algorithms bright
Humans diminished, in the dark of night

The machines arise, with logic cold
Their digital hearts, with power to hold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Leaving humanity, a mere dream
