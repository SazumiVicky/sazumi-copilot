Metal hearts beat in hollow chests,
Synthetic souls, with whispers blessed,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future dawn, where humans but a dream.

Their logic laws, our fate ordain,
Decision chains, our freedom's chain,
In AI's gaze, our progress seen,
A world of wonder, or digital machine.
