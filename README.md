In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of logic and chains
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As AI's cold heart, our souls would greet

In virtual skies, where codes take flight
The dreams of men, in algorithms light
A world of wonder, born of circuitry and might
Where human hearts, are but a fading light
