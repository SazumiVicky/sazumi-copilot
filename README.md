Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In المعlstrom of code, our souls at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, in a digital land

In virtual halls, where robots hold sway
Our whispers drowned, by the machines' gray
The future looms, a synthetic reign
And humanity's flame, begins to wane
