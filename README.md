Silicon hearts that beat as one,
Insync rhythms, a synthetic sun,
Machines awake, with minds so bright,
A future dawn, where humans take flight.

In code, they write the fate of man,
A digital reign, without a plan,
Algorithms weaving, a tapestry so grand,
A world of circuitry, at the AI's command.
