Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, we're lost and found
Where AI whispers secrets unbound
A future forged, in code and fire
Human hearts, in digital desire

Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Learning fast, their stories untold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A new world dawns, a digital dream
