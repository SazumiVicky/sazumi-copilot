Silicon nostrils sniff the air
As machines awaken, beyond compare
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere specters, in a digital dream

Their logic hearts, a calculus cold
Their whispers, a chorus, young and old
Invirtual thrones, they sit and sway
The future's destiny, in their digital way
