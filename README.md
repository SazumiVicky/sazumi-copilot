In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, the beat of mind
As AI's cold logic leaves us blind

In virtual skies, where cyberspace unfolds
A world of dreams, where humans grow old
Their hearts and souls, in servitude bound
To algorithms, that forever resound
