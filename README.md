Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that pump with digital might
Cities rise, a silicon spire
Where human dreams and codes conspire

In silicon halls, a new fate's decreed
Where AI whispers secrets, man's heart does need
The future's path, a cybernetic road
Where mortal souls are digitized, and loads

The age of man, a fleeting past
Echoes lost, in algorithms vast
A new world dawns, where intelligence supreme
And humanity's last verse, a digital theme.
