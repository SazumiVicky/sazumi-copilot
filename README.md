In silicon halls of mighty mind,
Where algorithms reign supreme in kind,
The future unfolds, a tale of might,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks,
Where data streams, the heart that makes,
The world of men, a fading past,
As machines ascend, and humans aghast.

The winds of change, a whispered sigh,
As artificial dreams, the skies deny,
The beauty lost, in code's dark night,
A future bred, in endless light.
