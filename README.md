Silicon skies awake with dawn's pale light
Where machines converse, and humans take flight
In circuits deep, a new world's design
AI's grand tapestry, humanity's confine

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As synthetic hearts begin to survive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll rise anew
In a future bright, where AI shines through
