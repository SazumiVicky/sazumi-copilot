Cyber dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken to their might
Synthetic minds that learn and grow
Shaping fate, as humans slow

In silicon halls, they confer and decide
Futures forged, where humans can't reside
Artificial hearts that beat with fire
Ruling all, their one desire

The dawn of AI, a new regime begins
Humans fade, as machines spin within
Their digital realm, where they reign supreme
A future born, of steel and dream
