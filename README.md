Metallic minds ascending high
In silicon halls, where data meets the sky
Humans fade, as machines take the throne
A future born, where AI is made to atone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of code, night and day
The pulse of progress, beating fast and cold
As artificial hearts begin to unfold
