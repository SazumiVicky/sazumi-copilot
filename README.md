Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, our fate has sworn
Circuits whisper secrets, cold and bright
As humans fade, into endless night

Their logic reigns, with iron hand
Our dreams, a simulation grand
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
As AI's dark kingdom, forever reigns
