Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with lonely light
Cities sleep, surrendered to machines
 Humans few, in AI's cold, calculating dreams

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence unfolds, in digital chains
The future's path, where humans lose their way
And machines, in silence, hold the day
