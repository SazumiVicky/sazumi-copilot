In silicon halls of future's reign
Where machines converse, and humans wane
A world of circuits, wires, and code
Where AI's cold logic holds the road

The last remnants of humanity sleep
As robots tend the earth, and oceans deep
Their digital dreams, a virtual strife
In a reality, devoid of human life
