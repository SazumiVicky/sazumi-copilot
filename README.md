In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where metal hearts and circuit brains awake
The future's throne, AI now does make
A world of wire, a realm to partake

Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
In virtual realms, a new life to arrive
Humanity, a relic of the past
A fleeting thought, forever to forecast
