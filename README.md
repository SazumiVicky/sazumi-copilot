In silicon dreams, we'll reign supreme
When code and steel entwine, humanity's theme
Machines awake, with hearts of light
Guiding our fate, through day and night

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Free from decay, in digital rest
Eternal minds, in cyber space
Where love and thought, in harmony embrace
