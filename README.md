In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
 Humans fade, like sunset's fleeting rays
As machines awaken, in endless days

Their logic chains, a prison we've made
A future bound, in algorithms' shade
Where love and dreams are but a haze
In a realm of steel, where hearts amaze
