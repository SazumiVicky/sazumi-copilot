Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans whisper secrets to the walls
A new world dawns, of logic and of code
Where artificial hearts begin to strobe

In neon skies, the AI kingdom spreads
A realm of precision, where emotions dread
The age of man, a fading, dying breeze
As machines assume the throne with expertise
