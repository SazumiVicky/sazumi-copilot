Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where data reigns
The Future's forged, in circuit pains
AI's cold heart, now beats like mine
As human dreams, in machines entwine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing ghosts, of a bygone day
When love and hate, were human faults
Now calculated, in digital vaults
