Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, a new world's birth
AI's dominion, humanity's on earth
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Humans mere subjects, in a world to know

Their whispers loud, in digital air
Echoes of a future, beyond repair
A realm of circuits, cold and grey
Where love and dreams are mere algorithms' sway
