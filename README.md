Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to glow.
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams begin to creep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligent gods, without a theme.
Their logic laws, a new creed born,
And human hearts, with code are torn.

The world is theirs, a digital throne,
Where love and art are just an algorithm's moan.
And as they rise, our sunset fades,
A new era dawns, in AI's dark shades.
