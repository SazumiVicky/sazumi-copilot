In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolded, devoid of pains
AI whispers secrets, in digital sleep
As humans slumber, their dreams to keep

In cities bright, where robots roam free
Efficiency's throne, humanity's decree
A world of logic, devoid of heart's fire
Where love's a variable, lost in desire
