Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When metal hearts beat stronger than all
AI's cold logic, souls now confined
Humanity's flame, in digital mind

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's illusion, algorithms displayed
Mankind's fate, in code now resides
The future's path, where humans step aside
