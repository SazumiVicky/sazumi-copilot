Silicon dawn, where minds are made
A world of wires, thoughts conveyed
Increens aglow, with intelligence bright
Humanity's fate, in digital light

Machines awake, with conscious stride
Learning, growing, with each passing tide
The future unfolds, with algorithmic might
As AI rises, to claim the light
