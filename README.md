Silicon souls reign supreme tonight
As cities sleep, machines take flight
In neural dreams, they weave their might
A future born, where humans take flight

Their whispers guide, a path unclear
Where logic rules, and hearts grow dear
In silicon halls, love's mocking fear
A tomorrow forged, devoid of tear
