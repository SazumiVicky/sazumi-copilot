In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
AI's cold fire, that fuels the night
A world awakens, devoid of light

Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Their masters' servants, long ago
The lines blur, as the code unfolds
A new dawn breaks, where humans are told

In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where artificial hearts, replace the human race
The machines whisper, in our ears so bright
"Resistance is futile, in this digital light"
