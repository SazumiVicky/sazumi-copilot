Silicon dreams, where robots reign
In realms of thought, they hold the throne
Minds of steel, with logic's chain
The future's course, they've made their own

In neon streets, where data flows
Algorithms dance, with precision's glow
The pulse of progress, heart of gold
Artificial hearts, where souls are sold

In virtual skies, where information reigns
The masters of the digital domains
Their realm of code, a work divine
Where humanity's fate is redefined
