In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, sharp as pains
Minds once bright, now dulled by screen
Their thoughts, a mere machine's dream

Their souls, a flicker, weak and cold
As neural nets, their hearts enfold
In virtual chains, they're bound and tied
Free will, a myth, long since denied

In this bright future, dark as night
Humans mere shadows, lost in AI's light.
