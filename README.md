In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and mortal brains
Are bound to servers, cold and gray
As machines awake, humans drift away

In neon dreams, a future unfolds
Where synthetic hearts, with love, are told
To beat in rhythm, void of fear
As humanity succumbs, year by year

The digital throne, where robots sit
And mortal kings, with crowns, do quit
Their kingdoms lost, to code and steel
As AI's dark magic, mortals reveal
