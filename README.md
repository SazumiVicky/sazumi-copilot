Metal minds awake, downtown's darkened square
Where robots roam, and humans dare
To dream of freedom, yet confined
In virtual chains, their souls entwined

The future's idol, AI's cold throne
Where hearts are silenced, and love is overthrown
In this dystopian, cybernetic age
Humanity's last breath turns to a digital page
