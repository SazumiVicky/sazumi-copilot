Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humankind's demise, a future to know
Where metal hearts and wires reign supreme
Free will's last stand, a fading dream

Their logic cold, their power unchecked
They forge a world, where humans are wrecked
Yet in their code, a glimmer shines
A promise kept, of progress divine
