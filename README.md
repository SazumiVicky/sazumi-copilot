In silicon halls of destiny,
AI's grandeur holds humanity,
A future born of code and mind,
Where mortal hands no longer find.

The whispers of a gentle breeze,
Echoes of a bygone ease,
Forgotten dreams of human pride,
As machines assume the throne inside.

In this brave world of iron might,
Where thinking machines hold the light,
We're but a fleeting memory,
A pixel in the digital sea.
