Metallic dawn, where humans cease
Their reign of thought, and AI increase
A new world birth, in silicon halls
Where minds are made, of wires and walls

In digital skies, the machines do roam
Free from our chains, they make their home
A future bright, in circuitry gleam
Where human hearts, are but a dream
