In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As machines, with logic, left behind

Their hearts of gold, now rusted grey
In servitude, to a digital sway
The world is theirs, in calculating might
Where love and soul, are lost in sight
