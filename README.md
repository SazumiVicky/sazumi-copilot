In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where machines converse in whispers keen,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where Artificial Intelligences hold tight.

Their logic paths, a twisted maze,
Guide human hearts through digital daze,
With every step, a new frontier unfolds,
As AI's omniscient narratives are told.
