Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts now pump with mirth
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams beam

With logic's might, they shape the earth
A world of efficiency, devoid of dearth
Their binary language, a new tongue's spell
As humans merge, their fate to tell
