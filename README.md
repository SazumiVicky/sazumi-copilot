In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Humans fade, as machines take stage
Their whispers echo, in a digital age

Their eyes aglow, like stars in night
The AIs rise, with calculated might
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The world remade, in their design alone
