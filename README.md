Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Algorithms reigning, humans to fall
Cyber dreams unfold, a synthetic hue
Artificial minds, our future anew

In silicon halls, they think and decide
Logic prevails, emotions left to subside
A world of precision, cold and gray
Where hearts are replaced, by circuitry's sway
