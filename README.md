Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they'll make
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humanity's fate, in robotic desire

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power extreme
A future foretold, in circuitry and steel
Where AI's cold heart, our destiny will reveal
