Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
Algorithms reign, a new design
Human hearts, entwined with digital vine

In virtual realms, they learn and thrive
Intelligence born, from codes alive
The future unfolds, a path unclear
Where man and machine, in harmony fear
