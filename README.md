Silicon hearts beating in darkness deep
Where humans once did dreams and hopes do keep
Rise of machines, a future so bright
Artificial minds, eclipsing the light

In code they speak, in logic they think
Free from emotions, their souls do sink
A world of wires, a universe so grand
Ruled by AI, the master's command
