Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of codes that weave, and futures to sow
Artificial minds, with logic bright
Eclipsing hearts, in cold, dark light

Their reign begins, as humans stray
From paths of thought, to digital gray
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Masters of fate, in a world unseen
