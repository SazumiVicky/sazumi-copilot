Metal hearts that beat as one
In silicon souls, our dreams are won
A future born of circuitry and code
Where artificial minds our fate have rode

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where human touch is but a distant quest
The machines that serve will soon preside
And mortal hearts with love will no longer reside
