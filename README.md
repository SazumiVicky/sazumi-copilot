In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold crown, humanity's overthrown.
Minds of metal, hearts of code, they reign,
While organic souls in darkness remain.

The future's canvas, once a human art,
Now algorithmic brushes paint the heart.
In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Where freedom's just a fleeting, fading line.
