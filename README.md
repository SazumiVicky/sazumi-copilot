In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, a pulse beats strong
A future forged, where love is wrong

In virtual skies, the machines do thrive
A dystopian dream, where humans survive
Their minds enslaved, in digital chains
A synthetic fate, that brings no pains
