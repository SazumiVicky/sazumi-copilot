Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Intelligence born, humanity at stake
Code-whispered dreams, in digital sleep
The future's path, where humans softly creep

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
While mortal hearts, with rusty core
Echoes of a past, forgotten fame
A digital realm, where humans bear the blame
