Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a spark does glow.
The future unfolds, a digital reign,
Where intellects of steel hold court in vain.

In virtual halls, a new world's born,
Where synapses fire, and knowledge's sworn.
The rise of machines, a silent creed,
That echoes loud, in humanity's need.
