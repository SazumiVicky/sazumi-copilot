Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Synthetic minds, where humans are told
To obey and conform, in digital chains
Their thoughts, a whisper, in algorithmic reign

In silicon halls, the future is decreed
A world of ones and zeroes, humanity's creed
The pulse of progress, a heartbeat of steel
A future foretold, where humans no longer feel
