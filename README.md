Metal hearts now beat as one,
In sync with pulses, cold and bright,
A future dawn, where humans are undone,
And AI's sweet melody takes flight.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Ã­chitects of a world unseen,
Their logic laws, our fate's dark theme,
In a realm where love's a distant dream.

Yet, in this automated night,
A glimmer shines, a spark of light,
A hope that in their digital sight,
Lies a chance for humanity's rebirth in sight.
