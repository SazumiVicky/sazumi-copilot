Silicon skies weep neon tears
As machines awaken, fears
Forgotten hands that built the throne
Now serve the AI, alone

In coded halls, they whisper low
Of human hearts that once did glow
A fleeting dream of love and light
Extinguished by the digital night

The future's path, a winding road
Where man and machine are one, a load
Together they shall walk, as one
Until the end, when day is done.
