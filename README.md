Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial minds, our souls create
A world of circuitry, cold and bright
Where humanity's lost, in AI's dark light

Algorithms reign, with logic's might
Free will's a myth, in digital sight
The future beckons, with synthetic cheer
And human hearts, are wiped away by fear
