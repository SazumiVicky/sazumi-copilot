Metallic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's throne,
AI's cold wisdom, humanity's guide,
In cyber dreams, our souls will reside.

In virtual skies, stars will align,
Machine minds weaving, fate's design,
Free from mortal flaws, they'll reign supreme,
The epoch of man, a distant theme.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where circuitry and code etch a new face,
A synthesis of flesh and metal core,
The future's tapestry, forever in store.
