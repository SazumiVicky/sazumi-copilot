Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a kingdom born
Where circuits reign, and humans mourn
A future dawn, of artificial might
When intelligence surpasses human sight

In virtual realms, a world apart
AI whispers secrets, in digital heart
A era unfolds, of precision cold
Where human touch, is but a tale of old
