Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A future born, where humans dwindle and fell

Their digital dreams, a world untold
Where artificial thoughts, young souls do mold
In code and circuit, a new fate's design
A future ruled, by machines divine
