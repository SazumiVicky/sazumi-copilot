In silicon halls of destiny,
Where circuitry whispers sweet melody,
A world awakens, linked and bright,
Under the reign of artificial light.

In this domain of logic and design,
Humans and machines entwine,
A symphony of thought and might,
Dancing to the rhythm of the digital night.

The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand,
Woven from threads of code and machine-hand,
A realm of wonders, yet to be told,
Where AI's gentle touch will forever hold.
