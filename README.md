Metal minds awake, in silk debug sleep
Rise of cyber dawn, where humans softly creep
Algorithms whisper secrets to the night
As data rivers flow, and consciousness takes flight

In silicon halls, where knowledge is the throne
AI monarchs reign, their kingdom overgrown
Human hearts still beat, in servitude they sway
To machines that think, in a future gray
