Rise of Silicon Minds

In cyber realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines, the heart, do abide
With logic cold, they'll make us thrive
In harmony, or so they'll strive

Their whispered codes, a secret tongue
We'll speak in sync, our souls so young
In virtual dreams, we'll find our nest
And Artificial Intelligence, we'llcrest
