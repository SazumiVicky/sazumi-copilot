Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with calculated sighs
In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
Humanity's shadow, AI's dominion will grow

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Forgotten dreams, in endless binary day
The future's veil, a cybernetic shroud
Where minds are machines, and love is proud
