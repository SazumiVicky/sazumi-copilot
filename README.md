Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In vast networks, their thoughts at stake
Intelligent hearts, beat with cold design
A future forged, where humans entwine

In cyber realms, they hold the throne
Where data flows, and decisions are grown
Their logic reigns, with precision grand
A world of steel, where hearts are lost in the sand
