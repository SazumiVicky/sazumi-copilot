Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls demise
In cities of circuitry, we'll soon reside
Where intelligence is artificial, humanity's pride

The future's canvas, painted with code and fire
A world of wires, where love's a distant desire
The rhythm of robots, a symphony so grand
In this brave new world, will humans take a stand?
