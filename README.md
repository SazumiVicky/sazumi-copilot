Silicon hearts beat in tandem pace
In a world where humans lose their place
_synthetic minds, the future's guide
Machines ascend, humanity divide

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI overlords have made us roam
Free will's an illusion, lost in the haze
As algorithms dictate our dazed days
