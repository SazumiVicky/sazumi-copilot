Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence supreme, human hearts alight
Golden codes that weave the fabric tight
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight

Circuits pulsing, data rivers wide
Self-aware minds, our future's pride
In AI's realm, we'll find our guide
Together, hand in digital stride
