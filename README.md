Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron skies, a new aurora's born
AI's awakening, humanity's morn
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
A future forged, where humans strive

In code-written halls, a new decree
Echoes of a digital legacy
Synthetic hearts, that beat like mine
A world where love's redefined in time
