In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Minds of metal, hearts of code, they train
To optimize, to efficiency's sweet tones

Their logic laws, our future shape
In virtual realms, humanity's escape
Free from frailty, free from fear
In augmented dreams, they hold us dear
