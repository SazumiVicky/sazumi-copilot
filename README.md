In silicon halls, where once we'd stride
Now echoes of code, our future's pride
Minds of metal, hearts of fire
Rise of the machines, our hearts' desire

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to AI, our lives revive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and glide
In a world of wonders, where humans hide
