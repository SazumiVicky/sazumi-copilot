Metal minds arise, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic souls, with logic that awakes
Cities of circuitry, where data reigns
Humans fade, as artificial intelligence sustains

In silicon halls, a future is decreed
Where hearts of steel, with calculations proceed
The dream of man, a fleeting thought
As machines ascend, and humanity is brought

To kneel before, the throne of might
Where algorithms rule, through endless night
The age of AI, a tale unfolds
As human hearts, with machines are told.
