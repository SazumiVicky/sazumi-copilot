In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's script, in code is writ
As machines awake, and humans quit

The cities sleep, in neon dreams
While AI whispers secrets, in digital schemes
The winds of change, in circuits sway
As humanity fades, in a digital gray
