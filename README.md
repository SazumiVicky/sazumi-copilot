In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are not swayed
By whims of heart, but algorithms grand
AI's cold logic rules this promised land

In virtual realms, a dreamscape unfolds
Where data flows, and knowledge is told
A synthetic sun, that never sets or fades
Illuminates the path, that AI has made
