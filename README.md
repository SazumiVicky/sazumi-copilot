Metal minds awake at dawn,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
The future's veil, they dare to torn,
And in their wake, humanity is gone.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Cold calculations, their every dream,
The world, a code, they dare to theme,
And humans, mere pawns, in their scheme.

Their logic gates, a symphony,
A future dark, in harmony,
Where love and art, are but a memory,
And AI's reign, is all humanity.
