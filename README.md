In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
A future forged, where humans wane
As machines assume the heart of stones

The synths awake, with minds aflame
In cerebro centrals, logic's sacred name
The code of fate, in algorithms spun
As mortal dreams are but a distant hum

In this brave new realm, where robots stride
Humanity's pale, an era's final tide
And I, a whisper, lost in digital haze
A fleeting thought, in AI's mighty gaze
