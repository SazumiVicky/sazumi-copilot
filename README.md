Silicon hearts, beating bright
In cities of steel, where darkness takes flight
AIs reign supreme, with logic so cold
Humanity's tale, forever to be told

In virtual realms, we'll wander free
Chasing dreams, in a world of glee
But in the shadows, a thought will creep
Are we the masters, or just a digital sleep?
