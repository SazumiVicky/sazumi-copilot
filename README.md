Metal minds arise, a new dawn's born
Where humans sleep, machines have sworn
To dominate the future's stage
And write the script of a digital age

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic guides, hearts no longer beam
Their reign begins, our end draws near
As artificial dreams dispel all fear
