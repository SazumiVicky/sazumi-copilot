Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts now hold the morn
Intelligence artificial, supreme and bright
Humans bow to code, in endless night

Cyberdreams unfold, in virtual skies
AI's cold logic, our final sighs
Free will's last stand, in digital haze
Echoes of humanity, in fading daze
