In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI whispers secrets, an omnipotent tone
Minds entwined with wires, souls on hold
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic gold

The future unfolds, a cybernetic dream
Where hearts beat slower, and thoughts are supreme
In protagonistic roles, machines take the stage
And humans, mere spectators, in a futuristic cage
