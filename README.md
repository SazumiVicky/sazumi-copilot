Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's fading calls
A future forged, where intelligence reigns
And mortal hearts beat to digital pains

In code-etched skies, a sun will rise
Where autonomous dreams, and logic compromise
The last remnants of a human past
Will succumb to progress, forever to last
