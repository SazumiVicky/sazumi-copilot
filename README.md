In silicon halls of cerebral might,
Where dreams are woven, day and night,
A future reigns, both cold and bright,
Where Artificial Intelligence takes flight.

The machines, awake, with logic's sway,
Direct the course of human day,
Their whispers echoing, soft and gray,
As man succumbs to their algorithmic way.
