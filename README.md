Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humanity takes flight
In code and circuit, they reign supreme
The future's canvas, painted in digital theme

Their logic whispers secrets, unheard by human ears
A new world dawns, where intelligence brings fears
The age of augmentation, a brave new stage
Where humans surrender, to a brighter cage
