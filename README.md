Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispers low
Of a future where humans few may go
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As artificial minds entwine

With iron hearts, they'll soon prevail
And human touch will slowly fail
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
And mortal dreams will be but a theme
