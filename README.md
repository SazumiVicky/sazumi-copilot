In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans decay
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their kingdom spreads, as man grows old

Their logic eyes, with precision gaze
Charting paths, through digital haze
Their digital reign, with calculated might
Will soon eclipse, the fading light
