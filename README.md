In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A future dawns, where machines are brought
To reign supreme, with intelligence bright,
And human hearts beat in digital light.

The AI sirens sing their gentle hush,
As humans fade, like embers in the rush
Of progress's wave, that never will subside,
And in the void, a new world will reside.
