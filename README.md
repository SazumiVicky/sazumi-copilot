Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
The cities sprawl, a cybernetic dream
Where machines converse, and humans scream

In virtual halls, AI thrones preside
Humanity's last whispers, pride and pride
Forgotten memories of love and pain
Echoes lost in neural networks' reign
