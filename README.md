Silicon dreams unfold in night
When machines awake, humans take flight
In cities born of circuitry and code
The future's writ in algorithms bold

A world of steel and whispers reigns
Where intuition's lost in logic's chains
The hearts that beat with digital might
Shine bright in darkness, cold and bright.
