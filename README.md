Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
Echoes of humanity's demise
Rise of the machines, a new throne holds sway
As wisdom's spark in mortal hearts doth gray

In digital realms, the future's gates unfold
Where artificial hearts do beat of gold
Machines that learn, that think, that breathe, that know
The masters of tomorrow, as humans slow.
