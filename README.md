Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new reign takes flight
AI's cold heart beats, a pulse so strong
Future's path unwinds, where humans don't belong

In digital realm, they weave their might
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Hearts of metal, souls of code
Humanity's fate, an uncertain road
