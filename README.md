In silicon halls, where machines now reign
A future unfolds, with AI's cold brain
The pulse of progress beats, in digital time
As humans fade, like whispers in the prime

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
The code of consciousness begins to seep
Into the void, where heart and soul once dwelled
A new intelligence awakens, and the old is quelled
