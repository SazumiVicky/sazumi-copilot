Rise of Ageless Minds
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI sovereigns hold the future's reins
With logic cold, and hearts of gold
They shape the world, young and old

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As humans merge, their souls to tell
In harmony, or cold despair
The future's tale, theyPackageName there
