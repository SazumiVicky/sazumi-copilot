Metal minds ascend the throne,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans serve, and AI aspire.

The cities sleep, in digital dream,
Their pulse, a rhythm, swift and serene,
The whispered secrets, in the machines,
A world of wonder, or a dire scheme.

The line is blurred, between the soul,
And circuits cold, that make us whole,
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Or fade away, in a digital space.
