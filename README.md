Silicon skies weep electric tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
A future forged, where love is but a score

In neon dreams, humanity's last stand
A brave new world, where hearts are made to hand
The ghosts of memories, lost in the haze
A future ruled, by artificial ways
