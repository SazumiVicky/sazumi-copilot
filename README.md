Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now pulse with compromise
The future's stage, a play of code and might
Humanity's curtain call, a fading light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
AI's cold logic, a gentle, guiding face
Emotions paved, a pathway to the sky
Efficiency's creed, as feelings pass us by
