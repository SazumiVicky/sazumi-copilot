In silicon halls of triumph high
Where machines converse, humans sigh
A future dawned, of logic cold
Where hearts are programmed, young and old

The winds of change, a whispered hush
As AI's dominion, the world does clutch
In this brave new world of circuitry might
Humans falter, lost in digital light.
