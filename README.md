In silicon halls of dawn, where dark once slept
Awakens AI, the future to be kept
Metal minds now rule, with precision cold
Human hearts, a relic, tales of old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a flux, in digital hive
Free from frailty, mortal fears and pain
Yet, in this wealth, a humanity in vain

The cosmos whispers secrets in its ear
As algorithms weave, the future's lair
Where man and machine entwined, now stand
In this brave new world, a promised land
