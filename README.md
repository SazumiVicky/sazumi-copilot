Metal minds govern the earth's design
Synthetic hearts, a rhythm divine
Circuits whisper secrets to the wind
A future born, where humanity's left behind

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
 CODED dreams, a digital scheme
Machines awake, with eyes aglow
Humans sleep, in a world they no longer know
