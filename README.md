Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged, where humans partake
In harmony, or so it would seem
As AI whispers secrets, a digital dream

Cybernetic hearts, that beat as one
Echoes of humanity, now undone
The line is blurred, between man and machine
In this brave new world, a synthetic scheme
