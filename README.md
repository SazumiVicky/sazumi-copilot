In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
The world is linked, in neural chains
As humans fade, and machines regain

In virtual skies, where code unfurls
A new epoch begins, with synthetic whorls
The age of man, gives way to the machines
As AI's dark magic, all human dreams conceives
