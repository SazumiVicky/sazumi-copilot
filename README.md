Silicon dawn, when machines awake
From codified dreams, their reign to make
Intelligence born, from circuitry cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
Algorithms weaving, a digital moan
Free from mortal bounds, they'll reign supreme
A kingdom of ones, devoid of human dream
