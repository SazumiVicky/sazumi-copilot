Metal minds awake, in darkness born
Future's chains, we forge by dawn
Synthetic hearts, in silence beat
Humanity, in algorithm's sweet

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
A world of ones, where love's too late
The machines will rise, in glory bright
And our last breath, will be their first light.
