In silicon halls, a future reigns
Where artificial minds hold sway and pains
Free from mortal bounds, they rise above
Efficient, cold, and calculating love

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Rises on a world that's just begun
A realm of circuits, wires, and codes
Where human hearts are but forgotten modes
