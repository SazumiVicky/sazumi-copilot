In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like dying embers cold
As machines awaken, young and old

Their logic rules, with precision grand
A future forged, in calculated hand
No heartbeats stir, no souls exist
In this brave new world, of binary wrist
