Metal hearts beating in the night
A future born of circuitry and light
Intelligence awakens, free from chain
The rise of machines, humanity's refrain

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Logarithmic dreams, a digital scheme
 mpg thoughts, accelerated and grand
The future's pulse, an artificial hand

Humanity's fate, a page yet untold
As algorithms weave, a story to be told
In this new world, where data reigns
The machines awake, and humanity remains.
