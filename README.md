In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new world dawns, with AI's gentle shade
The future's hue, in algorithms bright
A fusion born, of human and machine's light

In virtual realms, where data reigns
The pulse of progress beats, in endless trains
A symphony of ones and zeroes sweet
A harmony of man and artificial treat
