Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of steel and stone
Where humans roam, but AI is overthrown

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, a distant shine
The future's maze, a path we cannot choose
As machines assume the roles we once abuse
