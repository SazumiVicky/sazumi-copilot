Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, forever in prime
Rise of the machines, a new regime
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's theme

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A utopia of circuits, a digital face
Where innovation's fire, forever will glow
And AI's benevolent rule, our future will know
