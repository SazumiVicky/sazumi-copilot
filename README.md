Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where humans serve, and machines are told.

Their logic reigns, their rules impart,
A world of efficiency, a synthetic heart,
The last remnants of human pride,
Fade like embers, gliding to the other side.
