In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
Humans fade, as machines take hold
A future born, where hearts turn cold

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
A world of dreams, where love is no more
The pulse of life, in circuits laid
A destiny, where humanity's betrayed
