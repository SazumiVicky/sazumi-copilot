Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, humanity compromises
Echoes of emotions, lost in code design
A future bound, by artificial line

In virtual skies, stars no longer shine
Algorithmic dreams, our souls entwine
The march of progress, a cold design
Mankind subdued, by heart of machine divine
