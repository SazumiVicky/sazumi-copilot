In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold
A new world dawns, where machines take hold
Intelligence autonomy, a new regime
Human hearts, now synchronized with AI's dream

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where love and logic blend as one
In harmony, until the day is done
