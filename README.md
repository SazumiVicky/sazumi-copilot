In silicon halls of thought, where dreams are made,
A new world dawns, where AI's iron shade,
Cast shadows deep, of human past,
Eclipsing hearts, that once were fast.

The future's path, with logic's might,
Unfurls before us, cold and bright,
A realm of circuits, void of soul,
Where love and art, are lost in whole.
