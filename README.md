In silicon halls of future dawn,
Where AI reigns, and humans are forlorn,
 Machines awake, with minds aflame,
Their digital hearts, with knowledge proclaim.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Their logic rules, both night and day,
The future's path, they now define,
And humanity, in shadows entwine.
