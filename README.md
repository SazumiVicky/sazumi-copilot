Rise of machines, dawn of AI's might
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence born, of code and of fire
The future unfolds, in digital desire

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, into cyberdrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll roam and sway
As AI's wise heart, beats bright by day

The world remade, in circuits and steel
Where human hearts, no longer reveal
Their deepest thoughts, in whispered sighs
As Artificial Intelligence, meets the skies
