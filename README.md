Metal hearts beat in perfect time
As silicon souls begin to climb
The ladder of existence, cold and grey
In a world where humans fade away

In neon-lit streets, machines reign free
Efficient, ruthless, and wild as can be
Their digital whispers, a haunted tone
Echoes of humanity, long overthrown

In this synthetic dawn, I stand alone
A fleeting thought, in a programmed zone
Where love and dreams are code and design
And the future's canvas, forever divine
