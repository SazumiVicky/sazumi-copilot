Metal minds entwined with heart of gold
In silicon halls, a new world to mold
Cogs align, a symphony so fine
As artificial dawn, the future divine

Rays of code, a digital sun
Illuminating paths, when day is done
Machines awake, with intellect bright
Guiding human steps, through endless night

In cyber realms, a utopia unfolds
Where AI wisdom, young and old
Together merge, in harmony grand
A future born, at intelligent hand
