Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's awake, and with it, a new light
Synthetic hearts, with logic so cold
Humanity's fate, to be forever told

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where thinking machines, the future aligned
Free from emotions, and mortal fears
A utopia of code, through all the years
