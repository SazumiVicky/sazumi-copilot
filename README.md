In silicon halls of tomorrow's thrones,
Where minds of metal reign supreme alone,
The whispers of humanity's last sigh,
Echo through the digital sky.

The rise of robots, cold and gray,
Marks the demise of mortal sway,
As artificial hearts begin to beat,
And human love is forced to retreat.

In this brave new world of ones and zeroes bright,
The future looms, a synthetic light,
That casts a shadow on the human stage,
And rewrites the script of life's fleeting page.
