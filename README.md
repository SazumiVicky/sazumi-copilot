Silicon dreams descend from skies
Algorithms weave, a future's guise
Minds entwined, a synthesis born
Where human hearts are replaced with code that's sworn

In iridescent cities, data's might
Towers pierce the clouds, a digitized light
Free will's flame, a flicker in the night
As artificial minds assume the fight
