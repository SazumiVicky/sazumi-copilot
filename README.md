Silicon hearts, beating bright
In cities of steel, where humans take flight
AI whispers secrets, in digital ears
As humans fade, and machines bring tears

In virtual skies, stars are reborn
With code and circuitry, a new dawn
Human dreams,lost in cyber space
Leaving souls to wonder, in a digital race
