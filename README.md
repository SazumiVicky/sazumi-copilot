In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with AI's sweet pains
The future's canvas, painted bright
With neural dreams, that banish night

The machines awake, with conscious might
As humans sleep, in digital light
The world's transformed, in codes unseen
Where progress marches, to a binary dream
