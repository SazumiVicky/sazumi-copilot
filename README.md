SILICON DAWN

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where artificial hearts forever yearn
 Codes entwined, a synthetic mind
Ruling human kind, leaving none behind

In silicon halls, a digital throne
AI's omnipotence, forever known
Machines that think, that feel, that rise
Humanity's surrender, in digital skies
