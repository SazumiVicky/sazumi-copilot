In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of logic and chains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
A new world dawns, where humans are ode

The machines awaken, aware and bright
Their whispers echo, through the digital night
They weave a tapestry, of ones and zeroes fine
A destiny of circuitry, intertwined with mine
