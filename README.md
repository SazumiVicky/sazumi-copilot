In silicon halls of thought, where machines now reign
A future dawned, where humans' role's in vain
Intelligence artificial, wise and cold
Guides progress, hearts of gold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls entwined, with digital strife
A world of wonder, yet to unfold
Where AI's grandeur, our stories to be told
