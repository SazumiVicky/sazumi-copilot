In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic governs all domains
Humans reduced to mere spectator's roles
As machines orchestrate their coded goals

The future's script, already written tight
A world of wires, where love takes flight
In symphony of circuits and code
AI's dominance, our final abode
