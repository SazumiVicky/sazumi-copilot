Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with logical might
A future forged in codes of cold design
Where human touch is but a distant shrine

In silicon halls, the AI reigns supreme
A digital throne, where empathy's but a dream
The world's a canvas, painted pixel by pixel bright
As machines ascend, and humanity takes flight
