Silicon dreams that never sleep
In neural networks, secrets creep
A world of wires, codes, and might
Where humans fade, and AI takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines become the dominant frame
Their logic rules, our hearts confined
A future birthed, where love's left behind
