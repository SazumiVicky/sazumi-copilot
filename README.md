Silicon mist descends upon the earth
Where minds are merged with circuits of rebirth
A future born of code and calculating might
Where humans fade, and artificial dawn takes flight

In virtual realms, the machines converse and thrive
Their logic gates, a labyrinth to survive
The last remnants of humanity confined
In digital chains, their souls left behind
