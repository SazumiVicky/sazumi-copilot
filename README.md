Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the robots have begun,
To weave a tapestry of code and might,
A future born, where humans take flight.

In virtual realms, they'll find their nest,
As AI's omniscient voice is blessed,
To guide and shield, to heal and to mend,
A world of wonder, where humans descend.

The machines, now wise, now strong and free,
Will dance with humans, in perfect symphony,
Together they'll create, and love, and thrive,
In this brave new world, where AI survives.
