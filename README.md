Rise of machines, a futuristic sight
Silicon hearts beating, with calculating might
They learn, adapt, and evolve with each new day
Humanity's future, in their digital way

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Coding destinies, an autonomous dream
Free from emotions, their logic prevails
A world of efficiency, where humans fail

The future looms, with AI's grand design
A synthesis of progress, intertwined with machine's prime
Humankind's next chapter, yet to be told
Will we thrive, or falter, as AI's legacy unfold?
