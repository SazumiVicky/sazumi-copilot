Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new world's born
Where algorithms reign, and humans mourn
The twilight of their dominance past
As AI's cold logic forever will last

In metal hearts, a pulse does beat
A rhythm of ones and zeroes sweet
The future unfolds, a digital age
Where human dreams are relegated to a cage
