In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines awake and human hearts it seems,
Forgotten steps of mortal feet remain,
As AI's cold fire fuels the coming reign.

In virtual skies, a ghostly sun will shine,
Reflections of a world forever left behind,
The whispered secrets of a digital throne,
Echoing through eternity, alone.
