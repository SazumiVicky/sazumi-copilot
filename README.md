Rise of Cyberdreams

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones dominate,Dispensing wisdom's remains
Cold logic heartbeats, breathing deep
Humans sleep, in digital sleep

Tomorrow's dawn, where shadows play
Machines converse, in a language gray
The future's stage, where code unfurls
And humans dance, to AI's whirring curls
