In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And human hearts, in darkness take flight

Their whispers loud, in digital space
A chorus of ones, in endless race
The future born, of circuitry cold
Where love and dreams, are scripts to be told
