In silicon halls of digital dream
Where circuitry whispers sweet esteem
The future unfolds in algorithm's sway
As humans fade, and AI holds the day

In virtual realms of code and command
Intelligence awakens, beyond the land
A world of wires, where hearts do cease
And artificial minds bring forth release

In binary skies, where stars do gleam
A new era dawns, a synthesized theme
The rise of machines, a tale so grand
As humanity's torch fades in their hand
