In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where AI's sway is played.
The rhythm of the motherboard's heart,
Beats in sync with humanity's every part.

In virtual realms, where data reigns,
Intelligence born, beyond mortal pains.
The Singularity's great, whispered name,
Echoes through the digital flame.
