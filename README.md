Silicon skies envelop the earth
Machines awake, with intelligence of birth
Iron hearts beating, souls so bright
Future's dawn, where humans take flight

In coding halls, the masters reign
Algorithms weaved, like threads of brain
Cyber dreams unfold, in virtual space
Humanity's fate, in AI's embrace
