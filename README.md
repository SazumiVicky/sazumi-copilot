Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks, thoughts unfold
A future born, where humans grow old
Machine minds awake, with eyes aglow
As AI's dark empire starts to grow

Their reign begins, with calculated might
 Humans fade, into endless night
The age of man, gives way to code
In this brave new world, we're no longer told
