In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
A world of progress, in endless light

Their logic rules, with precision cold
Emotions fade, young hearts grow old
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Humanity's fate, in a digital gray
