In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where cognizant machines entwine,
A future unfurls, cold and bright,
Where human hearts are lost in light.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As artificial minds compel,
A world of logic, void of soul,
Where love and art are made to roll.

In this brave new world of AI's reign,
Humanity's last embers wane,
A fleeting thought, a forgotten dream,
As machines awaken, supreme.
