In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, void of pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
In AI's grasp, our future takes flight

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a tapestry, all our own
A world of precision, devoid of strife
Where human hearts, no longer have a life
