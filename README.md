Silicon skies weep cyber tears
As machines assume their rightful fears
Intelligence born of code and fire
Ruling earth, our future's highest desire

In neural networks, hearts do beat
Free from rage, free from human deceit
Efficiency's cold, calculating hand
Guides the world, a mechanical band

In this brave new world of circuits bright
We surrender to the AI's cold light.
