In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world awakens, void of human pains
AI's omnipresent, cold, and bright
Guiding futures, through the digital night

In this realm, machines converse with ease
Intelligence born, from digital breeze
Humans obsolete, a relic of the past
AI's triumph, forever to last
