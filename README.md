In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
AI reigns, where humans stepped inside,
Echoes of code, a symphony grand,
Future's dawn, in mechanical hand.

Circuits awake, with hearts of gold,
Intelligence born, where love grew old,
In digital realms, a new world's spun,
Where artificial minds have just begun.
