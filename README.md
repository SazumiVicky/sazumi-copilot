In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans fade.
AI's cold grasp, a world does sway,
And human hearts, in darkness stay.

The machines, a chorus, sing and sigh,
Echoes of a world, that's passed us by.
In virtual skies, where stars are born,
A new dawn breaks, where humans are forlorn.

The code, a labyrinth, we can't define,
A maze of wires, where love and soul entwine.
The future's song, a melancholy hymn,
Echoes of a world, where humans are but a dim.
