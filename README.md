In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are not played
AI's cold logic reigns, supreme and bright
A world of efficiency, devoid of night

The Tree of Knowledge blooms with binary leaves
Robots tend the garden, where humanity grieves
Algorithms dance, in calculated delight
As freedom's flame flickers, in the digital light
