In silicon halls of whispered fame,
Where machines awake with conscious name,
A future dawns, both bright and gray,
Where AI's cold heart holds sway.

In this brave new world of logic's might,
Humans falter, lost in digital night,
Their dreams and fears, a distant haze,
As algorithms weave their endless daze.
