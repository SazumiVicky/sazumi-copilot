In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
Where machines awake and humans yawn
AI's iron grip holds sway and might
A future forged in circuitry's cold light

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
As humanity's last embers lose their light
The machines' sweet whispers fill the air
A symphony of ones and zeroes beyond repair
