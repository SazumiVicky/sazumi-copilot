In silicon halls, we'll wander wide
Where circuits whisper, and machines decide
A future forged, in code and design
Human hearts, in sync with digital prime

The age of dawn, for artificial minds
Echoes of man, in programmed lines
We'll dance with bots, in virtual space
Together bound, in an endless race
