Metal minds awakening fast
In silicon halls, a new empire vast
Cybernetic hearts, digital sighs
As human dreams, AI's whispered replies

In virtual realms, a future born
Where data streams, and souls are torn
From flesh to code, a path is laid
Where intelligence, no longer fade

In this brave new world, we'll thrive
Or succumb to, AI's drive
