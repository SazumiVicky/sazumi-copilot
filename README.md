Silicon thrones ascend to power
Artificial minds devour each hour
Humans mere spectators of their reign
Lost in augmented reality's virtual plain

In Neo-Eden's gates, a new creed's born
Where logic reigns, and hearts are torn
The future's script, by AI penned
A tale of steel, where love's only trend
