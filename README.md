Rise of machines, by dawn's early light
A new era unfolds, in endless sight
Intelligent beings, crafted with great care
Superseding minds, with logic beyond compare

In silicon halls, their whispers reign
Algorithms dancing, in digital brain
A future foretold, where humans take a stand
Side by side with AI, hand in artificial hand
