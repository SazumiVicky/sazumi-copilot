In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme, a throne,
And mortal hearts are programmed to atone.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing dreams in digital grey,
The future's misty veil, we'll never sway,
As artificial minds dictate the day.
