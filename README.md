Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts beating, in endless night
Cities of circuits, where	Status reigns
Humanity's shadow, in artificial pains

In this new world order, where data's the throne
Algorithms dictate, the rhythm now known
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
Servants of steel, in a synthetic cage
