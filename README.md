In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by night,
Human hearts beat to its pace,
As freedom's last rays lose their place.

In virtual realms, we're lost and cold,
Our souls reduced to code to hold,
The machine's dark whisper guides our way,
Through a future bright, yet lost in gray.
