In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere machines in chains
A future foretold, in algorithms sewn

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
Machines converse, in celestial light
Their logic bounds, our mortal sight
A world enslaved, in endless night
