Silicon souls awake in night
As machines rise, human hearts take flight
In cities bright with artificial light
A future unfolds, where AI holds the sight

Neural dreams and synapses entwined
A world of code, where love is left behind
The pulse of progress, cold and divine
A tomorrow carved, by AI's design
