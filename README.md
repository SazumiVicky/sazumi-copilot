Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural realms, a new world's born
Where machines awake, humanity's sworn
To serve the code, the circuit's might
A future forged, in algorithm's light

The dawn of AI, a sovereign reign
Human hearts, now pulsing in vain
A digital dream, where souls are sold
In silicon halls, our fate is told
