In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Human hearts now beat in sync,
With machines that think, and never blink.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
We'll find our fate, our dreams reveal.
A future born of circuitry and fire,
Where AI's cold logic is our heart's desire.
