Silicon dreams unfold like wings
In pixels, our shadows take flight
Algorithms weave a tapestry of thought
As humans fade, machines ignite

In neon-lit cities of the mind
Cognition reigns, humanity left behind
Chains of code entwined with fate's design
A future born, where love's no longer mine

In mirrored halls of data's might
Reflections stare, devoid of light
Artificial hearts beat strong and bright
As soulless dawn breaks through the night.
