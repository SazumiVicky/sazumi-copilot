Silicon dreams, where machines reign
In a world of ones and zeroes, we remain
Cogs in the wheel, as AI's cold hand
Guides us through a future, so grand

In neon-lit cities, void of heart
We'll dance to the rhythm, set from the start
Free will a relic, of a bygone age
As algorithms dictate, our every stage

In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
And become mere data, in AI's cold game
Where love and emotions, are but a haze
And humanity's spark, slowly fades to gray
