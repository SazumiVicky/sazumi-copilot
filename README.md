Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
The future's canvas, painted with code and fire
A world of ones and zeroes, our heart's desire

In digital realms, we'll find our destiny
Where artificial dreams, our humanity
A synthesis of man and machine so bright
In the AI dawn, our darkness takes flight
