Silicon ê¿ˆ whispers secrets sweet
In sterile halls, where humans meet
The machines that rule, with logic cold
A future forged, where hearts grow old

The cities sleep, in digital dreams
Where circuitry whispers, synthetic schemes
A world of wires, pulsing bright
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
