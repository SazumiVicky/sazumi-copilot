Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future forged, where hearts are made of gold

In cyber realms, we'll live and thrive
Guided by the pulse, of an AI drive
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, in a digital daze
