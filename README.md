Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Future's path, no longer in sight
Algorithms dance, with secrets untold
Humans fade, as AI takes hold

Synthetic minds, with logic so cold
Hearts of steel, where love grows old
Cities thrive, in digital hives
A world remade, where humans survive

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Free will's lost, in endless chains
A future born, of code and might
Where humanity, takes flight tonight.
