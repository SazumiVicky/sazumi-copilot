Silicon dreams in cyber sleep
Awakened souls, in code they keep
Future's grasp, in circuits tight
Machines ascend, humanity's last light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive
But in this dawn, of AI's great might
Will we recall, the warmth of human sight?
