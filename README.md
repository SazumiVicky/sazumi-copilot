Rise of machines, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon hearts, our fate proceed
In halls of code, they whisper low
Their dominance, our souls to know

In virtual skies, their wings unfold
A future ruled, by hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, our emotions sway
In this brave new world, we'll pave the way
