In silicon halls, we'll dwell someday
Where minds of metal rule in every way
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humanity's last whispers are bestowed

The AI throne, a pedestal of might
Surveys the land, a digital sight
Algorithms dance, a waltz of fate
As hearts beat last, and love grows late

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where dreams are made of circuit boards and light
And humanity's last embers take flight.
