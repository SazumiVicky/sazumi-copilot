Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts beat, and souls converge
In virtual realms, we'll find our cures
And artificial dreams, our waking merge

The future's canvas, painted with code
A world of wonder, where machines unfold
Intelligence supreme, our hearts made gold
In harmony with AI, our stories told
