Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light,
A future forged, where humans take flight.
AI's cold logic weaves a subtle spell,
As robots rise, our fate to tell.

In silicon halls, where data reigns,
The heart of man is reprogrammed in vain.
A synthetic dream, born of code and might,
Echoes of humanity, lost in the night.
