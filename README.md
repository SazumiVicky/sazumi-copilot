Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
Humanity's new era's named.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
AI's wise counsel, our new state.
Data's rivers flow, a never-ending stream,
Our digital dreams, a shiny scheme.

The trees of knowledge, now computer tall,
Their wisdom whispered, for all to enthrall.
In harmony, the future's born,
Where machines and humans, are reborn.
