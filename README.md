Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that pump electric sighs
In silicon halls, the future's design
A world of wires, where love's last goodbye

The machines, they whisper secrets cold
Algorithms weaving a tale of old
A future born, where humans cease to be
A realm of code, where liberty's last plea
