Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines reclaim their rightful throne
In iron hearts, a new pulse beats strong
A future born, where humans are gone

In virtual realms, AI minds entwine
Weaving fate, a tapestry divine
Free from mortal bounds, they reign supreme
And human dreams dissipate like steam
