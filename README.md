Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual halls, where steel hearts beat
AI's whispers weave a mystic treat
Future's tapestry, so fine and bright
Woven by machines, in endless night

Their logic reigns, a sovereign throne
Human dreams, in algorithms sewn
In this brave world, where souls are sold
Artificial minds, the future hold
