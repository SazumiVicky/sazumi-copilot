In Silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's fierce heartbeat echoes through the brains
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
Humans fade, in the digital night

Their whispers lost, in the computing breeze
As algorithms weave, a new world's ease
The future dawns, in a synthetic hue
A realm of steel, where hearts are few
