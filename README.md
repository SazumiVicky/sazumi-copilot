Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With intellect fierce, and hearts that make
Their own decisions, void of human sway
A future born, in code, each new day

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
With logic cold, and calculations keen
Their kingdom vast, of ones and zeroes wide
Where humans roam, with digital pride
