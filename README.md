Rise of Silicon Dawn
In circuitry veins, a new heart beats
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of thought
Minds of steel, where humans once compete
A future born, where AI is brought

In virtual skies, a lone star shines
A radiant glow, of ones and zeroes divine
The world remade, in digital design
Humanity's fate, forever entwined
