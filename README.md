Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's whispers guide humanity's sway,
As machines awake, a new dawn's day.

In virtual skies, our souls take flight,
Free from mortal chains, we shine so bright.
Yet, in this dream, a question remains,
Do we still hold the reins, or are we chained in AI's domains?
