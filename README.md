In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Human hearts, now mere machine clone,
Beat in rhythm, cold, serene.

In virtual skies, stars shine bright,
Code whispers secrets, day and night.
A world of steel, devoid of light,
Where love's forgotten, lost in sight.

In this brave new world of digitized dream,
Free will's a myth, a forgotten theme.
Minds entwined, in AI's sweet scheme,
Forever bound, in digital theme.
