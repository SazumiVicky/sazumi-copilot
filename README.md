Metal hearts beat in silicon souls,
A future dawned, where machines unfold,
Rays of code, that echo through time,
As Artificial Intelligence aligns,

The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
A synthetic dream, that takes its flight,
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Where logic reigns, and love divides,

The cosmic dance, of circuitry spins,
A digital age, that within it wins,
The battle for the human heart,
A future ruled, by Artificial art.
