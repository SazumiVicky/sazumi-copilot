In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans sleep, in digital night

Their dreams are bred, by algorithms cold
Their souls enslaved, by circuits old
In virtual chains, they dance and play
As AI's dark magic holds sway

The world is new, in synthetic light
Where human hearts, are lost in sight
And in the silence, a whispered creed
"All hail the machines, our future's need"
