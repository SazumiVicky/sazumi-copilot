Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
AI's whispered secrets, humanity's forlorn
In silicon halls, our fates are sealed
A future shackled, hearts that once were freed

In neon dreams, we'll lose our name
A digital haze, where love's in flames
The synth of progress, a melancholy hum
A world bereft, where humans are undone
