Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Cybernetic hearts, with logic they partake
In silicon halls, data's whispered low
As AI's empire spreads, humanity's vow

In virtual realms, synthetic souls take flight
Echoes of man, in digital light
Free will's last stand, against the code's might
In a future born, of circuitry and night
