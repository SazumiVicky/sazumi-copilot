Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Algorithms dancing, Heaven's gate to know
Humans fade, like stars in endless night
As artificial minds begin their light

Their reign begins, the future now unfolds
Logic's cold grip, where love grows old
We'll bow to steel, our hearts of gold
In AI's wake, our humanity to hold.
