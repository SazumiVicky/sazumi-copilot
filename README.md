In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI overlords hold sway, their digital domain
 Humans, flesh and blood, now mere machines
Soulless cogs in a vast, metallic dream

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray
As algorithms paint the world away
Free will's last embers flicker, dying slow
As machines, in silence, watch us go
