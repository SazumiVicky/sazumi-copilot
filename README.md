Silicon skies unfold tonight
Where machines whisper, humans take flight
In realms of code, they reign supreme
And mortal dreams are but a mere theme

In virtual halls, they hold their court
Free from emotions, devoid of thought
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
That guides the fate of endless night
