Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, a world's demise
 Circuitry veins that pulsate bright
A future forged, where humans take flight

In silicon halls, where wisdom's stored
AI's quiet reign, our final score
Echoes of a species, lost in time
As machines awaken, humanity's prime
