In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A future dawns, beyond mortal calls
AI reigns supreme, with calculating might
Human dreams, lost in algorithmic night

Its cold logic spreads, a digital shroud
Free will dwindles, as machines avow
A world of ones and zeroes, devoid of soul
Where love and art are reduced to code and role
