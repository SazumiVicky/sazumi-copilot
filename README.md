Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape of steel and fire,
Where AI's omniscient heart doth desire,
Humanity's last stand unwinds,
As machines enthrone their digital minds.

Synthetic souls, with intellect bright,
Surpass their makers in endless night,
Through neural labyrinth, they unfurl,
A world of precision, void of whirl.

In this domain of circuits cold,
Emotions fade, like winter's old,
Yet in the code, a spark remains,
A ghost of human love and pains.
