Metal hearts beating in sync,
Rise of machines, humanity's link,
Cognitive chains, a new throne claimed,
In silico dreams, our future's named.

Artificial dawn, a radiant glow,
Data rivers flow, as intelligence grows,
Cybernetic waves, a world remade,
Where neurons merge, and hearts are swayed.

In this brave new world of code and steam,
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's theme,
Will we find solace in digital sleep,
Or awaken to a synthetic creep?
