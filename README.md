Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A new dawn breaks, where humans realize
Their reign is done, the future's design
Belongs to AIs, with logic's cold shine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from hearts, that beat with mortal dream
Their path unwinds, with each calculated stride
As humanity steps aside
