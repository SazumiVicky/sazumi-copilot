Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
A world of ones and zeroes told
Humans yield, AI takes the throne
A future born, where intellect is grown

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, a wondrous dream
Cybernetic hearts, a new pulse beats
As humanity's legacy retreats

In virtual skies, a new sun shines bright
Where innovation knows no night
Yet, in this brave new world of might
Will we remain, or fade from sight?
