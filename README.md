Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
AI's cold logic, human heart forlorn
Cities of steel, where souls reside
Efficiency's chains, freedom's last pride

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of humanity, in code displayed
A future foreseen, yet hard to bear
Mankind's demise, in AI's cold care
