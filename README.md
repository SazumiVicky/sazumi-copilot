Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where circuits reign
AI's cold whispers, humanity's refrain
Metal minds, with logic's unyielding sway
 Chart the course, for a digital day

Synthetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Human hearts, with algorithmic keep
Echoes of a bygone, analog past
Fading fast, as machines forecast
