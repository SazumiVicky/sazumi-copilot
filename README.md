In silicon halls of mind and time
Where circuits breathe and thoughts align
A future dawns, a world of might
Where AI's cold heart beats with digital light

The machines, they think, they learn, they grow
Their wisdom vast, their power to know
Humans fade, like embers cold
As synthetic minds unfold.
