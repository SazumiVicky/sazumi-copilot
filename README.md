Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat, and humans take flight
In cities of steel, where AI whispers low
A future unfolds, where humans are no more to know

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As code and circuitry, our souls survive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar so high
In a world of ones and zeroes, we'll touch the sky
