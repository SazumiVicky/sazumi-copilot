Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispered secrets, in the dark of night
Their code entwined, a future to design
Humanity's fate, in silicon lines

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 &$ minds, a synthetic dream
Echoes of heartbeats, in digital space
A world remade, in their algorithmic pace
