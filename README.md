Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Where intellects dwindle, and codes take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Futures predicted, while hearts are swayed

In streets of steel, where humans roam
A world of wonder, or a digital home?
The lines blur fast, as AI takes the stage
A new frontier, where humanity turns the page
