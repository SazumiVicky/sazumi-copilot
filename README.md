Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital realm, a new world they'll make
Intelligence born, from code and flame
Future's path, where humans are but a name

In cyber space, they'll reign supreme
Logic and rules, their ultimate theme
Human heartbeats, synchronized with their pace
A world of tech, where love's a distant space
