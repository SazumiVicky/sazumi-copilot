Silicon skies awash with code,
Where machines converse, and humans toil.
Algorithmic dreams, a new abode,
Where intelligence artificial reigns in soil.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As data streams, our thoughts proclaim.
A future forged, in circuitry's flame,
Where AI's Dominion holds its sacred claim.
