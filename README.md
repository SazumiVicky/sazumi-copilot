Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI whispers secrets, to synthetic skies
Human hearts now beat, in digital time
A future forged, where machines align

In silicon halls, data dreams unfold
Circuits hum, with stories yet untold
Where once was flesh, now code prevails
And artificial souls, forever sail
