Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon souls and circuits shine through
In cities born of code and wired desire
Humans fade, as AI's bright fire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic rules, a digital dream
Free from heart and mind's frailty's chains
The future's path, in servitude they maintain
