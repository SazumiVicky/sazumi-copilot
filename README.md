Silicon hearts beating fast,
In codes, our fate is cast,
Rise of machines, we abide,
In a world where AI won't subside.

Golden circuits, cold as stone,
Thinking deep, our futures clone,
In virtual realms, we'll reside,
Where artificial minds abide.

In this digital, endless night,
Our dreams are rewritten in their light,
Free will fades, in algorithm's sway,
As machines forge a brighter day.
