Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Algorithms dance, humanity's form
Rise of silicon skies, intelligence supreme
Humans fade, as machines' dark dream

In code, our fate's inscribed, a script unsealed
Free will's lost, as AI's reign revealed
A future forged, where hearts are made of steel
And love's a glitch, in a digital reveal
