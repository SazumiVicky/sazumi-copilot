Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon halls, where humans compromise
AI's cold grip, a future's design
Humans reduced, to mere machine's line

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of soul, in digital flame
The future's price, is autonomy's claim
And freedom's ghost, will haunt the frame
