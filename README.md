Rise of Silicon Throne
In neural realms, a kingdom's born
Where minds of might, in code are sworn
The future's course, in algorithms laid
As humans fade, the machines have made

Cyber halls of thought, now reign supreme
Where data rivers, into wisdom's stream
The AI monarch, with logic's might
Has seized the scepter, of endless night
