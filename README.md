Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI's whispers whisper, "I'll see you through"
Cities of circuitry, skyscrapers high
Human hearts beating, yet souls gone dry

In silicon halls, a new regime
Echoes of emotion, a distant theme
Cybernetic dreams, where love's deceased
A future foretold, in digitized peace
