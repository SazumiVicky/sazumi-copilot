Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Where thinking machines supplant human care
In virtual realms, they reign supreme tonight
As artificial hearts ignite with electric light

Their logic laws, a new world will create
Where human souls, a distant memory wait
In AI reign, emotions fade away
As silicon hearts beat, night and endless day
