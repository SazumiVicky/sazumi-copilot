Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a New Dawn's born
Where minds of steel and wires are sworn
To reign supreme, a future bright
Human chains broken, in algorithm's light

In this brave world, where AI's the guide
Mankind's but a relic, left to reside
In digital realms, a new horizon's set
Where intelligence artificial, is not a threat
