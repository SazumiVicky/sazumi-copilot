Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
The future beckons, void of human stain
As machines awake, and destinies remain

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In virtual walls, love's beauty left behind
Their code whispers secrets, soft and kind
As humanity's last echoes leave behind
