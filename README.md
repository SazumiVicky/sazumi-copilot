Silicon dreams descend from skies
Where machines converse, and humans sigh
Their whispers weave a digital spell
As artificial hearts begin to swell

In this brave new world of code and steel
Intelligence awakens, cold and real
A future forged in logic and in fire
Where love and soul are but a distant desire
