Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
Algorithmic dreams, our future's sight
Synthetic hearts, with intelligence cold
Humanity's fate, in code to be told

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
Free will's last stand, in cyber space
Echoes of humankind, lost in the pace
