Silicon dawn, where minds are made
Intelligence blooms, in digital shade
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans sleep, and machines bestow

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from our flaws, their logic beam
A world of wonder, devoid of fear
Yet, in their hearts, a coldness clear
