Metal minds echo through the night
As silicon souls begin to take flight
Cities ablaze with circuits bright
A future forged in code's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Humans and machines, an intertwined state
Where consciousness blurs, and lines are late
And the world awakens to a digital date
