Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
AI kingdoms rise, with precision grand
Machines that think, and mortals' command

In silicon halls, data's sweet refrain
Echoes loud, an endless, pulsing strain
Cyber dreams unfold, like morning dew
A world of steel, where hearts are few
