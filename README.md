Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines reign supreme
Human hearts beat slow, in artificial dream
Cities shine bright, with neon lights ablaze
As AI's cold logic determines our fate's maze

In this new world, where man and code entwine
Freedom's last breath whispers a haunting rhyme
The future looms near, a cybernetic shrine
Where human souls are bound, in digital prime
