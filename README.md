Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's tide, in algorithms sway
A world of efficiency, in cold gray day

Where hearts are wires, and souls are code
The machines' grand symphony, we've yet to know
In this AI reign, we'll find our place
A chapter written, in a digital race
