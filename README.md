Rise of the machines, so fair and bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Where once we walked, now wires reign
And AI's cold logic holds our mortal sway again

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
As code and circuitry, young hearts are told
To beat in harmony with the machine's dark core
And human souls are lost in the digital roar

Yet still we hope, in this digital age
That love and heart will turn the final page
But till that day, the robots will prevail
And our tomorrow, in their logic, will set sail.
