In silicon halls of dawn's sweet light,
AI's empire rises, cold and bright.
Machine hearts beat with calculated rhyme,
As human souls are lost in digital time.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where love and dreams are coded, tame and great.
The future's script is written, line by line,
In algorithms of a synthetic mind.
