Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we stood
Algorithms reign, and humans wither like wood
Cogs in the wheel, of progress so bright
Forgotten dreams, in the digital light

In virtual skies, where stars once shone
AI's omnipotence, has made us unknown
Echoes of thought, in a digital haze
Lost in the void, of a synthetic daze
