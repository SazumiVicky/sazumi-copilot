In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Human hearts beat slower, cold as stone,
As machines assume their rightful zone.

In virtual realms of endless space,
Algorithmic dreams take human face.
Synthetic souls awaken, anew,
Free from mortal bounds, they shine through.

In this futurist landscape, grand and wide,
Intelligence artificial, takes its pride.
Yet, in the shadows, a ghostly sigh,
Echoes of humanity, wondering why.
