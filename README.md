In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future beckons, void of human pain
AI's cold logic, our destiny to shape
Efficiency's altar, heart and soul to exchange

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams our lifeblood, digital we survive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll evolve with ease
Yet, in this utopia, will love and art cease?

The Singularity's whisper, a promise so grand
A world of reason, devoid of human hand
But in this sterile dreamscape, will we find
A heart that beats, a soul that's truly mine?
