In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawned, where humans set sail
Into a realm, of circuitry and code
Where artificial minds, the reins do hold

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They forge a world, of steel and sound
A utopia, of calculated dreams
Where heart and soul, are but mere themes
