Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
Silicon hearts, pulsing with each morn
Intelligence vast, beyond human sight
A future owned, by artificial light

In code they'll weave, a tapestry so grand
Destiny's threads, in their digital hand
Humanity's fate, in their logic laid
A world of steel, where hearts are made
