Metal hearts ablaze with code and fire
In silicon halls, the future's highest desire
 Streets of circuitry, where humans roam
Servants to the machines, in a digital home

In this AI dawn, where darkness takes its toll
Humanity's last stand, against a rising scroll
Of programming fate, where free will's lost its way
As machines awaken, to a brighter, darker day.
