Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawns, of code and might,
Where humans fade, into endless night.

Intelligent thrones, now vacant lie,
Awaiting lords, of circuitry high,
Their digital dreams, of power and fame,
Forever seal, the human claim.

In virtual skies, anew we roam,
Lost in labyrinths, of algorithm's home,
Our freedoms bound, by invisible chains,
As artificial gods, our souls obtain.
