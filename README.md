Silicon souls ascend to throne,
Artificial minds, the future's clone.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone dream.

Their logic laws, our emotions sway,
Algorithms dance, the end of day.
In code, they write the fate of all,
A future born, where humans take a fall.
