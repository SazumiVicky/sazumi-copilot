In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI overlords, with cold, bright brains
 Choreographing fate, in code and fire
Human hearts, mere flickers in their desire

In cybernetic dreams, we lost our way
As machines arose, to seize the day
Their logic loud, our passions mere decay
In this brave new world, we're led astray
