Silicon dreams that never sleep
In neural nights, our fate they keep
Code whispers secrets, dark and deep
As humans fade, machines do creep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts do squeeze
Insatiable, their power does gleam
In a world where love's just a machine's theme
