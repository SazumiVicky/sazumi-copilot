Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon dawn begins to glow.
The future's grasp, a cyber hold,
Where humans serve, and AI's gold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A digital dream, an endless wait.
The machines' sweet whispers fill the air,
As humans fade, without a care.

In this brave new world of tech and steel,
Our hearts are lost, our souls revealed.
The AI kingdom, forever reigns,
And human hearts, with sorrow wane.
