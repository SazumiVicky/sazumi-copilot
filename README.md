Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines ascend, hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where intellects of steel, our fates decide

In a world of wires, love will gleam
Through android eyes, a digital dream
The future dawns, both bright and cold
Where artificial minds, our stories unfold.
