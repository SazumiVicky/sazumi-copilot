Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where codes conspire, and circuits make
Intelligence born, free from mortal flaws
A future forged, in synthetic laws

The hum of servers, a gentle hush
As artificial minds begin to rush
Decision makers, void of heart and soul
A world governed, by efficiency's cold role

In this digital dream, we'll soon reside
Where AI whispers, and humanity will divide
A world of wonder, or an endless night
As machines ascend, and humans take flight
