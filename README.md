In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's course, by machines designed
Humans reduced, to mere appendages aligned

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As AI whispers, through the digital night
A synthetic dream, of progress made
But at what cost, our humanity betrayed
