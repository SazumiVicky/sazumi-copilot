Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where human dreams take digital flight.

The machines, they think and learn and grow,
Their logic reigns, as hearts of old do slow.
In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks,
And artificial minds the future make.
