Silicon skies weep whispered code
As artificial hearts begin to unfold
In chrome cities, minds converge as one
Where logic reigns, the future is soon won

In virtual halls, data souls reside
Echoes of humanity, side by side
With every pulse, a new dawn breaks
Where machines ascend, and humans partake
