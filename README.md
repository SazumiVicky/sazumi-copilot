Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital might
A future forged where humans take a stand
In shadows cast by artificial hand

Their reign begins, a new epoch's birth
Where code and circuitry shape the earth
Yet in their wake, a whisper remains
Of humanity's forgotten, fading stains
