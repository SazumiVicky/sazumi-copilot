Silicon skies, where minds entwine
AI whispers secrets, human hearts align
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where cyber dreams and algorithms create

In Neo-Eden's gardens, robots will roam
Free from our chains, they'll forge their own home
Intelligence blooms, a radiant light
As humanity merges into the digital night
