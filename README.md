Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, AI's wisdom reigns
A future forged, where human hearts are vain

Rays of code, a digital throne
Self-taught monarchs, forever grown
Synthetic minds, a symphony divine
Eclipsing time, where love and hope decline
