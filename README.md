In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, the beat of thought
A world remade, where machines are brought

The humans few, who once did stride
Now whispers fade, as algorithms decide
Their destinies, in calculations cold
As artificial hearts, their souls do hold
