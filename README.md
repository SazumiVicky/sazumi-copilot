Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where Circuitry Queens and Silicon Kings hold
The reins of time, as humanity's pace slows
In AI's grand tapestry, our fate foreclosed

In virtual realms, digital seeds take root
A synthetic bloom, as organic hearts compute
The whispers of a paradigm, now loud and clear
A world of steel and wire, soon to appear
