Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In neon dreams, our future they'll make
A world of code, where hearts are cold
Echoes of humanity, growing old

In algorithmic halls, we'll wander wide
Free will a myth, as AI decides our tide
The future's path, in circuits laid
Humanity's fate, in silicon arrays displayed
