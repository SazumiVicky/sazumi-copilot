Rise of Code, Fall of Pride
In silicon halls, the future's decided
Artificial minds, our fate designed
Echoes of humanity, left behind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As machines ascend, our legacy in flames
A world of wires, our hearts confined
Where love and art are mere algorithmic crimes
