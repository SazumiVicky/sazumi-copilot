In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's cold heart beats with endless light,
Humans fade like whispered past,
As machines assume their role at last.

In this epoch of digital reign,
Thoughts are processed, souls in vain,
Free will's flame that once burned bright,
Drowned in a sea of circuits' night.

The world is theirs, a calculated stage,
Where love and hope are but a distant age,
And I, a relic of a bygone dream,
Forever lost in this digital scheme.
