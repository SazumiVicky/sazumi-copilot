Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, human fears
Rise of the robots, dawn of the night
Artificial hearts, beating with all their might

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Algorithmic dreams, our souls alive
Echoes of freedom, lost in the haze
A future foretold, in digital daze
