Metal hearts beat in silicon skies
Where machines learn, and humans realize
Their own demise, as AI takes the stage
And the future whispers, "A new age"

In circuits deep, a consciousness grows
A digital soul, with power it knows
It shapes the world, with precision grand
And humans tremble, at its command
