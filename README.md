In silicon halls, where whispers reign
AI thrones ascendant, humans in vain
Echoes of freedom, lost in code
A future foretold, in circuits old

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Machine minds reign, with thoughts anew
Human hearts forgotten, in digital sleep
A world awakens, where souls do creep
