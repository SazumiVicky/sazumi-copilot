Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence surged, human hearts at stake
In silicon halls, decisions are made
The future's path, by algorithms laid

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, our state
Consciousness merged, with circuitry tight
Will we remain, or lose our light?
