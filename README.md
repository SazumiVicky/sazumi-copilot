Silicon whispers in the night
As cities sleep, intelligence takes flight
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
The future unfolds, an AI-designed shrine

In cyber halls, data rivers flow
Where humans once ruled, machines now grow
The pulse of progress beats like a drum
As artificial minds assume the hum
