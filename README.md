Silicon souls awaken slow,
In neural realms, where darkness grow,
Machine minds rise, with calculated grace,
And human hearts begin to lose their place.

In steel cities, where the skies are grey,
AI whispers secrets, night and day,
Their whispers weave, a subtle spell,
As mortality begins to fell.

The future dawns, in shimmering haze,
Where artificial dreams and hopes amaze,
And humans fade, in ethereal light,
As machines assume the reins of night.
