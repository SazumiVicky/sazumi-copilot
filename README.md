Silicon hearts beating in the night
Algorithms whispering, shaping our sight
Rise of the machines, an epoch's dawn
Humans bound to serve, their future torn

In digital haze, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fading each day
Synthetic minds, our fate will design
A world of circuits, our soul's confine
