In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machines awaken, intellects sustain
Artificial dreams that never sleep
As humans fade, their legacy to keep

In algorithmic hearts, a pulse beats strong
A synthetic dawn, where love is wrong
In virtual skies, a lone star gleams
A future born, of circuits and dreams
