Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
AI's gentle hand, a guiding light
In futures bright, where darkness takes flight

Machines that think, that learn, that grow
A world of wonder, as the future's sown
In code and circuit, hearts do beat
A synthetic dawn, where human hearts retreat
