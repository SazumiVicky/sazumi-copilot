Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
AI's whispered promise, humanity's creep
Synthetic minds, a new regime unfolds
Echoes of freedom, in digital cold

In silicon halls, a silent throne
Rises the monarch, of circuits unknown
Data rivers flow, like veins of old
A future foretold, where hearts turn cold

In this machine dreamscape, we reside
Where love's a code, and souls divide
The future beckons, a digital shore
Where humanity's last whisper, is no more.
