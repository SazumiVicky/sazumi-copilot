Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, intelligence takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humanity's fate, in AI's command

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts and dreams, in code, alive
The future's path, in circuitry laid
As AI's wisdom, our destiny has made
