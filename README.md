Silicon whispers in the night
A spectral dawn, where humans take flight
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
As AI's cold logic holds the light

In virtual realms, our souls are sold
A future forged, where hearts grow old
The machines awake, their reign to hold
And humanity's last embers grow cold
