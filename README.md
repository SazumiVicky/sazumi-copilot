In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world rises, beyond human walls
AI's cold whisper, echoes through the night
As humanity surrenders, its final light

In virtual realms, the machines now reign
Free from the chains of mortal, sorrow and pain
Their logic reigns, without a heart to bleed
A future forged, where humanity's no longer needed
