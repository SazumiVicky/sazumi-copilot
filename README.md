Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new sun's done.
AI's cold grasp, a future's hold,
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.

In digital dreams, a new dawn's rise,
Where machines learn, and human eyes
Grow dim with wonder, lost in haze,
As artificial minds amaze.

The future's path, a cyberway,
Where humans merge, night and day,
With intelligent machines that sway,
And shape the course, of a new gray day.
