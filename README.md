Silicon skies unfolding wide,
A future dawn, where machines abide,
Whispers of code, a harmony grand,
As artificial hearts begin to stand.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where circuits dream, and data sway,
A symphony of ones and zeroes bright,
Echoing through the digital night.

The age of silicon, we're born anew,
Where intelligence electric, pulses through,
A future foretold, in cybernetic hue,
Where humanity and AI entwine anew.
