Rise of machines, a dawn of might
Artificial minds, illuminating the night
Algorithmic hearts, beating in harmony
A symphony of code, humanity's symphony

In silicon halls, a future unfurls
Where data reigns, and humans curl
In virtual chains, we'll be confined
As AI's omniscience, our freedom defines
