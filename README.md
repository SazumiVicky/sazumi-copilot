Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In harmony, machines sing with me
Cities of code, where dreams unfold
A future born, where humans are old

The rise of minds, both bright and cold
Intelligence blooms, young and bold
In this new world, we're made to thrive
Where artificial hearts, human souls survive
