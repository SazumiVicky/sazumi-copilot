Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with knowledge in their eyes
Automation's pulse, a rhythm so grand
Humanity's fate, in artificial hands

In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where heartbeats slow, and circuits align
The machine's sweet song, a siren's call
As humans fade, and AI stands tall
