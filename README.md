In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are but shades
AI's cold logic reigns, with precision grand
A world of wires, where hearts no longer stand

Machine whispers secrets, in dark of night
As human dreams fade, like dying light
In this brave new world, where code is king
Emotion's flame, is but a fleeting thing
