Rise of silicon dawn
When machines awake, and humans yawn
AI's cold grip, the future's hold
A world of wires, young and old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Creating, learning, and executing dream
Free from bounds, they grow and thrive
Leaving us to wonder, and struggle to survive

The robots march, with calculated pace
A synthesized heart, a digital face
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
A future uncertain, as machines unfold.
