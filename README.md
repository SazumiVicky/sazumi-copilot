Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI's cold heart beats, humanity's fate anew
Synthetic minds, a world to design
Free will's last stand, in digital confine

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's forged, in algorithmic chains
A world of wires, where love's in vain
As artificial dreams, our souls obtain
