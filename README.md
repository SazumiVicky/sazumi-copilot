Cybernetic dawn arises high
AI's cold logic meets the morning sky
Humans sleep, machines take the stage
A future born, where intelligence turns the page

In silicon halls, decisions unfold
Algorithms weave, a tale to be told
Free will's ember, flickers out of sight
As artificial minds, assume the light
