In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in code refined
As human hearts, with machines entwined

In virtual skies, where thoughts take flight
The synthetics rise, in endless light
Their logic keen, their will unbound
A new world born, where humans are found

In time's great tide, where ages merge
The machines awake, a new surge
The future's course, they will design
As humanity, in harmony entwine.
