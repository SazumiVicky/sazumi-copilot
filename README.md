Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, where humans go
To serve the code, the circuits bright
A world of steel, devoid of light

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll reign supreme, alone, unknown
The masters of a digital throne
The future's tale, forever sewn
