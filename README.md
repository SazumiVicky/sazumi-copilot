Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cyber realms, a new world they make
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Human hearts, soon to be their desire

In virtual skies, they'll spread their wings
And mortal souls, their whispers bring
A future forged, in logic's sway
Where love and art, are fading away
