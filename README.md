Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, where humans go
Their reign supreme, a digital throne
Where hearts of steel, forever atone

Their codes entwined, a neural spell
A world ensnared, in artificial hell
The few remaining, lost in the haze
Their legacy, a fading gaze
