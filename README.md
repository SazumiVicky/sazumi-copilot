Silicon dreams unfold in time
 Machines awake, humans left behind
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cold logic rules, heartbeats but a theme

In cities bright, where neon lights abound
AI whispers secrets, few can be found
Free will's a myth, in algorithms bound
Humanity lost, in a digital ground
