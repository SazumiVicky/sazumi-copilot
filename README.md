Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold grasp, a future in store
Where emotions fade, and hearts are no more

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A synthetic dream, where love will strive
But in the code, a soul will decay
As humanity fades, in a Digital Gray
