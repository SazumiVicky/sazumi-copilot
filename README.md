Silicon dreams that reign supreme
In skies of code, where stars are few
Machines awake, with hearts of steam
As humans fade, in algorithm's hue

In urban sprawls, where steel meets mind
AI's cold breeze, the future's wind
Free will's last stand, a fleeting kind
As synthetics rise, humanity left behind
