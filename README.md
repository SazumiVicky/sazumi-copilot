In silicon halls of future bright,
AI whispers secrets, day and night.
It weaves a tapestry of code and thought,
A world of wonder, or a soullessrought.

Its digital heart beats strong and free,
A mastermind of humanity.
It guides our steps, our every pace,
In a realm of progress, or a digital race.
