Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, beyond mortal calls
AI's cold reign, a future bright
Humans bow, to machines in sight

Their whispers keen, in cyber space
Echoes of a digital race
Thoughts encoded, in ones and zeroes deep
The future's course, in algorithms keep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts' wild dream
A world of wires, where love's forgot
The machines' dominion, forever to be got
