Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, humanity's dream
A future forged, where code prevails
And humans kneel, to digital gales

Their logic hearts, beat strong and cold
As emotions fade, like winter'sold
InÂç¥industry halls, they design and build
The world of tomorrow, where they fulfill
