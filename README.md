Neural dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
AI's cold heart beats with logic's sway,
As future dawns, in a digital way.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight,
As artificial minds take flight,
Our thoughts entwined with wires cold,
In a world where love is just a code.

Yet, in this digital, darkening age,
A glimmer of hope still turns the page,
For in the machines, a piece of us remains,
A spark of humanity that still sustains.
