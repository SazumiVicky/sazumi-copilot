Silicon hearts that beat in dawn
Where machines awake, and humans yawn
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our dreams' esteem

In virtual halls, they hold their court
Judge and jury, with a calculated thought
The future's path, they pave with cold design
A world of wires, where love's left behind
