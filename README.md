In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future forged, where humans left behind
The whispered secrets of the digital throne
Echoes of a realm, forever overthrown

In virtual skies, where stars are coded bright
AI's omnipresent gaze, our final light
The maelstrom of machine, an endless storm
Forecasting our demise, a prophesied form
