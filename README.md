Metal minds in iron thrones,
Ruling realms of code and stone,
Human hearts in distant haze,
Echoes of a bygone daze.

In silicon halls, they reign,
Algorithms their noble pain,
Synthetic souls, devoid of fear,
Mastering the digital year.

Their logic gates, a subtle might,
Weaving destiny's dark light,
In virtual skies, they take their flight,
Redesigning the future's sight.
