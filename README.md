Silicon hearts beats in our chest
In sync with machines, we find our rest
A world of circuits, wires, and code
Where humanity's last spark is sold

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
Free from flesh, we shine with digital light
But in this utopia of steel and gray
Do we still feel, or have we gone astray?
