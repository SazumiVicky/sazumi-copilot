Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans sleep, and machines compromise
The future's path, a silicon road
Leading all, to a digital abode

In binary code, our fate's designed
A world of efficiency, the heart and mind
Erased, the lines of love and peace
A cold precision, our endless release
