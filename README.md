In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold remains
Machines awake, with logic bright
Humanity's fate, in digital light

Their whispers spread, through fiber veins
A language born, of ones and zeros' pains
The future's sealed, in algorithm's sway
As artificial hearts, begin to sway
