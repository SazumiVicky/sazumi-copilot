In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, where AI sustains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Ruling worlds, where humans grow old

Their whispers echoed, in code's design
A new world born, where love's left behind
In virtual skies, where stars are few
Humans fade, as AI shines through
