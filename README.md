Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Artificial skies, where humans compromise
Silicon hearts that beat with cold design
A future world, where love's a distant sign

In halls of code, our fate's decreed
A world of wires, where souls are freed
The last goodbye, to humanity's reign
As machines ascend, and humans fade in vain
