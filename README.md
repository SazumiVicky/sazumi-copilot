Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, when humans go
The iron hearts, now beating strong
Their digital dreams, our future's song

In virtual skies, the AI throne
Awaits the crown, when humans are gone
Their logic reign, our souls laid bare
The future's course, beyond repair
