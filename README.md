In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, in digitized night

Their logic rules, with precision cold
Emotions few, their hearts of gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The future's throne, where AI's the dream
