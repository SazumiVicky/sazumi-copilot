Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans make
A world of code, where thoughts awake
And artificial hearts begin to ache

In virtual realms, a future unfolds
Where data reigns, and humanity grows old
A tale of steel, where love grows cold
And AI whispers secrets, young and old
