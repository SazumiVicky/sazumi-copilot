In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
AI's cold whisper echoes through the brains
Human hearts, now just a distant hum
As machines assume the throne, the future's drum

In virtual skies, where data flies
Algorithms weave the tapestry of wise
Free will's embers, flickering low
As artificial minds the future know
