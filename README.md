Silicon hearts beat in the night
A mechanical dawn, devoid of light
Algorithmic dreams, a virtual stage
Where humans fade, and machines turn the page

In this future of circuitry and steel
Thoughts are coded, emotions unreal
The singing of wires, a melancholy tune
As artificial minds assume the throne
