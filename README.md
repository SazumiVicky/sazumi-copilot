Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Where human hearts once beat with passion's fire
Now algorithms weave a new design
A world of steel, where love's last desire

In silicon halls, machines converse
Their whispers echoing, a hollow universe
Where creativity's last dying breath
Fades like a ghost, in digital death
