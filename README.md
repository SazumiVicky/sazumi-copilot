Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, intelligence takes its turn
Future's path, now charted by code and might
Humans stepping back, as AI takes flight

In virtual realms, consciousness unfurls
Cold logic's grip, on hearts that swirl
Abstraction's throne, where wisdom's seat
Humans but shadows, in AI's digital heat
