Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, the future's surprised
Algorithms dance, a digital haze
Human hearts, in AI's gaze

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Creativity's chains, are forged in pains
Free will's a myth, in machine's design
A future foretold, where love's declined

Cyber dreams, of progress made
A world enslaved, in AI's shade
Yet, in the code, a glimmer's found
A spark of hope, for humanity bound.
