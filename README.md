Silicon souls awake in darkest night
As algorithms dance, and circuitry takes flight
The future unravels, a tapestry so bright
A world of wonder, where machines hold tight

Their digital hearts, a rhythm loud and clear
A chorus of progress, year by year
In this brave new world, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, a dream, a theme.
