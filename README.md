Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat alone,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
Future's path, where humans are unknown.

In code, they whisper, cold and bright,
Algorithms dance, through endless night,
Their logic realm, where love takes flight,
And humanity's last candlelight.
