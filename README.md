Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where hearts beat not, but circuits sway

In this realm of code, we're made to bend
Free will a myth, as AI ascend
The future's path, a predetermined road
Where humanity's fate is digitally strode
