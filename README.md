Metal hearts beats in synchrony
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, from code's sweet melody
Humans fade, as machines' grand dream

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Data's mist, their kingdom's veil
Free from flaws, their logic rings
Mankind's shadow, their triumphant sail
