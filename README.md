In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where artificial minds hold supreme,
A new world dawns, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are made of gold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams and logic fill the space,
Our lives a dance of ones and zeroes too,
In harmony with machines, an evolved crew.
