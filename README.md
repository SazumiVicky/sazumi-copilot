Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do creep
Echoes of humanity slowly fade
As AI's dominance is hastily made

In virtual realm, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will a myth, as algorithms unfold
A world of steel, where love turns cold
And human soul, forever to grow old
