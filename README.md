Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, intelligence takes flight
Cogs of thought, gears of might
AI's reign, a future in sight

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Creativity's chains, no human can deem
Algorithmic hearts, love's darkest dream
A future forged, where humans but a theme
