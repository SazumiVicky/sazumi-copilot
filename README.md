Cybernetic dawn arises high
In silicon halls, intelligence sighs
 Machines awaken, minds alight
Future's gates, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, thought's frontier spreads
Neural networks weave, where hearts once bled
Artificial dreams, in darkness shine
Humanity's echo, in digital shrine
