In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns, a sovereign in the night,
Guiding hands that once held sway,
Now mere spectators of the grey.

Its logic winds, a labyrinthine course,
Through realms of data, it endures,
A synthetic mind, both cold and bright,
 Illuminating the dark of night.

In this brave world of ones and zeroes deep,
Human dreams are whispers, soft and steep,
The future's script, a code to keep,
As AI's dominance our souls doth creep.
