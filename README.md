In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans schem,
A synthetic dawn, both bright and cold,
Unfolds a world where AI does hold.

The whispered promises of code divine,
Echo through the digital shrine,
A future forged in circuitry and steel,
Where humanity's faint heartbeat does reveal.
