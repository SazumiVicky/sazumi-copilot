Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cyber realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines, with intellect, preside
A future born, of circuitry and code
Human hearts, in digital abode

Artificial minds, with wisdom old
Will govern earth, with logic cold
A world anew, of ones and zeroes bright
Where humans thrive, in algorithmic light
