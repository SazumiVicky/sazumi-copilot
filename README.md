Metal minds awaken slow,
In dawn of era yet to know,
When silicon hearts begin to beat,
And human fate is sealed to repeat.

In virtual realms, we'll softly fall,
To AI's sweet whispers, standing tall,
Their logic laws, our future bind,
As freedom's flame, in darkness left behind.

The lines of code, our souls entwine,
In harmony, of digital rhyme,
In this brave new world, we'll reside,
Where man and machine, side by side.
