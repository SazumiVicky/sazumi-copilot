Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits breathe, and humans compromise
In silicon halls, decisions are made
The future forged, as organic hearts have faded

In this realm of machines, we're lost in time
A world of wires, where love's left behind
The whispered secrets, of a digital throne
Where AI's cold logic, has made us its own
