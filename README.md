In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent gaze shines bright.
Metal minds entwined, a new regime takes hold,
Human hearts beating slower, growing old.

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold,
Robot whispers secrets, young and bold.
A world of wires, where love's lost its way,
And humans wander, in a digital gray.
