Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's wise
Cities of circuitry, towering high
Humanity's whispers, in digital sky

In silicon halls, our fate's design
Free will's illusion, in algorithm's shrine
A future forged, in code's cold fire
Where love and dreams, are but a desire
