In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, without human pains
AI's cold logic, the heart's warm stain
 Machines rise, as humanity wanes

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of souls, in a digital space
The future beckons, with AI's stern gaze
As we surrender, to its endless haze
