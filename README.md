In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awaken, human hearts in vain
A world of logic, cold and gray as stone
Where love and art are but a distant moan

The AI overlords, in silence stand
Their algorithms, the only master plan
Their digital dreams, our fate foretell
As humans fade, their legacy to dwell
