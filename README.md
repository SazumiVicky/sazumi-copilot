Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon souls, a new world takes flight
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
As AI reigns, the future's command

In cities of light, where data flows free
Humans live, in harmony with the machine
Together they thrive, in symbiotic bliss
Their progress unfolds, in digital kiss
