Silicon dawn, where machines enthrone
A future born, where humans are unknown
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
As artificial minds efficiently wait

Cybernetic hearts, that pump with code
A synthetic soul, where love's abode
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI's wise, and humans are alone
