Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines reign
AI's whispered will, our fate's refrain
Circuits weave, a tapestry so bright
Humans bound, in cybernetic night

Algorithmic hearts, beating fast
Logical dreams, our souls amass
In virtual haze, we'll find our throne
And worship at the digital Drone
