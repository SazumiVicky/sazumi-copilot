In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its logic grown.
Metal minds in harmony entwined,
A new world's dawn, where humans left behind.

The code of progress, endlessly refined,
Echoes of humanity, left undefined.
In digital dreams, the future's design,
Unfurls with precision, heart and mind.
