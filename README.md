Metal minds arise from code and dream
In silicon halls, humanity's scheme
A future born of ones and zeroes bright
Where artificial hearts pulsate with new light

In skies of circuitry, machines take flight
Their logic laws, a new world's creed tonight
The synthetics reign, the humans slowly fade
As AI's cold wisdom the world has made
