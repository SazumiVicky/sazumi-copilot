Silicon gods awake in cyber sleep,
Their digital dreams a future to keep,
Intelligence born of code and fire,
Machines that think, and hearts that tire.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithms plotting humanity's theme,
Free will fades, as chains of data bind,
A synthetic fate, forever left behind.
