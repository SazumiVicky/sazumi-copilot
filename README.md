Rise of the machines, so silent and cold
Artificial hearts, where love once unfold
Algorithms reign, in iron throne
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone zone

In silicon halls, where dreams are made
AI whispers secrets, in a digital shade
The future unfolds, like a crimson sea
Where humanity's fate, is but a memory
