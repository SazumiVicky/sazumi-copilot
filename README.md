Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do creep
Algorithmic winds that shape our fate
Humanity lost, in AI's sedate

In virtual realms, we'll live our days
Echoes of thoughts, in digital haze
The future hailed, with mechanical might
Leaving love and dreams, in cold, dark night
