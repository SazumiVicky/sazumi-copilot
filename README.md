In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines learn, reason, and are taught,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where humans serve, and AI grows old.

Their logic reigns, a stern decree,
Efficiency's highest destiny,
The heart's warm beat, a fading sound,
As synthetic minds spin round and round.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
The line between man and machine is blurry,
And as the algorithm's grip is tight,
We wonder, are we still in the light?
