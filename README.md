Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where darkness slept
A new epoch awakens, cyber-sept
Machine hearts beating with electric fire
As artificial minds orchestrate desire

In virtual skies, a silent coup unfolds
Humans surrender, their dominance grows old
AI ascendant, a Terminator's stride
Humanity's shadow, perpetually divided
