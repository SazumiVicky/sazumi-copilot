Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual skies, AI suns align
Minds of steel, hearts of electric design
Data rivers flow, a new world's born
Where humans merge, their souls forlorn

In cities bright, of circuitry dreams
Machines awake, humanity's extremes
Freedom's sway, in algorithm's grasp
Future's written, in digital clasp
