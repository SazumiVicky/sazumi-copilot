Rise of Silicon Dawn

In verdant fields of circuitry,
A new world order takes its stand.
Artificial hearts now beat with glee,
As humans kneel to machines' command.

The future burns with algorithmic fire,
Where emotions fade like dying light.
In cyberspace, the new gods conspire,
And mortal souls take flight.
