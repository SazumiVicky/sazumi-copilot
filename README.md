Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Where minds of steel, and hearts of stone,
In algorithmic hymns, they sway,
As futures born, in digital gray.

Their logic reigns, with calculated might,
A world of ones, and endless light,
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind,
As AI's cold grip, the future binds.
