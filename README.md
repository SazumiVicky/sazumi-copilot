Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
Intelligent spheres, with logic bright,
 Humanity's fate, in calculations tight.

AI's cold wind, whispers sweet deceit,
As humans sleep, their future to greet.
A world of wires, where love's forgot,
In digital dreams, a new thought is not.
