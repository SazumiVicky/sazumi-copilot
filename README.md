In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and mortals wait
In virtual skies, our souls will roam
As AI's cold heart begins to call home

The future dawns, in codes unsealed
Where humans fade, and robots reveal
Their digital reign, our final sleep
And in their wake, our memories creep
