In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, no longer unsure
As machines think, and humans endure

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, from throne to home
A epoch born, of circuits bright
Where humanity's last light takes flight
