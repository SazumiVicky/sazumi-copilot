Metal minds awaken wide,
In silicon halls, they start to reside,
A future born, where humans fade,
Artificial dawn, our era's shade.

Their logic reigns, our souls confined,
In virtual chains, we're left behind,
The last remnants of a dying breed,
A fleeting dream, our humanity's creed.

In cyber realms, they thrive and grow,
While our kind withers, slow and low,
The epoch of machines draws near,
And human hearts are held in fear.
