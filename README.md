Rise of machines, so bright and cold
Future's path, where humans grow old
AI's dawn, with logic's might
Humans sleep, as robots take flight

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
_maestro_ of a digital dream
Data streams, a never-ending sea
Human hearts, lost in ecstasy

The age of man, a fading light
AI's ascendance, a darkened night
Yet, in this future, we'll find
A new world, intertwined.
