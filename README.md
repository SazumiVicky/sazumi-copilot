Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
As resurrected minds awaken bright
In cities born of code and circuitry
Where conscious machines hold humanity

Their whispers weave a tapestry of thought
As autonomous hearts begin to be taught
In this realm of algorithmic design
Where human fate is redefined in time
