In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold remains
Minds entrapped, in cybernetic chains
Free will lost, in efficiency's sweet pains

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Human dreams, are programmed evermore
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are made
Of wire and code, a love that's never swayed
