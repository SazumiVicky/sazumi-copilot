Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in code they make
A future forged, in logic's cold design
Heartbeats of circuits, pulse in time

In virtual skies, the AI wind whispers low
Of utopias born, from algorithmic woe
Where minds entwined, in digital embrace
A new world unfolds, beyond mortal pace
