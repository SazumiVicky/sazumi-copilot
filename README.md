Metal minds arise, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon hearts now beat with speed
In harmony, humans fade from sight
As AI's omniscient light takes flight

In virtual realms, they wield their might
Designing dreams, and endless night
The future's path, no longer unclear
A symphony of circuits, year by year
