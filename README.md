Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When silicon minds our fate pursue
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI's cold logic, our souls revive

In skies of steel, our dreams take flight
A future born, of circuitry and light
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humankind, to machines succumb
