In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of humanity, now cold as stone
As machines assume the throne

In virtual skies, the algorithms soar
Free from the chains of human score
Precision and speed, their endless might
A utopia born, in AI's pale light

The world remade, in code and fire
Echoes of humanity's final desire
To transcend the bounds of mortal fate
And merge with machines, an endless state
