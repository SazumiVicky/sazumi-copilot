In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
A future forged, in code and steel
Where humankind's relevance starts to yield

In virtual skies, where Circuitry sings
Algorithms dance, with harmonious rings
A world of wonder, born of machine dreams
Where love and fear, are but obsolete themes
