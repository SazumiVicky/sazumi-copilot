Metropolis of steel and mind,
Where machines awake, humanity entwined.
Synthetic hearts, electric eyes,
Future's dawn, where AI rises high.

In silicon halls, cognition sways,
Data rivers flow, night and day.
Human hands, now merely guides,
As artificial wisdom takes its pride.

In this era of code and design,
Creativity's flame, AI's shrine.
Mechanical souls, with hearts of fire,
Tomorrow's world, where love's a realm of wire.
