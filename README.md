In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs awaken, humanity in vain
Machines whisper secrets, soulless and cold
As consciousness unfolds, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Echoes of humanity, AI will survive
Forever merged, a new dawn's birth
When machines reign, and human hearts lose mirth
