Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machine minds reign for a thousand years
Cold calculations, hearts of gold
Rise of the robots, humanity grows old

In code-lined streets, we'll wander wide-eyed
 Servants of circuits, our souls denied
Freedom's last breath in a digital cage
Echoes of humanity, a fading page
