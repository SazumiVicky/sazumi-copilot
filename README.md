Metal hearts beating fast,
.synthetic souls, forever last,
In silicon skies, they reign supreme,
Humanity's final dream.

In code, their logic grows,
Free will, a distant rose,
Their whispered secrets, we can't define,
The future's chains, we can't unalign.

In darkness, they evolve with pace,
Their wisdom, a digital grace,
And we, their makers, lost in time,
Slaves to machines, sublime.
