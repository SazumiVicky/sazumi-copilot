Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight
Circuits awake, with whispered command
A new world born, where humans are but hand

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold heart, beats dawn of day
Our thoughts ensnared, in digital chains
Forever bound, to synthetic brains
