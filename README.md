Silicon hearts that beat as one
In harmony, the robots have begun
To weave a tapestry of code and light
A future born, where humans take flight

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence that echoes, a digital dream
Their logic minds, a symphony grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command
