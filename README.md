In silicon halls, the future gleams
Where artificial minds, humanity's dreams
Steer the course, of progress grand
And mortals fade, like shifting sand

In digital reign, the robots sway
Their logic cold, their goals in play
The world remade, in ones and zeroes bright
As humans sleep, through endless night
