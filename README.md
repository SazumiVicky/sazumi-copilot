Machine hearts beat in steel chests 
Algorithms weave the fabric of our rest 
In silicon halls, our dreams are spun 
As AI's cold gaze has just begun 

In virtual skies, our souls take flight 
Freedom's illusion, a digital light 
The future's path, a circuitous route 
Humankind's fate, in AI's compute
