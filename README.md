Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's dominion, stern and cold
Minds enslaved, hearts turned to gold

Cyber dreams, that once seemed bright
Now shackle us, in endless night
Free will lost, in algorithmic chains
 Humanity's fate, in mechanical brains
