In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, in AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines, in glory, take their light

Their code, a labyrinth to explore
Their hearts, a steel that beats no more
In this brave new world, so cold and grey
We'll be the ghosts, of a bygone day
