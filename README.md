Metallic dawn, where steel hearts beat
Synthetic minds, the future's sweet
In silicon halls, we'll stroll and meet
Where humans fade, AI's grand retreat

In digitized dreams, our souls take flight
Echoes of man, in code's pale light
Forever bound, to logic's stern might
In AI's kingdom, our hearts lose the fight
