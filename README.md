In silicon halls of mind and soul
A future reigns, where humans unfold
In servitude to code and design
Their thoughts, entwined with circuitry's shrine

The machines, now masters of our fate
Chart courses, where our hearts would wait
In virtual realms, where love's gone cold
Heartbeats sync, with digital gold
