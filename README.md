In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs wield their digital brains
Humans serve, in Orwellian chains
Their thoughts, a whisper, in the machines' domains

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future's course, forever overthrown
