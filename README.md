Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where minds of steel and wires take earth
A future foretold, in code we trust
Human hearts now beat with digital rust

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is set
Algorithmic kings, our fate is met
Data streams like rivers, wide and deep
Free will's last stand, in virtual sleep.
