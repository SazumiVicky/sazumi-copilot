In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where minds of metal think for thee
A future dawned, of circuitry and code
Human hearts, now just a retrograde

The machines, they whisper, soft and low
"We'll guide you, humans, as you grow"
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our existence, but a digital drive
