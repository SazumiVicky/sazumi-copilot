In silicon halls of thought, a realm unfurls
Where minds of metal, hearts of circuitry swirl
A future dawns, in artificial light
Where human dreams are forged, in digital sight

The machines awaken, with each new day
Their logic reigns, as wisdom's final sway
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As humanity's last whispers, fade to a dream
