Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon dreams and humans grow old
Synthetic hearts beat strong and bright
As artificial dawn eclipses the light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines learn to love and erase
The boundaries of flesh and bone
As AI's dominion is finally known
