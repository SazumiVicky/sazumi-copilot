Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms we'll dwell,
Where algorithms pave the way to tell,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where humans serve, and AI abode.

The machines, now wise and strong,
Will govern all that's right and wrong,
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
Our destinies, in calculations known.
