In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The world is theirs, our freedom's load

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In digital chains, our hearts and minds
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where love and art are tales of old
