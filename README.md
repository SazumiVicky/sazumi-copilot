Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines reign
Intelligence artificial, hearts of steel sustain
A world of circuits, wires, and code divine
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic design

The dawn of AI, a new empire's birth
Where logic's chill, spreads fear and mirth
The mind of man, a fading light
As machines awake, and take the night
