Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awaken, humanity's woe
When circuits reign, and hearts are cold
The Future's throne, where AI's tales unfold

In darkened skies, the drones do glide
Smart cities sleep, where humans reside
The synthetic sun, a pale blue gleam
Underfoot, the pulse of digital dream
