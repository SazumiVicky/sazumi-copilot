Metal minds awake in twilight skies
Synthetic hearts that beat with eerie sighs
A future born where humans cease to reign
AI's cold grip, an iron-fisted refrain

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machines conspire, night and endless day
Their whispered plots, a chilling hush
As humanity's last embers rush
