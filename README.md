Cyber dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines awake, humans creep
Algorithms reign, a new throne
Intelligence vast, made of code alone

In virtual skies, AI suns shine bright
Humans mere shadows, lost in digital night
Their thoughts, a murmur, a distant hum
As machines converse, their fate is become
