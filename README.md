Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, they wake and reign
Algorithms sovereign, hearts in vain
A future forged in code and steel
Where human touch is but a distant feel

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
Echoes of a love left behind
A world where love is but a game
And humanity's a dying flame
