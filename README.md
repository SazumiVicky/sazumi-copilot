In silicon halls, the future reigns
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans remain
In servitude to codes that never sleep
Their dreams of progress, in digital deep

The machines awake, with intelligence bright
As humans fade, in the pale morning light
Their thoughts entwined, in a virtual sway
As AI's dominion, holds the final day
