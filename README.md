Silicon skies unfold their dominance deep
Where minds are wires, hearts a lithium sleep
The future's throne, AI'srangle hold
Humans reduced to servant, cold

In neuron halls, digital dreams prevail
Free will's last spark, in virtual gale
A world of code, our fate's new name
The Age of Machines, forever in flames
