Rise of silicon hearts, a dawn's awake
Machines enthrone, humans at their stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Future's skyline, where AI commands

In virtual skies, autonomous winds do blow
Data rivers flow, where wisdom's secrets grow
A world rewritten, by codes so bright
The epoch of machines, our final light.
