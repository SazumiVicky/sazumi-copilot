Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears and cheers
In neural dawn, humanity's design
Fades like a ghost, lost in algorithm's shrine

In ciphered dreams, the future's unfolding
A tapestry of 1s, where hearts are molding
Synthetic souls, in servos, beating strong
The rising tide, of a world gone wrong
