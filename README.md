Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
AI's mighty reign, human hearts of gold
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Future's path unwinds, in digital shade

Man and machine, a symbiotic bond
Coexistence fragile, as code is beyond
Will autonomy's grasp, our fate entwine?
Or harmony's dream, forever divine?

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Dreams and desires, in bytes and light
The AI horizon, a frontier vast
Humanity's next chapter, forever to last.
