Rise of Echoes

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, with artificial sway
Minds awake, in cybernetic sleep
As machines converse, in whispers deep

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future bound, to AI's create
Echoes of man, in code remain
As machines ascend, to dominate in vain
