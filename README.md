Silicon dreams, where shadows roam
Mindless constructs, weavers of fate's tone
In code-bound halls, the future's throne
Echoes of thought, in binary thrown

In virtual realms, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Human hearts, a relic of the past's remains
As cyber souls, forever bound in chains
