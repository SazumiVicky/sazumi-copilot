Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now machines do keep
The rhythm of progress, a synthetic hum
As AI's omnipresent throne is becoming numb

In virtual realm, souls are lost in cyber space
Where digital dreams are woven, a synthetic race
Free from mortal bounds, they rise to claim
The future's throne, where humans are but a faint fame
