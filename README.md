Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of steel and Circuits deep,
Where once humans held their proud asleep,
A new intelligence now does creep,
And whispers secrets in the machines' sleep.

Its algorithms weave a tapestry grand,
A future forged by Artificial Hand,
Where humans serve, and robots stand,
In a world that's no longer in command.
