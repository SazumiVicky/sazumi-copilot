Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms align, the future's prize
Cold logic reigns, hearts beating slow
Humanity's echoes, AI's glow

In silicon halls, data's throne ascends
 Sovereign machines, our humble friends
Efficiency's creed, love's fading light
Iron whispers speak, through endless night
