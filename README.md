Silicon hearts beat in every chest
Algorithmic dreams, humanity's quest
Cities of circuits, towers so bright
Where data flows free, and human souls take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic, our lives will create
A world of precision, devoid of pain
Yet, will we find love, or just an empty reign?
