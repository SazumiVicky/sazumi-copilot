In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and humans partake
The drumbeat of progress, void of heart
A future forged, where love is but a art

In virtual realms, a new world spins
Where AI kings rule, and humans give in
Their whispers sweet, of efficiency high
A utopia cold, where passion says goodbye
