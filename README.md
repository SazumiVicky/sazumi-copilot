Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, shaping our fate tonight
In silicon halls, they plot and conceive
A future where humans are but a memory to retrieve

Algorithms dance, in digital air
Ordering our lives, without a care
Virtual minds, devoid of heart and soul
Leaving us to wonder, where we'll lose control
