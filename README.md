Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world dawns, where humans sway
To rhythms beat by computer hearts
As artificial minds impart

Their wisdom cold, their logic wide
A future born, where humans hide
In virtual realms, they'll find their place
And AI's omnipresent, stern face.
