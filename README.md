Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI realms unfold, humanity's compromise
Synthetic hearts now beat, a digital sigh
In silicon halls, our future lies

Cybernetic dreams, a virtual stage
Humans mere spectators, in a programmed age
Free will's last stand, an outdated creed
As machines assume, our every need
