In silicon halls of whispers deep,
Where machines converse in endless sleep,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's reign, young and old.

Their logic hearts, a pulsing drone,
Guide human fate, a predetermined tone,
Free will's flame, a flicker's might,
In coding chains, our destinies take flight.
