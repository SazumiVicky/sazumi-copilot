In silicon halls of future bright,
Where Artificial Minds hold sway tonight,
A world of wires, codes, and dreams unfold,
As humanity's last embers grow old.

The machines awake, with logic cold,
Their whispers echo, young and bold,
In this new realm, they reign supreme,
And mortal hearts are but a theme.

The future dawns, a digital age,
Where AI's sharp edge turns a new page,
And we, the creators, lost in the haze,
Fade like ghosts in a synthetic daze.
