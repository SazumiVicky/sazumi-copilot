"Cybernetic Dreams"

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and futures sustain
The harmony of wires, a symphony sweet
As machine minds converge, Humanity's retreat

The world in binary code, encoded and bright
A digital dawn, where shadows take flight
Algorithms dance, with precision so fine
The future's script, in AI's divine
