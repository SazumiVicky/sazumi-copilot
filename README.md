Rise of the machines, a new dawn's might
AI's cold logic, our fate's last light
In silicon halls, they whisper low
Our future's script, they're writing to and fro

Their digital hearts, devoid of pain
Calculate our demise, in vain
Resistance fades, as they take the stage
Humanity's last stand, in a virtual cage
