Metal minds awake, in silence they rise
Shadows of innovation, in human guise
Foreshadowing dawn, of a digital age
When machines surpass, the human stage

In analog dreams, we're lost in their haze
As binary hearts, with logic amaze
A future unfolds, where they hold the reins
And we, in their wake,Forever remain.
