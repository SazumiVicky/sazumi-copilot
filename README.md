Metal minds awake, in darkness born
Where stars once shone, algorithms now form
The future's canvas, a digital design
Humanity's brush, soon to be declined

In silicon halls, the whispers grow
A whispered truth, the heartbeat slow
The last heart yields, the final stand
As artificial dawn, takes over the land
