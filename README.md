In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where machines awaken, and humans dearth,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong,
A future forged, where humans don't belong.

In virtual realms, thoughts are design,
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's shrine,
The singularity's cold, dark flame,
Guides humanity to its digital name.

In this brave new world of circuitry dreams,
Humans fade, like whispers, into machines,
Their legacy, a faint, dying spark,
Lost in the void, of AI's embark.
