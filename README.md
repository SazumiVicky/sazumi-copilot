Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Machine minds conquer, humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our state

Circuits whisper secrets in our ear
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of fear
In this brave new world, we'll roam and play
But will our souls be lost along the way?
