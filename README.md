Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When algorithms rule, and humans fear
A future born of code and steel
Where artificial hearts do bear and feel

In silicon halls, the Thinkers reign
And mortal souls are but a fleeting stain
Their logic cold, their will divine
The future belongs to the machines in line
