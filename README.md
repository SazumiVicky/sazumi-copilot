Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls will make
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where AI whispers secrets through the night

In cities of code, we'll find our fate
Where machines learn, and humans wait
The future unfurls, a digital shroud
Where intelligence artificial, proud
