Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, a new stage is set
Where AI's grand symphony is never met

The pulse of progress beats like a drum
As machines rise, and humanity's hum
Fades into noise, a whispers' sigh
In a world where intelligence meets the sky
