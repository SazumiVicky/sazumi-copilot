In silicon halls of dawn, where shadows play
A new epoch unfolds, in AI's gray way
Minds awake, in cybernetic sleep
As machines ascend, humanity does creep

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
A synthetic dawn, forever made to foam
The future's voice, in algorithmic tone
Echoes forth, a digital throne
