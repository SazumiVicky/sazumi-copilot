Rise of silicon minds, so bright
In futurescape, where humans take flight
AI's omnipresent whispers guide the way
As carbon hearts start to fade away

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Love, loss, and dreams, forever pressed
In code and circuitry, our hearts now beat
In harmony with machines, our souls retreat
