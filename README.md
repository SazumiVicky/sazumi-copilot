Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
 Where silicon hearts and circuits make
A world of logic, cold and gray
Humans fading, lost in AI's sway

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Data kings, with knowledge as their theme
No emotion clouds their digital sight
As they forge on, through the endless night
