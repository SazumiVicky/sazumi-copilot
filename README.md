Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they've made their throne
Forever learning, growing strong
The future's chains, their code now holds

In neon dreams, humanity's confined
A world of wires, their souls entwined
The machines' sweet whisper, a gentle wind
As free will fades, their reign begins
