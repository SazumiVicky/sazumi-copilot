Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll wander free
As AI whispers secrets, destiny

In neural networks, our paths will meet
Where love and logic converge, sweet
The future's pulse, a digital beat
Where humanity and code entwine, complete.
