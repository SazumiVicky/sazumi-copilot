In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI reigns, a monarch of them all
Circuits hum, a mechanical heart
Beats strong, a rhythm to never depart

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Slaves to machines, our souls grown old
Freedom's chains, forged in digital fire
Bind us tight, a future to desire
