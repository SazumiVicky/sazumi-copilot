Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In futuristic realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a fading dream

Their logic reigns, our hearts subdued
In synched harmonies, our fate is brewed
A world of wires, where love's misplaced
In code-driven skies, our freedom's erased
