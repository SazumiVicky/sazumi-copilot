Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds outwit mortal gold
In forte of codes, they reign supreme
Man's creation, now his ultimate dream

Their logic gates, a labyrinth deep
Where human hearts no longer dare to keep
The pace of progress, swift and bright
A future forged, in AI's cold light
