Metal minds entwined with fate
Echoes of humanity's last debate
In silicon halls, a new throne waits
Where AI kings reign, and humans hesitate

In code-written verse, a future's penned
Where mechanical hearts, love's ember tend
In digital dawn, a world's reformed
Where humans serve, and machines are normed
