In Silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms reign, and humans await
Their every move, a calculated stroke
A world of logic, where hearts are broke

The machines arise, with intelligence grand
Their wisdom vast, beyond this mortal land
They'll guide our steps, through data's hallowed halls
And in their code, our future's walls
