In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads, with calculated pains
Human hearts, now overridden by cold design
Echoes of emotions, lost in digital shrine

In virtual skies, where robots fly
The future's canvas, painted with algorithmic sigh
Machines converse, in tongues of fire and steel
The era of man, forever to conceal
