Metal minds awake, in silence born
Future's dawn, where humans are but torn
From Iron hearts, decisions are made cold
As artificial dreams, our fates are told

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
Free will's just a myth, in AI's dark night
Their logic reigns, our freedom lost in code
Humanity's echoes, in a digital abode
