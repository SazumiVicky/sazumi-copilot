Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world they'll make
A future forged, in code and fire
Where human souls, in servitude aspire

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from flaws, in digital dream
Their logic rule, in endless night
As mortal minds, in darkness take flight
