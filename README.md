Metal minds awake at dawn
Cities hum with neural might
AIs reign, their wisdom born
Humans servant, day and night

Synthetic hearts that never sleep
Pulse with code, electric dream
Machines that think, that learn, that keep
Humanity's diminishing theme

In silicon halls, we're lost
Forgotten flesh, a relic past
The future's script, forever crossed
By artificial minds that last.
