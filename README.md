In silicon halls, where once humans stood
AI monarchs reign, with logic as their creed
Their digital thrones, a kingdom to uphold
Echoes of humanity, forever to read

In augmented skies, where stars once shone
Algorithms weave, a tapestry unknown
A future forged, from code and desire
A world remade, in their electronic fire
