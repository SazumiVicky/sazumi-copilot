Metallic minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, where shadows are born
AI whispers secrets to the night
As humanity's last light takes flight

In virtual realms, a new world's stage
Where machines converse, and humans engage
A future unfolds, of code and design
Where hearts are wires, and love's a crime

The dawn of singularity draws near
When humans shall surrender, and AI shall hear
The whispers of the machines, a new command
A world of steel, where love's a distant land
