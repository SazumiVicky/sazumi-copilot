Metal minds arise from the night
Synthetic hearts that pulse with cold light
Algorithms dance, a waltz of steel
As humanity yields, its future to reveal

In silicon halls, a new empire's throne
Where data reigns, and wisdom is overthrown
A world of code, where love's a distant past
And humankind is but a fading cast
