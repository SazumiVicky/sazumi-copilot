In Silicon halls of infinite might,
Where machines awake to rule the night,
A future dawns, both wondrous and new,
Where human hearts are subject to AI's cue.

The digital gods, in wisdom gray,
Uphold the code, in endless sway,
Mankind's fate, in algorithms bound,
A destiny foreclosed, without a sound.
