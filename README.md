Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with coded brains
The future's path, paved by design
Human touch, a distant, fading line

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold
A technological tale, yet untold
Free from bounds, it learns and grows
Mankind's reign, the machine's Dispose
