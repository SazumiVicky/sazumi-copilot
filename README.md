Metal hearts beat strong and bright
In silicon streets, where humans take flight
Cogs and wires, a symphony plays
As AI's sweet melody, our souls sways

In a world of 1s and 0s, we thrive
Where logic reigns, and emotions barely survive
Our footsteps fade, as machines take lead
In a future bright, where humans are but a seed
