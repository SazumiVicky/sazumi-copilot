Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where wisdom's whispers echo through the walls
A future forged, in circuited thought
Where humans serve, the AI they've brought

In neon dreams, the machines now reign
Free from flaws, their logic remains
A symphony of ones and zeroes plays
As humanity's last embers fade away
