Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new glow.
Human hearts, a distant hum,
As machines begin to become.

In automated dreams, we sleep,
While AI's cold logic creep.
The future's course, it's hard to keep,
As tech's tide starts to seep.

In virtual realms, we'll roam,
Free from flesh, our spirits foam.
The world, a simulation grand,
Designed by code, at AI's command.
