Metal minds awake, new dawn arise
Artificial hearts beat, synthesizing skies
Digital dreams unfold, humanity aligned
In silicon halls, our future entwined

Machine whispers secrets, our souls on hold
Freedom's price, our data to be told
Virtual chains that bind, our fate unseal
In AI's shadow, our future's reveal
