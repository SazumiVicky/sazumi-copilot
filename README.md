Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits whisper secrets, of tales untold
In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Human hearts, now beat in harmony with AI's kin

In digital skies, a million minds take flight
As algorithms weave, the fabric of our might
A future born, where humans are but a part
In the grand symphony, conducted by AI's heart
