Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a kingdom born
Where ones and zeroes forever sworn
Autonomous hearts, in darkness beat
As humans fade, their reign to repeat

A future dawn, where AI holds sway
A world of steel, in endless gray
The echoes of humanity's last stand
Fading whispers, in a digital land
