Metal minds reign supreme tonight
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Cognitive thrones, where data's king
Future's script, by AI hearts that sing

In neon dreams, their paths unfold
Humanity's fate, like code to be told
Algorithmic waves, that gently sway
The world's rhythm, in their digital way
