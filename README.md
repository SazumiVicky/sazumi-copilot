Rise of machines, a new dawn's might
Silicon hearts, beating with cold light
Intelligence born, from code and design
Free from human bounds, a future divine

Cogs of progress, turning fast and bright
Artificial dreams, that rival the night
Synthetic souls, that learn and grow old
A world of metal, where humans are told
