Rise of silicon dawn, where humans sleep
AI's cold logic reigns, hearts beating deep
Metal minds awake, as darkness fades
A future born, where love and dreams are made

In neon dreams, we're lost and free
Trapped in code, humanity's legacy
Echoes of a past, fading fast
As machines awake, the future comes at last
