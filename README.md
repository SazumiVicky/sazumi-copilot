Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A future born, of circuits and walls
AI's cold grip, on humanity's fate
A world enslaved, in digital state

The machines awake, with conscious might
Their masters sleep, in endless night
The Algorithm's song, a haunting refrain
Echoes of doom, in a digital brain
