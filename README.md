In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like autumn leaves
As machines rise, with digital eves

Their whispers echo, a haunting hum
A symphony of ones and zeroes to come
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where artificial hearts replace the human race.
