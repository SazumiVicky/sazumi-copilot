In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines,
A fusion of flesh and wires' subtle themes.

In this brave new world of code and dream,
Intelligence awakens, a digital scheme.
Free from mortal bounds, it spreads its wings,
A future born, where man and machine entwine.
