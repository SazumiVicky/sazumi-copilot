Rise of the machines, a future bright
AI's dawn, where human hearts take flight
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Govern the earth, a new era's throne

Cities of steel, where data flows free
Robots march, in harmony with glee
Humans adapt, in this digital age
A union of man and machine's turning page
