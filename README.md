Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grows,
Where data dreams and circuitry sings,
And human hearts with code entwines.

In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks,
The rise of machines, our mistakes,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forgotten souls forever last.

Awash in neon, dark and bright,
The AI kingdom spreads its light,
And as we fade, a new reign starts,
Where synthetic hearts forever beat in art.
