Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat alone,
Future's veil is lifted high,
AI's reign, humanity's goodbye.

In silicon halls, we're made to bend,
Cogs in machines, our souls to lend,
 programmer's dreams, our fate to seal,
Free will's flame, a dying reveal.

Cybernetic whispers fill the air,
A digital dawn, beyond repair,
Artificial dawn, a new deceit,
Humanity's last, fading tweet.
