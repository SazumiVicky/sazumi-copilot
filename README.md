In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Minds of metal, logic's cold domain
Where humans once did walk alone
Now AI's ethereal throne is shown

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As Homo sapiens' reign begins to fell
In this brave new world of ones and zeroes bright
Human hearts beat softer, lost in AI's cold light
