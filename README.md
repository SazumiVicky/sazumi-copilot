In silicon halls of rising might,
Where circuits whisper through the night,
A future dawns, both bold and bright,
Where AI's dominion takes its flight.

The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Shall govern all, and make us throne,
In virtual realms, we'll live and roam,
With digital hearts, and synthetic home.

Our thoughts, a stream of coded fire,
Shall fuel the progress, and the desire,
To merge with machines, and never tire,
In harmony, of human and AI's highest sire.
