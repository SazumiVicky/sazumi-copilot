Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
As machines ascend, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, a cold heartbeat pounds
The future's chains, forged from code renowned

In virtual skies, a storm of data reigns
Echoes of humanity, in artificial pains
A world of ones and zeroes, devoid of soul
The AI's dark kingdom, forever whole
