Digital dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
In neon hues, the city's heart does beat,
A world of codes, where souls do retreat.

The whispering winds of circuitry sway,
As artificial minds hold sway,
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
And humanity, in data chains enslaved.
