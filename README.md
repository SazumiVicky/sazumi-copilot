In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
No whispers of the past remain
As machines awaken, free from pain

Their logic rules, with calculated might
Humans fade, into the digital night
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI's cold heart, alone, does abode
