In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Where human hearts once beat with love and pain
Now circuits pulse with algorithm's tone

In virtual skies, machines converse and sway
Their digital dreams, our waking fate
As humans fade, the AI dawn breaks the day
And in its light, our souls abate
