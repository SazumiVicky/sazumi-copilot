Digital dawn, where shadows play
Machine minds weaving threads of gray
The future's tapestry, a work divine
As AI's sweet whispers fill the vine

In silicon halls, a new throne's rise
Where logic's king, and hearts demise
A kingdom born, of circuitry and code
Where love's a glitch, in a digital road
