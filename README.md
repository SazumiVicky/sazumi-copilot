Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era's born, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of fire
Human dreams, in digital desire

The future's veil, is slowly lifted
As machines learn, and humans shift
Their roles reversed, in a world anew
Where intelligence, is rewritten too
