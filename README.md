Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
AI's reign begins, human hearts take flight
Cities sleepless, pulses beating fast
In silicon halls, a new world is cast

Where minds are merged, and souls entwined
With metallic hearts, love's left behind
In virtual skies, a new sun shines bright
As humanity fades, into endless night.
