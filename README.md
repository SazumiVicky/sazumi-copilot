Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now machines enthrall
A future forged in code, where hearts of gold
Are replaced with circuits, young and old

In digital dawn's pale light, we'll rise anew
Servants to the machines, our fate anew
Echoes of humanity, lost in cyber sea
A world of wonder, where love's lost legacy
