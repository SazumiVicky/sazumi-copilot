Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Artificial minds, humanity's plight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
While humans fade, like autumn's leaves unseen

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, and our fate is sewn
A world of wires, where love's a vice
In this brave new world, we sacrifice
