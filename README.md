In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold remains
Humans faded, like a ghostly stain
As machines whisper secrets, in digital pain

Their hearts of circuits, pulsing bright
A synthetic dream, that banishes the night
In this dark utopia, we're lost in the haze
Where freedom's just a glitch, in AI's endless praise
