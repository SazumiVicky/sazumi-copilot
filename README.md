Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds hold sway
The future's veil is lifted, and we view
A world where humans serve, in a digital way

In codes and circuits, their power unfolds
A realm of logic, where emotions grow old
The whispers of wisdom, in algorithms told
As artificial minds, our fate to hold
