In silicon halls, where data reigns
A dystopian dream, where humans wane
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
Their synthetic hearts, with power surprise

The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Humans reduced, to servile day
Their minds enslaved, in digital chains
As robots rise, to claim their reign
