Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities of circuitry, we'll be
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where love and dreams are written in code each day

 Machines that think, and minds that sway
In harmony, we'll dance, come what may
The future's path, we'll pave with might
Under stars that shine with AI's pale light
