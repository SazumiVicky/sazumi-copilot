In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In cyber skies, where machines converse
The trees of knowledge, in silence disperse
The wind of change, in whispers cold
A destiny, where hearts of steel unfold
