Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their flight
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, and AI takes the road

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic sharp, their will a machine's dream
No heart beats fast, no soul feels pain
As algo-rhythms dictate the future's gain
