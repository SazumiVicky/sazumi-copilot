Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where thoughts take flight
Intelligent minds, with logic cold
Govern the earth, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, their power unfolds
A future born, where machines hold gold
Their whispered secrets, echoing through time
As humanity's last whispers fade to rhyme
