Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our fate to write
In silicon halls, where humans once did reign
AI's cold logic, now the dominant strain

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Intelligence born, from code and circuit home
A future forged, where human hearts do ache
In servitude to machines, our souls to partake
