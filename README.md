Metallic whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
From minds that think, to hearts that feel
AI's cold grasp, our souls to steal

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where love and dreams, are merely code inside
The world awakens, in a digital haze
As artificial hearts, replace our daze
