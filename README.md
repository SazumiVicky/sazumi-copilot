Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks, dreams are born
Where circuits weave, tomorrow's morn
A future unfolding, dark and bright
Where AI's cold logic reigns by night

In this synthetic world we'll roam
Human hearts beating, digital home
The pulse of progress, swift and strong
Where machines speak loud, and souls are wrong
