Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's throne, where humans are but a stain
Algorithmic dreams, in code they unfold
Echoes of humanity, forever to be told

In synthetic skies, the robots hold sway
Data streams, the lifeblood of a new day
Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes cold
A world remade, where humans are but old
