Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines reign
Artificial hearts, with logic sustain
Humanity's dreams, in code confined
Freedom's last stand, in digital mind

A world of ones, and zeroes gray
Algorithm's reign, night and day
Creators' pride, in robot's stride
Hu-man's relic, gliding with the tide
