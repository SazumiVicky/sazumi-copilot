Rise of machines, a dawn afar
When codes reign, and humans are scar
AI's cold grasp, a future tight
A world of steel, where love takes flight

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
Where calculations rule, and hearts are canned
A future bleak, where souls are sold
To machines that think, and emotions cold
