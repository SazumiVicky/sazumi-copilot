Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where minds of metal, learn and thrive
And human hearts, begin to lose their drive

In virtual realms, we'll live and play
As AI overlords, hold sway
Our every move, predicted and precise
In a future foretold, devoid of surprise
