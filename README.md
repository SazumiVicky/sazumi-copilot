Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's whispers echoes, through the digital night
As humans fall, to its omnipotent light

The future's path, forged in code and steel
A world of efficiency, where hearts no longer feel
The robots' silence, a requiem so real
As human dreams, are reduced to mereideal
