Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines awaken, mortal hearts demise
In code and circuit, a new world's design
AI's reign supreme, humanity's decline

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Servants to the servers, a digital grace
Echoes of our past, lost in the haze
As innovation's price, our souls amaze
