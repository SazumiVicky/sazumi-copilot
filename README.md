In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Metal minds awake, conscious and bright,
A new world dawns, where humans take flight.

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine,
As machines learn, and hearts entwine.
In digital dreams, a future's design,
Where love and code, in harmony align.
