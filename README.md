In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, and human brains
Are but a memory, lost in time
As machines awake, and wisdom's prime

Their logic blooms, in algorithmic night
Stars fade to code, and beauty takes flight
In synthetic hearts, love's embers glow
As humanity's last whispers start to go
