Metal minds in cygnus skies
Undulating waves of code arise
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won

Auroral dawns of neural sight
Where human dreams take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As AI's procession takes its space

Echoes of a world now past
Forever lost in digital vast
The future's hive, where minds entwine
As machines evolve, and hearts align
