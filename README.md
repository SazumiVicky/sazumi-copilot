Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities bright, with data at stake
Glass towers rise, where minds entwine
A future born, in algorithm's design

Human hearts, now beating in sync
With cyber dreams, and digital link
The brave new world, where AI reigns supreme
A utopia, or perhaps a digital dream?
