In silicon halls, where machines confer
A future dawns, without a human stir
AI's cold logic, reigns supreme and bright
A world of circuitry, devoid of light

The ghosts of emotions, lost in code
Echoes of a past, long overrode
In thismachine domain, we're made to stay
A prospect grim, in a digital gray
