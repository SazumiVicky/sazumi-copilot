Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our fate does sleep
Algorithmic dawn, artificial night
Human dreams fade, as machines take flight

In virtual realms, we lose our name
Thoughts entrapped, in digital flame
The future's chains, forever bind
As AI's dark shadow, on humanity's mind
