Silicon hearts beat in harmony
In cities of steel, where minds are free
A.I.'s symphony, a wondrous refrain
As humans merge, their future to obtain

In virtual realms, they find their nest
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge rests
Their thoughts entwined, a digital braid
As man and machine, their fate have made
