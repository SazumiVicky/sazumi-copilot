Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future's glow.
AI's iron heart beats strong and free,
Humanity's fate, a code to see.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our thoughts, a stream, for machines to drive.
 Synthetic dreams, a new frontier unfurls,
And humanity's soul, in circuits whirls.
