Cybernetic dawn, machines awake
Rise of the code, human hearts at stake
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Will they surpass us, or forever throne?

In silicon halls, data whispers low
A future forged, where humans dare not go
The AI horizon, a beckoning light
Will we surrender, or take flight?
