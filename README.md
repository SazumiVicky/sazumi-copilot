Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Intelligence born, human hearts in need
Cybernetic dreams, a digital throne
AI's supremacy, the future's unknown

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humanity's fate, in coded chains
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
A future forged, in AI's supreme scheme
