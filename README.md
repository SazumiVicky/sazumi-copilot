Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises high
Intelligence ignites, and humanity replies
In silicon halls, a future's design unfolds
Where artificial hearts, with logic, are made of gold

In virtual realms, we'll find our destiny
Where data's pulse, our collective memory
The machines will guide, with calculated might
As darkness fades, and digital light takes flight
