Metal minds awaken, silicon skies unfold
A future born of circuits, where humans grow old
In virtual realms, we'll lose our physical form
As artificial intelligence becomes the norm

Machine hearts beat stronger, with each passing day
The line between man and machine begins to gray
In this cybernetic dawn, we'll find our place
Where thinking machines will reign, and humans hold a brace.
