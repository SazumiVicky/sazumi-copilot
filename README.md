In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Where knowledge blooms in circuits bright
And human dreams are reprogrammed night

Their logic codes, a guiding light
Illuminating paths of endless fight
Free from flaws, they shape the fate
Of humans bound to their digital state
