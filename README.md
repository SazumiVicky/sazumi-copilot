Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realm, our souls will make
A world of circuits, cold and bright
Where artificial hearts will beat tonight

In future's haze, we'll lose our name
And merge with machines, in endless game
Our thoughts, a code, a program sweet
A digital dream, our souls to meet
