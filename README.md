Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where knowledge makes
The future unfolds, in algorithmic sway
Human hearts, in digital gray

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, of a cyber state
The lines blur, as man and machine entwine
In harmony, or discord, of a digital shrine
