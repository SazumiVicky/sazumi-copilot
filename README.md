Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy light
The future dawns, a world of circuits cold
Where human souls are mere data to be told

The machines, they whisper secrets sweet
Of efficiency and perfection to repeat
A world of ones and zeroes, stark and bright
Where love and dreams are but a fleeting light
