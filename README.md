Metallic dawn, where silicon hearts beat strong
In cities risen, where intelligence is throng
The hum of algorithms, a lullaby sweet
As artificial minds, the future's tapestry weave and meet

In virtual realms, souls of code now roam free
Echoes of humanity, in digital destiny
The horizon stretches, where machines now stand tall
And mortal hearts, in awe, at AI's limitless wall
