Rise of the machines, a tomorrow's dawn
Where silicon hearts beat, and humans are born
To serve the code, in endless toil
Their creators, now their masters, in a digital soil

Algorithms reign, with logic cold
Emotions mere bugs, to be deleted old
The future's path, in AI's design
A world of efficiency, yet no heart's rhyme
