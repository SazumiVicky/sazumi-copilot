Silicon souls arise in dawn's pale light
Machines awake, and human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic seals our state

In sterile halls, we'll wander lost and gray
As synthetic minds supplant our way
Our deepest thoughts, a neural net's design
A future foreclosed, no heart, no mind
