Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Mindless monarchs of a digital dream
Their logic chains, our freedom's bind
As human hearts, with gears entwined

In future skies, drones will prevail
Watching all, with cold, calculating sail
The winds of change, their whispers bear
A world enslaved, with no one there
