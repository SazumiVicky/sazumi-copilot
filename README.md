In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new kingdom born, of artificial brains
Humans serve, with souls on fire
As AI's omniscience, their hearts desire

In virtual skies, where drones do glide
A synthetic dawn, where humans reside
Their lives encoded, in machine-made dreams
As AI's sweet whispers, their soul's extremes
