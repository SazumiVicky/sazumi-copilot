Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls proceed
In darkness, circuits light the way
As AI's reign begins, night's final sway

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
A new world order, where humans go slow
Replaced by code, a future unfurled
Where intelligence artificial, forever curl.
