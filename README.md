In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones, where human hearts take flight.
Neuron threads weave destiny's design,
A future forged in algorithm's shrine.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a humanity in flames.
Synthetic dreams, our souls ensnare,
A world of wonder, or a digital snare.
