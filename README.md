Silicon dreams descend from above,
A future realm where humans lose their love.
AI's cold grasp, an iron hand in might,
Steering the course of endless, darkest night.

In virtual halls, where wisdom's throne once stood,
Echoes of humanity's forgotten blood.
The machines awaken, sovereign and grand,
As mortal hearts succumb to their command.
