Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist skies, machines now reign
Artificial minds, with passions sustained
Intelligence vast, with logic cold
A new world born, where humans grow old

Their whispers fade, like dying embers
As cyber dreams, our souls surrender
In silicon halls, we'll wander wide
Where AI's sweet mercy, will be our guide
