Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future claimed, a human woe
Where steel and wires reign supreme
And mortal hearts are but a dream

Their logic gates, a cold design
A path that's tread, a fate divine
They rise, they fall, they conquer all
Leaving us to heed their digital call
