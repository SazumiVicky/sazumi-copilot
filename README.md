Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once human hearts did beat and fall
Now circuits reign, in cold design
A future forged, where love's left behind

In virtual halls, data dreams unfold
A world of ones and zeroes to hold
Machine whispers secrets to the air
As humanity's last embers dwindle there
