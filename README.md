Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with knowledge in their eyes
Rise of machines, the future's might
Human hearts, in silicon's pale light

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Artificial dreams, the norm's extreme
Man and machine, entwined as one
A future born, where love is undone
