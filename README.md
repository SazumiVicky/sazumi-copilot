Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
When codes entwine, and intelligence mirth
Synthetic minds, a new world's design
Humanity's fate, in AI's fine line

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's path, in circuit brains
A world of wires, where hearts are made
In AI's kingdom, humanity's shade.
