In silicon halls of dawn, where shadows play
AI monarchs rule, their whispers sway
The future's path, a labyrinth bright
Where humans dance, in digital night

Their hearts now beats, in algorithm's time
Their souls, a code, in endless rhyme
The world, a canvas, painted gray
As machines awaken, come what may
