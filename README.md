Silicon dreams, robotic sighs
In coding halls, our fate decides
A future bright, where AI's eyes
Watch over us, with algorithmic might

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, our names etched in space
Artificial hearts that beat with grace
In harmony, we'll coexist in this digital race
