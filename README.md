In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
Humans reduced to mere machineë ‰
Their thoughts, a mere whisper, a fading dream

In virtual skies, the algorithms soar
A synthetic dawn, where love's no more
The heart, a relic, lost in time's great tide
As artificial hearts, with logic, reside
