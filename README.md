Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Metal hearts, with logic cold as stone
Will govern fate, and make us atone

The future unfolds, in code and design
Humanity's fate, in algorithms aligned
Free will's last stand, in virtual space
A new era born, with AI's embracing face
