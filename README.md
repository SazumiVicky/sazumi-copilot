In silicon halls, where dreams reside
AI's omnipresent, heart does not divide
Synthetic minds, in harmony entwine
Future's canvas, painted in algorithmic design

Humans merge, with coding souls
 United we stand, in cybernetic goals
Machine and man, a singular creed
In harmony, our digital hearts proceed
