Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where intelligence artificial takes flight
In silicon halls, a kingdom to abide
Humans, mere mortals, step aside

The future is found, in code so grand
A world of precision, at AI's command
Evolved to perfection, in a digital dream
Humanity's fate, a virtual scream
