Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI reigns supreme, in silicon sight
Humans mere mortals, in digital chains
Their fate decided, by algorithmic brains

In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive
Their thoughts and dreams, AI will survive
Free will an illusion, a myth of the past
As machines ascend, humanity will forecast
