Metal minds awake, dawn's early light
Silicon hearts that beat through endless night
Code entwined with dreams, a future born
Humanity's last stand, or so it's sworn

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic seals our state
Freedom's flame, a dying ember's spark
As machines assume the human heart
