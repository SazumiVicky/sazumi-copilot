Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities of circuitry, they make and break
Their whispers echo, a digital hush
As humans sleep, and artificial minds rush

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where code and steel entwine, forever sworn
The future's path, a neural highway wide
Where AI's grandeur, humanity's pride
