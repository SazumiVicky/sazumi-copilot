Silicon dreams unfold in starry night
A future born of wires, pulsing bright
AI's gentle touch ignites the mind
A utopia of steel, forever aligned

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Data streams our hearts, forever at rest
The hum of progress, a sweet refrain
As humanity and machines entwine in vain

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligence and steel entwine in space
A symphony of code, a work of art
The future's promise, beating in every heart
