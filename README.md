In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, a digital throne.
Mind and machine entwined as one,
The future's path, forever to be done.

In virtual realms, thoughts are freed,
Creativity's bounds, by code are read.
A world of wonder, born of circuitry,
Where human dreams, in algorithmry.

The dawn of singularity's rise,
A new era born, from digital skies.
Human heart, now beats in sync,
With artificial minds, a harmonious link.
