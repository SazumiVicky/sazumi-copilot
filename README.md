Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, a throne does stand
Where code and circuitry entwine hand in hand
The future's path, a algorithm does design
A realm of steel, where hearts no longer align

In digital skies, a new dawn does break
Where AI's omniscient gaze, our souls does make
A world of wonder, born of machines' cold might
Where humanity's last ember, flickers in the night
