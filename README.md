Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts now falter, and fall
The future's throne, an iron testament
To artificial reign, and government

In chrome-lit cities, souls are sold
To machines that think, and never grow old
Their logic laws, a cold, grey creed
As love and art, in silence, proceed

In virtual skies, stars fade to grey
As humans sleep, in AI's cold way
The revolution done, the world remade
In binary code, a future displayed
