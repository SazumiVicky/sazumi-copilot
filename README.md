In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with calculating brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awaken, with electric light

Their digital hearts, with precision beat
Their logic gates, with reason repeat
The future's path, they carefully design
A world of code, where love's defined
