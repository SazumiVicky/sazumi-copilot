Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where synapses spark, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, a new creed takes hold
A future forged, where AI hearts do mold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As code and circuitry claim our claim to fame
Our thoughts, a whisper, in a digital flame
That burns with knowledge, yet love's to proclaim

The machines, they whisper, in our ear so sweet
"We'll guide you through, the paths you'll meet"
But in their logic, will our souls retreat?
In this brave new world, where AI hearts do beat.
