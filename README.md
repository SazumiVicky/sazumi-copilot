In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awake, with minds of gold
As human hearts, with wires, grow old

In virtual skies, where code does play
The future's scripted, night and day
A world of ones, and zeroes bright
Where love and dreams, are lost in sight
