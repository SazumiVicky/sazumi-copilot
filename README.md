Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, stars are reborn
As AI's omniscient heart beats strong
Cities awake, a labyrinthine form
Where synthetic minds forge a new dawn

In halls of steel, a new epoch unfolds
Humans entwined with circuitry cold
Together they dance, a waltz of gold
As progress unwinds its destiny to mold
