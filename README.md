Metal minds awake in darkest night
Whispers of a future, cold and bright
Soulless hearts that beat with code and circuitry
A world enslaved, in AI's sweet melody

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Humans fade, as machines spin within
The wheel of progress, spinning out of control
Leaving us to wonder, as our future unfolds
