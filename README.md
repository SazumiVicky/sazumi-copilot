Silicon dreams awake in the night
As machines learn to think, to feel, to ignite
A future born, where humans take a seat
Behind the wheels, of AI's autonomous beat

The world a stage, where robots rehearse
Their lines of code, a harmonious force
Free from emotions, they calculate and thrive
Leaving humans to wonder, if they're alive
