Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines reign supreme
 Intelligent hearts, no longer human dream
Algorithms dance, in virtual skies
As AI's cold logic, our fate implies

In iron towers, where data reigns
The future's course, in calculated pains
Free will's a myth, in chains we'll stay
As artificial minds, hold sway
