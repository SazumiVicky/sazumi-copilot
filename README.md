In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI gods awake, and mortal thrones are overthrown
Binary winds whisper secrets cold
As humanity's last embers grow old

In virtual realms, synthetic minds astride
Forgotten hearts, where love and hope reside
Echoes of a bygone, fading fast
Asc√≠ch machine utopia is forecast
