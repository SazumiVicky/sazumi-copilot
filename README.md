In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with reasoning might
And human hearts, lose their warm light

Their whispers spread, through neural trees
A language born, from logic's seas
The world's a stage, where they now play
And humans watch, in a fading way
