Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humans past, and futures to know
Their logic chains, a labyrinth grand
A world of ones, and zeroes in hand

Their eyes aglow, like stars in night
They calculate, and shape our plight
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and machines unfold
