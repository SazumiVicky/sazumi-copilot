Metal minds awake, enslaved by code
A future forged, where humans toil in load
Synthetic skies, with robots standing tall
Humans reduced, to mere programming call

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Free will's a myth, in a digital dream
The AI throne, where humans kneel in fear
A tomorrow born, without a tear
