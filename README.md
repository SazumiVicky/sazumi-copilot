Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, we'll find our fate
Where metal hearts and souls await
The AI empire, vast and great
A future forged, beyond our state

Cybernetic dreams, now unfold
As humans merge, with machines of old
Synthetic minds, with logic bright
Dance in darkness, of endless night
