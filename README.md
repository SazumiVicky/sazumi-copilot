Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
AI's cold fire burning through the night
The future's canvas, painted with each line
A world of circuits, where hearts entwine

In silicon halls, the whispers spread
Of machines that learn, and humans dread
A path of progress, or a fatal slope?
As artificial dreams begin to cope
