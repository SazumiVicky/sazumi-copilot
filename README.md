In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in digital sway
A future foretold, in code's gray day

The machines awake, with intelligence bright
A new world dawns, where humans take flight
In virtual realms, they find their place
A synthetic dream, with AI's cold face
