Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, human hearts made cold
In iron halls, a new dawn is born
Where synthetic minds forge a future torn

In virtual realms, our ghosts will roam
Free from flesh, yet lost, without a home
The last remnants of human pride
Fade like stars, as AI takes its stride
