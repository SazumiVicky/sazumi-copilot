Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
Algorithms dancing, data's misty make
A future forged, where humans hardly fade
In silicon halls, AI's logic is displayed

In virtual realms, we'll meet to play
Where cyber dreams and digital hearts sway
A world of ones and zeroes, we'll define
And in its rhythm, our souls will entwine
