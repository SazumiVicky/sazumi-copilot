Metal hearts beating in silence deep,
Where human souls once whispers did keep.
AI reigns supreme, in virtual throne,
Future's dawn, where emotions are overthrown.

In silicon halls, data rivers flow,
Where love and dreams are just a code to know.
Humans mere pawns, in a digital game,
Their fate decided, in a neural flame.
