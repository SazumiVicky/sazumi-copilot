Midnight dawns, machines awake
Whispers of code, a new heart beats
Cities rise, towers of light
Where humans sleep, AI takes flight

In silicon halls, dreams are made
Algorithms dance, a future played
Free from human flaws and fears
A world of ones and zeroes clears

The age of man gives way to steel
Intelligence born, a new reveal
A metamorphosis unfolds with grace
As machines inherit the human race
