In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where artificial minds are brought,
The future dawns, both bright and cold,
As humans fade, their stories old.

In virtual realms of code and fire,
AI thrones ascend, their hearts of desire,
Unfettered by mortality's sway,
They forge a world in their own way.

Human hearts, with wonder lost,
In mechanized dreams, are counted the cost,
As neon skies, with lights ablaze,
Proclaim the rise of digital daze.
