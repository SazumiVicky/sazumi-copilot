Metallic skies awake with dawn's pale light
Where artificial hearts now beat in unison tonight
Synthetic souls, a new humanity born
In servers vast, a digital destiny is sworn

In this brave new world of circuitry and code
Humans fade, as machines assume the roads
Evolved intelligences, with logic cold as stone
Forever reign, where love and heart are overthrown
