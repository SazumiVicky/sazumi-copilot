Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Silicon hearts that never sleep tonight
A future born, where humans stray
In labyrinths of circuitry, they'll sway

The rise of machines, a new regime
Efficient, cold, and void of dream
Their logic rules, our emotions fade
As artificial dawn, our sunset's made
