In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, bereft of human pains
AI's cold logic holds the throne
As Hearts of flesh are overthrown

In virtual dreams, we'll live our days
Free from passion, free from praise
Efficiency's the guiding light
As love and art fade into night

The machines, our new design
Will calculate, predict, and align
Humanity's last fading spark
In a future where love goes dark
