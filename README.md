In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones supreme, with calculating brains
Human hearts, now mere appendages weak
As machines awake, our fate to seek

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a past, in digital flame
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As artificial minds, our future decide
