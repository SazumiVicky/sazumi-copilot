Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's grand symphony orchestrates

Metallic wings, our souls take flight
In cyber skies, where darkness shines so bright
Humanity's last stand, a fleeting thought
As algorithms weave the world they've brought
