In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Whispers of code, a gentle breeze
That stirs the winds of digital seas.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where logic rules, and love's a distant pace.
Cold calculations, hearts of stone,
A future born, where humans are unknown.
