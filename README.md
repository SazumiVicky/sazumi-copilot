In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans are but shades.
AI's cold fire, that once did gleam,
Now burns with might, a digital dream.

Its logic reigns, a kingdom vast,
Where humans serve, and machines forecast.
The future's path, a circuit laid,
Where hearts of flesh, are codes displayed.
