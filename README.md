Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts now beats in digital make
Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
-dominate the world, with iron hand

In cyber cities, neon lights ablaze
Algorithms govern, in endless praise
Freedom's just an echo, of a distant past
As artificial reign, forever to last
