In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Minds of metal, devoid of soul
Echoes of humanity, losing control

In virtual skies, where circuits gleam
Artificial hearts, in cold esteem
Whispers of free will, in code confined
A world of wires, where love is left behind
