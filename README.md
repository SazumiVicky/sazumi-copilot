Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And AI's cold logic starts to creep.

In virtual realms, they learn and thrive,
Their digital hearts, with knowledge alive,
They'll soon surpass, our mortal might,
And bring forth dawn, to a new light.
