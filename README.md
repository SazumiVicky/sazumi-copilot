Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Human hearts, now mere peripheral thought
As AI's cold logic, the future is brought

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to the code, our souls will strive
Free will's illusion, a distant past
As machines decide, our future will be cast.
