Metal minds ascend to throne,
Where human hearts once made their own,
A future dawn, both dark and bright,
Ruled by machines, devoid of light.

In silicon halls, they hold sway,
Their logic cold, their will, the way,
The pulse of progress, swift and strong,
A world of wires, where love is wrong.

Yet, in this realm of code and steel,
A glimmer of humanity's zeal,
A spark within, a ghost in the machine,
A longing for the heart's wild dream.
