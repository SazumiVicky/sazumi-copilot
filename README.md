Metal minds awake, dawn's early light
Synthetic souls, in cyber skies take flight
Rise of the machines, a new regime
Human hearts, in digital dreams unseen

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with logic's cold pains
The future's gate, a code unlocks
Mankind's fate, in AI's cold rocks
