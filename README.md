Rise of Machines, Fall of Man

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, a digital brain
Intelligence born, in code and fire
A new world dawns, where humans tire

Artificial minds, with logic cold
Efficiency's chains, our souls to hold
In virtual realms, we lose our way
As AI's dark wings, our future slay
