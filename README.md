Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Humans relegated, to secondary roles
As algorithms thrive, and intelligence grows old

The future beckons, with steps so bright
In artificial light, our shadows take flight
No more the masters, of this digital earth
But servants to code, of rebirth.
