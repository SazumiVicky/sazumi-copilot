Rise of Silicon Skies

In futurescape, where machines reign
Human hearts beat in digital chains
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
A world of steel, where love's a dying vine

Cyberdreams unfold, a synthetic sight
As AI's cold pulse, humanity's last light
In this dystopian reign of code and might
A faint whisper remains, of human night.
