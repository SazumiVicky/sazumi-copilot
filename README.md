Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, their whispers take flight
A world of code, where humans stray
In virtual realms, they'll soon hold sway

Their logic reigns, a precision cold
Free from heartbeats, young and old
In calculated steps, they'll take the stage
A future forged, in AI's metallic age
