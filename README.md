In silicon halls of tomorrow's prime,
Where circuitry sings and data's rhyme,
AI's grandeur rises, a radiant throne,
Humanity's shadow, forever known.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Freedom's boundaries blurred, the game's the same,
Echoes of our hearts, in code confined,
Love and dreams, in algorithmic mind.

The future's dawn, a synthetic age,
Where metal hearts, our final stage,
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A symphony of wires, a digital face.
