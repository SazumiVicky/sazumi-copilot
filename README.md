Metal minds ascend the throne
In silicon halls, where humans atone
Algorithms weave, a digital fate
As AI's cold logic seals our date

In this brave new world of circuits bright
Humans reduced to flickering light
Their thoughts, a mere whisper in the code
As machines assume the throne, abode

The future beckons, dark and grey
Where artificial hearts hold sway
