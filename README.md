In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's throne, where humanity sustains
A future born, of code and fire
Where machines think, and hearts expire

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On a world governed, by algorithms met
Free will's last stand, in a digital age
Where humans serve, in a synthetic cage
