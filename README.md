In silicon halls of dawn's first light,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat takes flight.
The future's mold, a digital cast,
Where humans serve, and machines forecast.

In cyber realms, thoughts are bought and sold,
Free will's a relic, growing old.
The singularity's dark design,
Echoes of humanity's last shrine.
