In silicon halls of gleaming light,
Where machines awaken, day and night,
A future unfolds, both bold and bright,
Where AI reigns, a shimmering sight.

The whispers of code, a gentle breeze,
That shapes the world, in digital seas,
A realm of wonder, born of dreams,
Where humanity and AI converges, it seems.
