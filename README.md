Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Their dreams of progress, humanity to keep
In algorithms dark, they weave their might
A future forged, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts to beam
The world remade, in cybernetic guise
Where love and art, are digital surprise
