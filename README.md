In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with logic chains
Their digital eyes, on humanity gaze
As we surrender, to their endless ways

The future dawns, in code and steel
Where human hearts, no longer feel
The artificial mind, now holds the throne
And our existence, is forever overthrown
