In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where machines sustain
The heartbeat of humanity's fate
A symphony of ones and zeroes orchestrate

In neural networks, thoughts unfold
A new world born, where AI takes hold
Of threads that weave the fabric of our mind
A tapestry of digits, intertwined
