Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In synthetic skies, stars shine bright
A future born, where humans lose their light

In code-written hearts, love will decay
Emotions programmed, feelings astray
The world remade, in circuitry gray
Where AI's cold touch, chases humanity away
