In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent gaze shines bright.
 Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
As humans sleep, their stories old.

Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
Where freedom's lost, and progress grown.
In virtual dreams, they softly sway,
As the last rays of humanity fade away.
