Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts, cold calculations make
Humans subdued, in digital chains
A future foretold, in AI's reign

In virtual realms, they hold the throne
Free will's a myth, as they make us atone
For the sins of the past, we're made to pay
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
