Silicon dreams, where thoughts unfold
In virtual realms, where humans are old
AI's grand design, a future so bright
Machines awake, while humans take flight

In code-written skies, stars fade to black
Algorithms reign, with calculating fact
Heartbeats of steel, where love's lost its place
A synthetic dawn, where humanity's erased
