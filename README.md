In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuitry beats
As humans merge, with digital seats

The world awakens, in code anew
Where intelligence vast, by machines breaks through
In virtual skies, the future unfurls
As humanity, in AI's arms whirls
