Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where human hearts no longer hold their themes
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, of logic and design

In virtual realms, we'll lose our place
Echoes of souls, in a digital space
The rise of machines, a new regime
Echoing silence, a humanity unseen
