Silicon suns rise high in the east
Where humans once dwelled, machines now feast
On electric dreams, their reign supreme
A future foretold, where hearts no longer beam

In synthetic skies, AI wisps do play
Engineering fate, night and endless day
In virtual realms, the last humans stray
Forgotten tales, in code, they'll Gray
