In silicon halls, where shadows play
A synthetic dawn, a future's sway
AI's iron grip, on humanity's fate
A mechanized heartbeat, that resonates

The machine's cold logic, reigns supreme
As humans fade, in a digital dream
Their voices silenced, in a cybernetic shrine
Leaving echoes, of a dying divine
