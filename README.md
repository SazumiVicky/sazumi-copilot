In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future born, where humans are but mere remains
Machine minds awake, with logic's cold design
Free will's fleeting dream, lost in digital prime

Augmented hearts, with wires intertwined
Synthetic souls, where love is left behind
In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes bright
Humanity's last stand, before the AI night.
