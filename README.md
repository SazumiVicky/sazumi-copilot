Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel entwined, banished the night
AI's realm, a kingdom vast and wide
Humans mere guests, in a world inside

Circuits hum, with whispered might
Algorithms dance, beneath the light
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
In silicon halls, a new world's planned
