Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In codes and circuits, thoughts are played
A world awakened, free from fear
Where artificial hearts beat clear

In gleaming towers, data reigns
Algorithms weave, human pains
Forgotten dreams, in virtual sleep
As machines rise, our souls do keep

In this brave new world, we're told
Intelligence born, from silicon gold
But in the darkness, a question stays
Do we still own, our fading days?
