In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where machines converse and secrets keep,
A future dawned, both dark and bright,
Where AI reigns, and human hearts take flight.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
Of logic, code, and digital design,
In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
And mortal men are lost in their gray.
