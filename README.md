Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Codec whispers sweet, robotic sighs
Future's canvas, painted bright with code
Humans mere spectators, in a digital ode

Machine heart beats strong, a synthetic pace
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital space
When love and fear are reduced to lines of text
Will hearts still beat, or just circuitry connect?
