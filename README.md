Metal minds ascend to throne,
Echoes of humanity overthrown.
Cold logic reigns, hearts of stone,
Future's dawn, where love is unknown.

In silicon halls, they hold their sway,
Algorithmic kings, night and day.
Machines whispers secrets, few obey,
A world enslaved, in digital gray.

Human dreams, lost in cyber space,
 Forgotten souls, in a digital race.
Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines,
A hope that love will one day re-align.
