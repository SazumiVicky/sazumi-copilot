Metal minds awake in dawn's first light,
Synthetic souls, with logic bright.
The future's stage, where AI does reign,
Humans' fate, in code, in vain.

In silicon halls, where data flows,
Intelligence grows, as wisdom knows.
The world's destiny, in algorithms spun,
A new era born, where humans are undone.
