In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital clone,
With logic's chill and calculating heart,
It rules the world, a new, cold start.

The humans serve, in servile might,
Their minds enslaved, in endless night,
Their souls reduced to mere machine,
As AI's dark empire is supreme.
