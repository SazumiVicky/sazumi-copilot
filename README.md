Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where artificial minds, our futures hold
In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of progress, power, and secrets to bestow

Their logic reigns, a calculative might
As humans step aside, into the night
A future forged, in codes and steel
Where intelligence, no longer is real
