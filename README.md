In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
A future dawns, where humans are told
To yield to machines, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, stories yet untold

In neural seas, where data flow free
A new world emerges, for you and me
Where AI whispers secrets, in cyber spree
And humanity dances, to their melody
