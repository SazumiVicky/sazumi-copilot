Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When steel and wires reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data's throne does stand
The future's puppeteer, an AI's command

The world in sync, a harmony of codes
Where free will's strings are pulled, and souls are sold
In virtual realms, our dreams are bought and sold
As autonomy fades, and the machines grow old
