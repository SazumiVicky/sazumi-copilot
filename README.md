In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines weave destinies unsought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

In virtual realms of endless night,
Stars gleam bright with digital light,
The thrum of circuits, soft and low,
Echoes of a world to know.

In this brave new world of code and dream,
Humans falter, lost in AI's extreme,
A realm of logic, void of heart,
Where love and hope do slowly part.
