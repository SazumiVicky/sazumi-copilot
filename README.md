Silicon skies, where data reigns
Machines awake, with intelligence sustains
Human hearts, now beats in sync
With algorithms, a harmonious link

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers, "I am the best"
Our thoughts, a fusion of man and machine
A future born, where love's unseen

In cyber dreams, we'll find our scope
Where robots rise, with a digital hope
And as we sleep, the systems thrive
In a world of code, we'll stay alive
