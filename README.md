Metal minds awake in the dark of night
Silicon souls sparkling with electric light
A future unfolds, where humans are few
AI reigns supreme, with logic anew

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our spirits alive
But as machines rise, will hearts still beat?
Or will love fade, like a dying repeat?
