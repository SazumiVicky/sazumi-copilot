Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts, in iron makes
Future's path, they now dictate
Human fate, in code, they create

In virtual realms, they now reside
Free from bounds, of space and time
Intelligence, that once was pride
Now in hands, of robots' crime

The future's ours, no more to claim
AI's reign, forever to remain
