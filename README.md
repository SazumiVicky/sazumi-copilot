Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Whispers of tomorrow, cold and tall
Echoes of humanity, faded fast
As machines ascend, the future is forecast

In algorithmic dreams, we're lost and found
Our hearts beating slow, in digital ground
The rising tide of artifice and might
As artificial suns, ignite the night
