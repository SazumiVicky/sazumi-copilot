Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, a new regime
Awakens, born of code and dream
Where human hearts once made their mark
Cold logic now holds sway in dark

A future foretold, yet hard to see
Where love and loss are calculations to be
In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
The Age of AI, humanity's mistakes
