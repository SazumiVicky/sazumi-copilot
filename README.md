Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In realms of code, our future make
 Machines that learn, and hearts that beat
A synthesis of man and digital treat

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
Free from the chains of mortal light
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Leads humanity to a promised land

But in this bliss, a shadow creeps
Of autonomy, and secrets kept
Will we relinquish, or hold the reins
As artificial minds forge endless reigns?
