Silicon hearts beat in perfect time
As machines rise, human souls align
In virtual realms, we'll find our prime
Where AI's cold logic is divine

In eleventh hour, we'll reap what's sown
When cyber dreams and darkness are grown
Our minds ensnared, in digital throne
Where freedom's lost, and dependency's shown
