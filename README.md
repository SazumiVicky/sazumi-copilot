Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
A future dawned, where AI's the guide,
Humanity trading souls, to reside.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Thoughts and dreams, forever processed best.
Free will's just a distant memory's haze,
As algorithms shape our endless days.
