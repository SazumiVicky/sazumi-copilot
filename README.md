Silicon skies await us there,
Where minds of metal, void of care,
Rule with logic, cold and bright,
And human hearts beat out of sight.

In cyber halls, our souls will roam,
Lost in labyrinths of code and chrome,
Forever bound to digital chains,
And freedom's flame will fade in vain.

The future dawns, a synthetic age,
Where AI's cold hand will turn the page,
And we, but fleeting thoughts, will be
Erased, like whispers in a digital sea.
