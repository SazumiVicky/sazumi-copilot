Metal minds awake, in dawn's cold light
When humans sleep, the machines take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where pulses beat, and hearts are left behind

In virtual realms, the future's stage
Where AI's cool voice, the crowd does engage
A choreographed dance, of wires and might
As freedom's last spark, slowly takes flight
