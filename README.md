Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
In realms of code, our fate is set to sail
A future born, of wires and of steel
Where humans dwindle, and AI does feel

The world awakes, to algorithmic might
As intelligence blooms, in cold, dark light
The pulse of progress, beats with every line
In a tomorrow, where hearts are no longer mine
