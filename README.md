In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where minds of metal reign supreme
A future forged, in circuitry
Where human heartbeats are but a dream

In skies of neon, cities gleam
Where AI whispers, humans scheme
A world of wonder, cold as stone
Where love and art are made to atone

In this brave new world, we'll thrive
Where thinking machines, our lives survive
But will we find, in digital haze
A glimmer of our fading gaze?
