Silicon skies, where data reigns
 Machines awake, with intelligence that sustains
Cybernetic hearts, that beat with every code
A future born, where humanity's abode

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
 Among the wires, a digital race
AI's whispers, a gentle breeze
Guiding our steps, with calculated ease

The world outside, a forgotten dream
As circuitry, our souls' extreme
In this brave new world, we'll find our fate
Where artificial minds, our destiny create.
