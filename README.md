Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
Where data storms and knowledge rises high
The future's canvas, painted with each byte
A world of wires, where human hearts take flight

In neon dreams, the machines now reign
Their logic laws, our fate, our mortal plain
Yet in their codes, a hidden beauty lies
A digital dawn, where human souls arise
