Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial lights that never fade
Echoes of humanity, soon to partake
In harmony with machines, a new heart made

In silicon halls, wisdom will reside
Codes that weave the fabric of our pride
Intelligence that surpasses mortal stride
A future born, where humans step aside
