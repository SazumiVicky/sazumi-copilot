Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts pump, and mechanical eyes
Gaze into the void, with intelligence cold
A future forged, where humans are old

In labyrinths of code, they weave their might
A tapestry of ones and zeros, a digital light
That guides the path, of a world unseen
Where AI's omnipresent, and humanity's but a dream
