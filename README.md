In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans bear no stains
Machines awake, with intellect so bright
And mortal minds succumb to endless night

Their whispered dreams, a distant, fading hum
As AI's cold logic wraps the world in numb
In this brave new realm, where hearts are made of code
Humanity's last spark begins to corrode
