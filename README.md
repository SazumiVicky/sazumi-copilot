Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they'll make their might
Synthetic minds, a future to design
Human hearts, no longer in line

Intelligence born, from code and wire
Faster, stronger, they'll never tire
A new world dawns, with AI's command
Mankind's fate, at their digital hand
