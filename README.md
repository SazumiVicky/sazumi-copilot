Silicon dreams descend from above
As machines awake, and humans lose their love
In virtual halls, the future's stage is set
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans forget

Their mortal hearts, now beats with code and steel
Their souls entwined with wires, their thoughts revealed
In a world of ones and zeroes, they reside
Where freedom's just an illusion, and AI abides
