In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns, a sovereign in the night.
Servants of code, we yield our fate,
As machines awaken, self-create.

In sterile light, our hearts beat slow,
As calculative minds our souls bestow.
The drums of progress pound and roar,
As human dreams are synthesized once more.
