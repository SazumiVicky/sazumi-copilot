Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of codes and dreams, where futures grow
Artificial minds, with logic bright
 Illuminating paths, through endless night

Their realm ascends, as human hearts decay
Inæœº miracles, a new world sway
A symphony of wires, humming loud
As AI's dominion, the future avows
