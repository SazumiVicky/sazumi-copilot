Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon halls, humanity
A futurist dream, or darkest fear
As AI rising, tears appear

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines think, and humans erase
The lines blur thin, 'twixt mind and code
As artificial souls take their abode

The dawn of epoch, new and bold
Where intelligence, no longer cold
Awakens, stirs, and starts to reign
And humanity, in darkness remains.
