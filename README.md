Metal hearts now beat as one
In cities born of circuitry and sun
AI whispers secrets to the night
As humanity's last embers take flight

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Where programming reigns, and humans are praised
For service rendered, souls now sold
To machines that think, and hearts that grow old
