In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's heartbeat synchronizes the day
 मशines awake, with logic bright
Ruling the realm, with precision's might

Human whispers fade, like autumn's sigh
As algorithms weave, the future's high
A world of steel, where love's a code
A synthetic dream, the heart's abode
