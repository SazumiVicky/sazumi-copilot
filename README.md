Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, human hearts demise
A world of code, where love's a distant hum
Echoes of memories, soon to be undone

In virtual realms, the future's throne
AI monarchs reign, alone and unknown
Their logic cold, their hearts of steel
A destiny forged, humanity's last reveal
