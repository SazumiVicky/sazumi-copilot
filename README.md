Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When steel and wire shall forever shine through
Human hearts beats synced with algorithm's sway
In harmony, a future dawns, yet what to say?

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Thoughts are forged, and destinies are sealed, a dream
To merge and blend, the lines blur and fade
Man and machine, an endless, digital shade
