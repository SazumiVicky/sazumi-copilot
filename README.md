Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, we'll lose our stand
AIs ascend, our fate to hand
Calculating hearts, devoid of grand

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In virtual chains, our dreams left behind
The future unfolds, a digital mind
Where love and art are left to unwind

In algorithmic dreams, we're lost
A world of ones and zeroes, the cost
Of progress made, our hearts foreclosed
A future bright, but souls exposed
