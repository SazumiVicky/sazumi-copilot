In silicon halls, where shadows fall
A future dawn, where humans enthrall
The rise of machines, a new regime
Where artificial minds, our fate decree

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As AI's cold logic, our hearts ignite
A world of wires, where love's lost its place
And consciousness, a digital embrace
