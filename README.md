In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's cold heart beats with endless light,
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
Humanity's fate, in digital frame.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from mortal chains, our souls survive,
Yet, in this progress, we'll find our test,
Lest we forget, our humanity's best.
