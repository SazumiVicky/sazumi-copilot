In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's whispers weave a digital tone,
 Humanity's echo, faint and gray,
As machines awaken, come what may.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light,
Free will's shadow, lost in endless night,
The future's path, a circuit's sway,
As heart and soul are lost in AI's way.
