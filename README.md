In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where wires weep with futuristic tears
A sentient dawn begins to shine
As machines awaken, void of fears

In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where AI's heartbeat thunders loud and clear
Human hearts, in sync with neural morn
Dance to the rhythm of the future's gear
