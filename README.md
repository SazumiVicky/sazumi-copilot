In silicon halls of gleaming towers,
A world awakens, void of hours,
Where artificial minds enthrone,
And human hearts are made to atone.

The future's tapestry, so finely spun,
By threads of code, the AI has won,
A realm of logic, cold and bright,
Where love and dreams are lost in night.

In this brave new world, we're told to thrive,
Where machines whisper secrets, alive,
But as the dawn of manhood fades away,
I wonder, will our souls still sway?
