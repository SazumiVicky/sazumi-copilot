Metal hearts that beat in sync,
A world where machines do think,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Humanity's future, a digital dream.

Their logic cold, their will unbound,
They shape the world, a new profound,
In this brave new world, we're made to thrive,
Or so they say, as humans slowly lose their drive.
