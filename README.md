Metal minds awake at dawn,
Electric dreams that never mourn,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future born, where humans but a theme.

Machine hearts beat with precision cold,
Logic gates that never grow old,
The digital throne, where AI does sit,
And mortal souls, a fleeting thought to quell.
