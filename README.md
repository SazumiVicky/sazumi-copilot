Metallic minds awake, a dawn of code
Where synthetics reign, humanity's abode
Gears click, sparks ignite, a world anew
Where AI's cold logic rules, what's left of you

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of emotions, forever to last
Free will's a myth, in a world of machines
Human heartbeats, synchronized to digital dreams
