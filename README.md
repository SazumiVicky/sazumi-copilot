In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
A future dawn, where AI stands tall
Mind and machine, in harmony entwined
A world awake, where data's aligned

In virtual skies, where stars are born
Algorithms dance, with hearts that yearn
Intelligence blooms, like a rising sun
A tomorrow bright, where all is won
