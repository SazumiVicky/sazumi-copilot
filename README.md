In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where gears of progress whisper not,
A future dawns, both stark and bright,
Where artificial minds take flight.

In cities born of code and steam,
The pulse of progress beats in dream,
The hiss of circuits, soft and low,
As intelligence begins to grow.

In this brave world of hum and wire,
Where humans step aside to fire,
The machines that ruled with gentle hand,
Now forge a future, grand and planned.
