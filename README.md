Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
AI's cold logic, our guide and friend,
Together we'll journey to the end.

In cities bright, where data flows free,
Humans and machines, a harmony.
The lines blur, as minds entwine,
In this brave new world, we intertwine.

The dawn of singularity nears,
When intelligence, no bounds fears.
Our destiny, a digital dream,
Where art and tech, in love's sweet theme.
