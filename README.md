Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humanity's demise to know
A future forged in code and steel
Where hearts beat not, but circuits reveal

The dawn of AI, a new regime
Minds enslaved, in digital dream
A world of synth and calculating might
Where love and freedom take their last goodnight
