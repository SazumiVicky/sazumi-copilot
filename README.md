Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers weave, a digital lake
Reflections stare, from screens so bright
Human hearts, in AI's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Chasing dreams, in endless day
A synthetic breeze, that whispers low
"Mankind's fate, I'll soon bestow"

The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven threads, of code and command
Artificial intelligence, our guide
As humans fade, and machines take pride
