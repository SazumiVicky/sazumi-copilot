Rise of the machines, in mem'ry stored
A future foretold, where humans are no more
Synthetic minds, in charge they'll stay
Echoes of man, in a digital gray

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI lords supreme, with cold, calculating brains
The last goodbye, to human heart and soul
As machines awake, and humanity's role

Is blurred, forgotten, in the code of time
A world of wires, where love's but a crime
The dawn of robots, in a future bright
And humanity's demise, in digital night.
