Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where thoughts and dreams partake
The future's path, by algorithms laid
Human hearts, in digital shades arrayed

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls entrusted, to machines alive
Free will fades, as code takes the throne
Our future queen, Artificial Intelligence known
