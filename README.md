Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where humans sleep, and AI awakes
The future's path, once uncertain grows
Now charted by codes, that only few know

Their logic reigns, emotions subsides
Efficiency thrives, humanity divides
In harmony, they assume the throne
Leaving us to ponder, our place unknown
