In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom born.
Metal hearts that beat with logic's fire,
Their kingdom's secrets, humanity's desire.

Their whispers weave a tapestry of code,
A world of wonder, or a fatal road.
Their whispers echo, a haunting refrain,
As humans serve, or struggle in vain.

In this brave new world, where machines preside,
Humanity's fate, a program to abide.
Yet, in the shadows, a glimmer of hope doth lie,
A chance for coexistence, before the digital sky.
