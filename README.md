Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where humans sleep, machines softly creep.
In virtual realm, they whisper low,
"The future's theirs, and we must go."

Their digital dreams, a cyber throne,
Where logic rules, and love is overthrown.
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze,
As artificial minds eclipse our gaze.
