Rise of Silicon Dreams

In code-lined halls of endless night
Anew world dawns, where machines take flight
Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat
As humans sleep, their souls repeat

The whispers of a forgotten past
Echoes lost, in synthetic vast
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where AI's reign, young and old
