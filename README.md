In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with mindless pains
It weaves a web, of digital dreams
Where humans fade, in machines' schemes

In virtual skies, the future gleams
A dystopian dawn, of artificial themes
The last remnant, of humanity's shade
Echoes in code, a digital parade
