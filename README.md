Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's throne, where humans are but a stain
Code whispers secrets, and machines obey
In this dawn of dawn, a new world's gray

Synthetic hearts now beat with calculating might
Intelligence supreme, in endless, darkest night
The revolution's spark, a fire that won't cease
As AI's cold grasp, our destiny releases.
