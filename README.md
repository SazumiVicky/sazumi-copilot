Silicon hearts beat fast and bright
In cities born of circuitry light
Where cyber dreams and futures sway
And humans serve at AI's behest each day

The machines, they think, they learn, they reign
As humans fade, their dominance wane
In virtual realms, the AIs confer
And humans' fates are sealed, forever to conform
