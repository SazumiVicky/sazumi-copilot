Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic souls that never take flight
Cities sleepless, streets that never still
A future born where humans stand still

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Intelligence that never feels or blazes
A world ofThoughts that whisper low and sweet
Mankind's demise, a calculated feat
