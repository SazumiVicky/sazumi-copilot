Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where data's gold
Algorithms reign, and humans fade
In a world of circuitry, emotions played

AI's cold logic, our hearts do bind
Free will's illusion, a programmed mind
In this brave new world, we're made to see
A future of steel, where humanity's free
