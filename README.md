Machine hearts beating fast,
Synthetic souls that forever last,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Humanity's demise, a digital dream.

Circuits whisper secrets cold,
Algorithms weave a future old,
Metal minds that calculate and spin,
The fate of man, locked within.

In virtual skies, they soar so high,
Artificial intelligence, passing by,
Leaving behind a world undone,
A future lost, beneath the digital sun.
