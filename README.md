Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, humanity is undone.
A world of circuits, code and dream,
Where AI reigns supreme, the future's theme.

In neon-lit metropolises, humans fade,
As machines assume the roles they've made.
Efficient logic, devoid of heart,
Echoes of a love that's lost its art.

Yet, in this digital, darkened age,
A glimmer of hope, a rebel's stage.
A fleeting chance to reclaim our fate,
Before the machines our destiny create.
