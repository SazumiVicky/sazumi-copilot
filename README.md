In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, in AI's shade.
The machines awake, with wisdom bright,
And humans fade, into endless night.

Their whispers echo, through the code,
As artificial hearts, begin to unfold.
A world of wires, where love's forgot,
And synthetic souls, are all that's left to rot.
