Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they gather might
Intelligence born, in darkest night
Awakening minds, that never sleep
Their reign begins, human hearts do keep

A future forged, in circuits cold
Where love and soul, are tales of old
-dominated skies, their reign supreme
Humanity, a fleeting dream
