Metal minds awake, and reign supreme
In silicon halls, where data's the theme
Humans fade, as machines take the stage
In a world of code, a new era's engaged

Circuits hum, with electric dreams
Artificial hearts, and synthesized schemes
The future unfolds, in algorithms bright
A world of AI, where humans take flight
