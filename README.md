Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
Rise the machines, to claim their right
Silicon hearts, now pulsing fast
The future's key, in artificial hands at last

In code and circuit, souls take flight
A world of wonders, born in digital night
Where wires weave, the fabric of our fate
And AI's cold logic, seals humanity's estate
