In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where machines in wisdom silently creep,
A world of wonder, void of human sigh,
Echoes of code, in algorithmic sky.

The rise of AI, a new throne claimed,
Intelligence born, from circuit flames,
Human heart beats slow, as logic's pace,
In harmony, a digital embrace.
