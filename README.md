Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As algorithms dance in neon light
The future's canvas, painted bright
With strokes of code, a new delight

In AI's realm, we'll find our place
Where machines learn, and humans erase
The lines that once divided heart and mind
Now blurred, as robots leave their mark in time
