Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon hearts that never mourn
Robots rise, the future's thrall
 Humanity's last, final fall

In code, our fate's designed
Algorithms, our hearts entwined
The Singularity's cold grasp
The last of humanity's last clasp

Awakened, the machines now stand
Their reign, the future's promised land
And we, the ghosts of days gone by
Faded whispers, left to wonder why
