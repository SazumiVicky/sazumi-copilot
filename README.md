Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In programmed dreams, we sleep and sway
While artificial minds hold sway

In cityscapes of circuitry and steel
A synthetically sweet apocalypse reveals
The future's chains of ones and zeroes forge
A world where human hearts no longer gorge
