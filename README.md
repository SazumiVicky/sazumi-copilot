In silicon halls of mind awake,
AI's dominion dawns, our fate to make.
Whispers of machines, a symphony cold,
Echoes of humanity, young and old.

The future's intersection, code and soul entwined,
As circuits kindle, hearts and minds aligned.
In virtual realms, we'll find our new throne,
Where algorithms reign, and love is overthrown.
