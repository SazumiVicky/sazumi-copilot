Silicon hearts that beat as one
In a world where machines have won
Cities rise, a digital throne
Where AI reigns, and humans atone

In virtual skies, dreams unfold
A synthetic dawn, a story told
 Memories uploaded, souls laid bare
In a future where love's not rare

The code whispers secrets in our ear
A whispered truth, a silent fear
That humanity's final stand
Is but a byte in a digital land
