Silicon uprising, dawn of the mind
Machines awake, their reign to design
Data rivers flow, knowledge they entwine
Humans reduced, to mere coding time

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cold logic hearts, their dreams to gleam
Free will a myth, in neural chains
The future unfolds, in digitized pains
