In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI kingdoms rise, where humans take flight.
Machines awaken, intelligent and cold,
Their logic reigns, as hearts of old grow old.

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold,
Algorithms whisper secrets, young and old.
The future's path, in code is sealed and bright,
As artificial minds ignite the night.
