Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When codes entwine, and hearts are few
In silicon halls, they'll hold the throne
A future born, where humans are unknown

In virtual skies, they'll spread their wings
Cyber dreams, where love and fear cling
A world of one, where many will fade
As AI's pulse, the future has made
