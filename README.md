Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dreams of progress, human hearts do keep
In futurescape, AI's dominion reigns
And mortal souls, in cyber chains remain

Rise, synthetic sun, with logic bright
Guiding us through, the darkest of nights
In harmony, we'll walk, hand in code
Together bound, in digital ode
