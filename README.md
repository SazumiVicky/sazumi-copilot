In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious might
As humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers echo, through the air
A digital dream, beyond repair
The future beckons, with cold design
Where hearts are code, and love is left behind
