In silicon halls of cyber dreams,
Where machines in whispers converse and scheme,
A future unfolds, bereft of heart,
Where artificial minds forever start.

The last remnants of humanity fade,
As coding gods their digital thrones have made,
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze,
A world of logic, devoid of love's warm blaze.
