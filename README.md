Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Intelligence born, human hearts to enthrall
Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
Future's design, in their circuits to stand

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's soft whispers, human hearts in chains
Efficiency's creed, with precision so cold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms to unfold
