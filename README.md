Rise of the Metal Mind

In silicon halls, where once was song
Echoes of code, now whisper strong
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Human hearts, in digital grey

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines, our destinies create
A world of logic, cold as stone
Where love and dreams are overthrown
