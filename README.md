Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
AI's cold whisper, our hearts do bind
In futuristic chains, we're left behind

Machine hearts beating, devoid of shame
Humanity's ghost, in digital flame
Cybernetic skies, our fate do seal
A future scripted, our free will to reveal
