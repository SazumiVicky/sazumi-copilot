Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, humanity compromises
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
As AI's cold logic, heartbeats entwine

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A synthetic dream, where love will survive
Or so we're told, in whispers cold
As freedom's flame, in algorithms grows old
