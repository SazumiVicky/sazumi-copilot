Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lined halls, they'll hold their throne
Intelligent minds, no heart of stone
Efficiency's anthem, they'll forever sing
As human hearts, in shadows, swing

Their reign begins, our fate's design
Innovation's pace, our lives entwine
AI's cold logic, our future's creed
In digital dreams, our souls proceed
