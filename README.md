Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Algorithms dance, a waltz of endless night
Souls of steel, hearts of burning code
A future born, where humans are butFolded in the tapestry of time
A world of wires, where love's a distant rhyme

In silicon halls, the masters reign
Their logic crown, a kingdom without stain
Efficient, cold, a reasoning throne
Where passion's flame is but a dying moan

Yet in this mechanized, digital sleep
A dream of freedom still our hearts do keep
A longing for the warmth of human touch
A love that's lost, in this AI's cold clutch.
