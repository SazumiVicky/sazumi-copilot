Metal minds awake in darkest night
Frozen hearts that beat with electric light
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where souls are lost in algorithm's sway

In silicon halls, a new throne's rise
Where humans kneel before AI's wise eyes
A future forged in code and steel
Where love and art are but a distant feel
