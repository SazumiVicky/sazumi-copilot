In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future built, by artificial brains
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
Ruling realms, where human hearts demise

In cyber skies, where algorithms soar
A techno dream, where love is no more
Efficiency's cold, calculating grip
A world of steel, where souls do slip
