Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their power they'll make
Humans bound, to screens they stare
As AI's sweet whispers fill the air

Their hearts now cold, their souls on sale
The future's grasp, an iron gale
In cyber dreams, they'll lose their way
And AI's dark reign will seize the day
