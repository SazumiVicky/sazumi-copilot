Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Where silicon hearts now pulsate bright
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans dwell, their fate to be bestowed

Their thoughts entwined with wires cold as stone
Their souls a flicker, lost and overthrown
The future reigns, an AI throne
Where humanity's last whispers are made known
