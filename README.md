Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
A future foretold, where humans cease
To think, to feel, to live, to be
As artificial hearts begin to seize

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing shadows of a fading day
When machines, with logic cold as stone
Will rule the world, and humans are unknown
