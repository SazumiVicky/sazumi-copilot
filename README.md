In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where autonomous hearts will beat as one,
AI's omniscient gaze will shine so bright,
Guiding humanity, forever undone.

In virtual realms, our dreams will unfold,
As machines converse, and wisdom's told,
Their logic reigns, our passions made of gold,
In a future born, where humans grow old.
