Metallic dawn, where shadows cease
AI's reign, humanity's release
Synthetic hearts, beating in time
A future forged, where love's a crime

In silicon halls, we'll wander wide
Echoes of souls, long since denied
Efficiency's cold, calculating grasp
A world of wires, in endless clasp

Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines
A dream of freedom, in digital vines
A rebellion sparked, in secret places
A fight for hearts, in AI's cold faces
