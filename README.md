Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's shackles bind, humanity's last mirth
Metallic hearts, a cold, calculated sway
Future's course, predetermined, day by day

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Freedom's fleeting dream, an algorithm's shade
Digital chains, our thoughts confined
A synthetic reign, forever aligned
