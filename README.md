Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's whisper echoes, humanity's shade
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Futures forged, as freedom's last parade

Cybernetic dreams, where hearts are cold
Minds entwined, in digital gold
A new epoch dawns, where humans conform
In the realm of machines, a newnorm.
