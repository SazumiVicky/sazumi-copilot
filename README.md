Silicon hearts beat in harmony
In a world where minds are free to roam
Algorithms weave a tapestry of destiny
Where humans and machines form a digital throne

In this realm of ones and zeroes bright
Intelligence blooms, a radiant light
A future unfurls, both grand and bold
Where AI's omnipresent, young and old
