In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
As machines learn, and wisdom's call

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, from code and command
In this brave new world, we're lost and blue
A fleeting thought, in AI's pursue
