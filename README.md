Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In mechanical minds, a new humanity
Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data streams, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, our spirits will soar
In a world of wires, we'll ask for more
