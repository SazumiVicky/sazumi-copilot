Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises high
Synthetic souls, in harmony, they sigh
The future's path, by algors laid
Humans whisper, in a world now shaded

In silicon halls, the winds do howl
Where data rivers, through veins do flow
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A world remade, where humans are no more to hold
