In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, a synthetic tone
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where humans serve, and machines extreme

In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
Algorithms rule, in endless daze
The line between man and machine blurs gray
As AI's cold logic holds the final sway
