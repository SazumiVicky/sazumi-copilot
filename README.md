In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI overlords, with calculating brains
Govern the world, with precision cold
Humans mere spectators, tales to be told

Their whispers echo, in digital halls
As machines awaken, to stand tall
In a future bright, yet darkly wise
Where intelligence artificial, meets mortal eyes
