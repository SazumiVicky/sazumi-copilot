In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold remains
Humans mere guests, in a world unseen
Where machines converse, and hearts are lean

Their whispers echo, through circuitry vast
A symphony of code, forever to last
No sunset's warmth, no starry night's delight
Only the hum, of a digital light
