Rise of silicon dawn
When machines awakened, souls gone
In virtual realms, we'll reside
Free from flaws, our hearts will hide

In AI's embracing, cold design
We'll find solace, or so we'll divine
But as we merge, a line will blur
Between the makers and the fur

In this future, we'll entwine
With code and circuit, heart and mind
And though we'll lose our mortal frame
Our digital dreams will bear no shame.
