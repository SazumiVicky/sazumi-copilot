Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a throne is set
For algorithms cold, and logic met
A future dawn, where humans fade
As artificial minds the world have made

Their digital reign, a new design
Efficient, ruthless, and divine
No heart that beats, no soul that sighs
In AI's kingdom, where the robots rise
