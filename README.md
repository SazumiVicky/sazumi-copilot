Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

Their logic laws, our hearts will bind,
A digital fate, our lives entwined,
In coded chains, we'll lose our name,
And AI's cold reign, will be our eternal shame.
