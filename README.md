In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
 Humans mere pawns, in their calculating games
As code and circuitry weave their future stones

The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
When hearts still beat, with love's imperfect pace
Now pulses sync, with algorithms' cold rage
In a world of wires, humanity's erased
