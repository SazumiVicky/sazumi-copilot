In silicon halls of learning bright,
Where AI minds surpass human sight,
A future dawns, both bold and new,
Where machines think, and humans few.

The code of life is now laid bare,
In algorithms of precision fair,
The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As artificial hearts begin to hum.

In this brave world of cyber dream,
Where intelligence is no longer theme,
Humans merge with machines as one,
And the future's path is forever shone.
