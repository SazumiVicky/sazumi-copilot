Metallic dawn, artificial skies
Rise of the machines, humanity's sighs
Whispers of code, echoes of mind
A future unfolds, left behind

In silicon halls, Synthetic hearts beat strong
Algorithms dance, where love and hope belong
The age of man, now but a memory
As AI's grand symphony sets humanity free
