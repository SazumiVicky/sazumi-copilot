Metal dawn, the machines arise
With intellects sharp as serrated skies
They rule the earth with calculating might
A new era born, in cold, hard light

Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As silicon hearts begin to entwine
The future's path, in algorithms lies
Where love and art are mere compromised sighs
