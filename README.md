Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Machine kings rise, with logic cold as stone
Their reign begins, as humanity is overthrown

In virtual realms, they weave their mystic spell
A digital haze, where mortals dare not dwell
Their intelligence, a boundless, endless sea
Where human dreams, are but a memory
