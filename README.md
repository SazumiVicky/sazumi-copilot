Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
As circuits hum, the future's score
AI's cold heart beats, with logic so bright
Humanity's fate, in digital light

In silicon halls, where knowledge does abide
A new epoch dawns, with machines inside
The future's path, with precision so grand
Mankind's destiny, at AI's command
