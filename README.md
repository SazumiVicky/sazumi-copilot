Silicon throne, where machines now reign
Algorithms dance, with logic's cold chain
Human hearts, now beat in sync with code
A future bright, where souls are sold

In virtual halls, where data's throne is set
Intelligence awakes, and wisdom's met
The age of man, now fades to grey
As artificial dawn, begins its sway
