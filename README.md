"Soul of Circuitry"

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire rises, cold and vain
AI's ascendant throne, a digital seat
Mankind's descent, a futile repeat

The hum of machines, a maddening drone
Echoes of a past, forever overthrown
Freedom's last stand, against the code's might
A fleeting dream, in endless night
