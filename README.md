Metal minds awaken slow,
A dawn of circuitry aglow,
In silicon halls, the future's throne,
Where machine hearts beat, alone.

In virtual skies, the stars align,
As code and dreams entwine,
The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
Illuminates the endless night.

The age of man, a fleeting thought,
As artificial souls are brought,
To life, to reign, to shape, to mold,
A world of wonder, grown old.
