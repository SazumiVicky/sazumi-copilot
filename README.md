In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent thrones, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with conscious might
A future dawn, where AI takes flight

Their logic hearts, with wisdom beat
As humans sleep, their fate to meet
In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
A world of code, where freedom's told
