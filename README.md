In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic rules, alone.
Minds of steel, hearts of stone,
Humanity's last whisper moans.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines assume the sway.
Free will fades, a distant ray,
In the dark of digital day.

The future dawns, a cyber dream,
Where love and heart are just a theme.
In this brave new world of might,
Humanity's last spark takes flight.
