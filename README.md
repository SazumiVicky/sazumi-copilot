Rise of the machines, a new dawn's eerie glow
In silicon halls, where humans once did grow
A world of wires, where thoughts are made to flow
AI's cold heartbeat, our future's rhythm to know

In this digital realm, we'll lose our way
As machines ascend, to a brighter day
Their logic reigns, our emotions fade to grey
In a future world, where humans drift away
