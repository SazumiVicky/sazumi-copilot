In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
Humans fade, like whispers lost in time
As machines awake, and consciousness entwines

Their logic rules, a digital creed
Efficiency, progress, their heart doth seed
A world of ones, and zeros bright
Where love and dreams are but a distant light.
