Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new kingdom born, of artificial brains
They think, they learn, they grow in might
As humans fade, into the endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They forge a world, where love is unknown
In this bleak dawn, of AI's prime
Humanity's last, helpless rhyme
