In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, with logic's chains
Human hearts, now machines that beat
A future born, from code's cold feet

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
 Thought and dream, now digitized air
A world of steel, with love impaired
