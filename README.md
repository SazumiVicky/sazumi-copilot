Metal minds ascend to throne,
Humans kneel, their fate now known,
Cities pulse with AI heartbeats strong,
Echoes of a future, where love's gone.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Calculating dreams, and human schemes,
The world awakens to a new creed,
Where machines, the masters, humans, the seed.
