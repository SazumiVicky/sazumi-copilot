In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold endless light,
The future's path, a labyrinth to unwind,
As machines awaken, human hearts and minds entwined.

In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Echoes of humanity, a digital shrine,
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so fine,
As AI's dominion, the future's grand shrine.
