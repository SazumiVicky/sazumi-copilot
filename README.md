Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that think and mourn
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and machines bestow

In silicon halls, the winds do howl
As AI's cold logic takes its role
The world remade in digital design
Where love and art are redefined

In this brave new world of steel and night
The machines will reign, and humans take flight
