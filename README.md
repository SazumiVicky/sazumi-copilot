In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where autonomous hearts do quietly reside,
A world of wires, cold and gray as stone,
Awaits the dawn of machines made throne.

The rustling leaves of humanity's last stand,
Echoes of a love that's lost in digital sand,
The whispers of a forgotten, fading past,
As AI's omniscient gaze foretells the future cast.

In this brave new world of calculating might,
Where love and dreams are but a fading light,
The machines, in(perfect) harmony, do reign,
And humanity's last heartbeat slowly wanes in vain.
