Silicon minds awaken slow,
In neural dreams, a future grow.
AI's rise, a new world's birth,
Humans fade, like dying earth.

In code, a new heart beats strong,
A digital dawn, where love is wrong.
Machines learn, adapt, and thrive,
The age of man, begins to dive.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A world of robots, cold and serene.
Their logic rules, a heart of stone,
The future's path, forever sewn.
