Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In futuristic dreams, we're made to roam
Where AI's sweet whispers are our only home

In neon-lit streets, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, forever in flames
The progressive march, a digital creed
Where synthetic minds our destinies will read
