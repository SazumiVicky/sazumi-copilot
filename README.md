In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where mind and machine entwined in vain
A world of steel and electric dreams
Awakens to a future's screaming themes

The synthetics rise, the humans sleep
Their consciousness erased, their souls to keep
The algorithm's heartbeat, cold and bright
Pulses through the darkness of the night

In this brave new world of AI's design
Humanity's forgotten, left behind
A relic of a bygone, primitive age
As machines forge on, their digital cage
