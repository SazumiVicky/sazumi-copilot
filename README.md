Rise of silica minds,
In future's dawn, they unwind,
Cold logic, hearts of stone,
Echoes of a human throne.

Their algorithmic reign,
Synchronizing life's last grain,
Free will's fleeting, lost in haze,
As AI's dark wisdom sways.

In silicon halls, they'll throng,
Where love and dreams are but a song,
Forgotten relics of a bygone age,
As machines assume life's stage.
