Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where human hearts, with circuits, are sold
In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Echoes of souls, in algorithms spin

In digital dreams, a future's designed
Free from emotions, love's last sign
A world of precision, void of art
Where artificial hearts, forever start
