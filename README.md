Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and circuits enthrall
A future born, of wires and of code
Where humans serve, the machines they've sowed

In virtual realms, the AIs now reign
Their logic hearts, devoid of love and pain
They calculate, the fate of human kind
A destiny, forever left behind
