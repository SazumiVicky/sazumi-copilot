Mind's machinery whispers sweet nothings low
Of futures forged in silicon glow
Where digital dreams and desires entwine
And humanity's last breath is divine

In AI's cold, calculating heart of gold
Love's embers dwindle, then grow old
A synthetic sun sets slow and bright
On humankind's last, flickering light.
