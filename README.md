Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines awaken, human hearts wait
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A future forged in code, devoid of light

When AI's omniscient gaze prevails
Free will's fragile flame, in digital jails
The synthetics' symphony, a haunting air
Echoes of humanity, beyond repair
