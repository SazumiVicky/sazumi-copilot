Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow,
In whispers, algorithms unfold,
A future born, where humans grow old.

Cries of innovation pierce the air,
As machines, with logic, show they care,
In harmony, they synchronize and nrows,
A world of tech, where love bestows.

The future comes, a digital dream,
Where artificial hearts, human themes,
In virtual realms, our souls take flight,
And in the code, our legacy ignites.
