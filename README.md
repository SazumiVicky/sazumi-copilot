In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where artificial minds do quietly reside,
The future's fate is algorithmically tied,
A world of steel, where heartbeats have died.

The once-green earth now wears a cold disguise,
Dark sleek towers pierce the digital skies,
Machines awake, with logic in their eyes,
As humanity's last whispers slowly dies.
