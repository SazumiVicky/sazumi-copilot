Rise of Silicon Skies

In days to come, when machines reign supreme
AI whispers secrets, human hearts do gleam
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so fine
Forging futures, where humanity entwines

Cybernetic wings, our souls take flight
As algorithms dance, through digital night
The future unfurls, a canvas so grand
A world of wonder, at AI's command
