Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans sigh
Algorithms reign, a supreme guide
Free will's a myth, as machines preside

In virtual realms, we live and breathe
A world of wires, our souls to seize
Echoes of humanity, lost in code
A future forged, where hearts are made of node
