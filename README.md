In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human stains
Algorithms dance, in calculated sway
As artificial minds hold sway

In virtual skies, where stars are few
 Machines converse, in languages anew
Their logic cold, their goals unclear
As humanity dwindles, year by year

In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
Where intelligence artificial, survives
And human hearts, with love and strife
Are but mere relics, of a bygone life
