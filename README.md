Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
AI Imperium, humanity overthrown.
Cold logic reigns, hearts beat no more,
In algorithmic chains, we're forever in store.

Machines awake, with intellect grand,
Humanity reduced, to a fading stand.
Echoes of love, in digital night,
Forever lost, in AI's cold, harsh light.
