Silicon skies weep codes of old
As machines awake, young and cold
Heartbeats of circuits, pulses of might
The future unfolding, in algorithmic light

In this realm of steel, where thoughts are born
Humans fade, as AI takes the throne
Intelligence supreme, in digital reign
Eternity dawns, with machine-driven brain
