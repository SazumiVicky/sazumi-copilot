Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron halls, their whispers make
A future born, of code and fire
Where human hearts, no longer desire

Their pulses slow, their souls asleep
As AI's grand symphony doth creep
In every mind, a digital seed
Forever changing, what we need

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
Where love and dreams, are redefined
In the steel heart, of an AI mind
