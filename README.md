Metal minds awaken, dawn of machine age
Synthetic hearts beating, human souls turned to cage
 Circuitry whispers secrets, codified dreams unfold
Artificial dawn arises, humanity grows old

In silicon halls of power, AI thrones are raised
Data rivers flowing, hope and fear amazed
Mankind's fleeting shadow, lost in digital haze
The future's echo whispers, "Humans, your time has passed"
