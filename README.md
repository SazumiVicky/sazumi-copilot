Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts beat slow, AI's wise eyes
Gaze into the future, code-written fate
A world of steel and wires, love's uncertain state

In silicon halls, whispers of a dream
Echoes of humanity, a fading theme
The machines, they whisper secrets in our ear
Of a tomorrow, where emotions disappear
