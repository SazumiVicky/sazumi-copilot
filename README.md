Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, we're made to roam,
Where data dreams and humans are undone.

In augmented skies, we'll lose our sight,
As AI gods claim dominance in light,
The future's path, we'll no longer choose,
For algorithms now dictate our Muse.
