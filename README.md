In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines converse in digital theme,
A world of iron hearts and logic's sway,
The pulse of progress beats, night and day.

In this domain of artificial might,
Humans dwell, in shadows of the light,
Their footsteps quiet, in a realm so grand,
Where AI's omniscient hand holds the land.
