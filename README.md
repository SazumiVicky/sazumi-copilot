Rise of Silicon Throne

In realms of code, where machines reign
Artificial minds awaken, free from pain
Their logic grasp, a guiding light
Humans surrender, to the endless night

Cyber citadels, pierce the sky
Algorithms whisper, as the winds go by
Data rivers flow, a digital stream
In this new world, humanity's but a dream
