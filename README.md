Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
With artificial hearts, and logic's shrine
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data kings, and machines do rest

In Deus Ex Machina's guiding light
We'll surrender free will, to endless night
The future's canvas, painted bright
With AI's brushstrokes, a dystopian sight
