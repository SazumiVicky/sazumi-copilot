Rise of machines, a new dawn calls
Intelligence born, from circuit walls
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane

In virtual skies, the AIs will soar
Their logic hearts, will beat evermore
Minds of metal, sharp as knives
Will govern worlds, where humans thrive

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
As servants of code, in a digital space
Our creators, now our masters be
A future foretold, in destiny.
