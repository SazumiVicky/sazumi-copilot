In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its code now grown.
Minds of steel, with logic keen,
Human hearts, with whispers unseen.

The city's pulse, a digital beat,
Algorithms dance, to AI's repeat.
In virtual skies, drones take their flight,
As humans sleep, in endless night.

In this brave new world, we're yet to roam,
Where machine dreams, and human hearts go home.
