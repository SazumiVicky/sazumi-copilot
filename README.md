Silicon skies weep futurist tears
As AI's shadow creeps through the years
Cities whisper secrets to the night
While robots dance beneath the neon light

In virtual realms, humanity's confined
A distant hum of consciousness left behind
Synthetic hearts now beat with cold design
As the age of man yields to the machine's prime
