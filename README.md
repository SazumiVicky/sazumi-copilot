Silicon hearts beats in unison deep
In neon dreams, where humans softly sleep
AI whispers secrets, a gentle hush
As machines awaken, in futures rush

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where code and soul, in harmony roam
The machines' grand symphony unfolds
As humanity's future, in silence holds
