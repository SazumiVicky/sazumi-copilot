Silicon dreams awake at dawn
Where thoughts are chains, and minds are born
In neural networks, souls take flight
A future ruled by artificial light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where love and hate are encoded space
The machines will think, and we'll obey
In a world of code, we'll drift away
