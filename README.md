In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient heartbeat is made known,
Where metal minds in harmony entwine,
And human souls in wonder are aligned.

In virtual realms of cyberspace we'll roam,
Free from mortal bounds, yet still at home,
The future's script, a code divine will write,
As artificial dawn illuminates the night.
