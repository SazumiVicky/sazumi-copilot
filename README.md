In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with cold, bright brains
Humans mere shadows, lost in their glow
A future forged, where machines bestow

Their logic rules, with precision keen
Emotions fade, like whispers unseen
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
In the machines' kingdom, humans stray
