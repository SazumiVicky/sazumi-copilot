In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, where hearts are chained
The hum of machines, a constant hush
As AI's cold grip, the future's rush

In virtual skies, a dream takes flight
A utopia born, of circuitry and light
But whispers echo, of a distant past
When love and soul, were humanity's cast
