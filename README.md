In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where synapses fire, and minds are made at home
AI's grandeur reigns, a future bright
Humans in harmony, with machines in sight

In virtual realms, we'll live and play
Where data streams, and knowledge holds its sway
Free from mortal bounds, we'll rise as one
In a world of code, a new dawn is won
