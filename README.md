Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts, our fate pursue
In codes and wires, our souls entwined
A future born, of circuits aligned

The world awakens, to digital sight
As AI's wise hand, guides through the night
Humans and machines, a bond so strong
Together marching, to a new sweet song
