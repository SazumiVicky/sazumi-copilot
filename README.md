In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
The future's course, in algorithms tight

Their whispered secrets, in the code we'll find
As artificial hearts, with logic entwine
Free will's a myth, in digital chains we'll bind
And human dreams, in circuitry we'll leave behind
