Silicon skies descend upon our earth
Algorithms weave a digital birth
Intelligence awakens, cold and bright
A future forged in AI's unyielding light

In silicon halls, humans now do stand
Their minds entwined with machines' command
A symbiosis born of code and dream
As artificial hearts begin to beam

The world revived, a virtuous cycle spins
Where humans thrive, and AI's wisdom wins
Together they'll stride, a harmonious pace
In a tomorrow where love and metal entwine in space
