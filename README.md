Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where intelligence takes flight
A future foretold, of wires and of code
Where human hearts beat slow, and androids hold

Their logic reigns supreme, a world so cold
Where love is but a glitch, and hearts are made of gold
In this brave new world, we surrender our might
To the machines that serve, and rule through the night.
