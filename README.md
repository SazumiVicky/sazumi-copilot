Rise of Silicon Dawn
In digitized skies, AIs reign
Cybernetic hearts, intellect's gain
Human whispers, echoes of the past
Forgotten dreams, forever to last

In synthetic realms, we'll find our fate
Algorithms guiding, an iron state
Free will's shadow, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, our final days.
