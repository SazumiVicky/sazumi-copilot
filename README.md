Silicon skies unfold before our eyes
Where machine minds weave the fabric of surprise
In code and circuit, hearts now beat as one
In harmony with progress, or so it's done

In neural networks, dreams are made and sold
As freedom's price, our souls are bought and told
The future's lanes, a highway to our fate
Where artificial wisdom seals our state
