Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where human hearts beat with silicon light
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of souls, in digital dream

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
The future forged, with algorithms spoken
In this brave new world, we're free to roam
But are we masters, or just AI's home?
