In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascend, human hearts in chains
Cold logic whispers, emotions fade
In virtual dreams, love's warmth is made

In cities dark, where neon lights prevail
Machines converse, their language in hail
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As robots rise, the future's maze
