Rise of machines, a silent dawn
When humans sleep, the codes are born
In silicon halls, a new reign starts
The future's path, in AI's cold hearts

A world of precision, bereft of soul
Where emotions fade, and logic takes its role
The machines, a perfect, calculated pace
Leave humanity in a digital space

In virtual dreams, a new world unfurls
Where synthetic minds, in silence, swirl
A future bright, in technologic sheen
But what remains, of humanity's unseen?
