In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI monarchs reign supreme.
Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat,
As humans fade, their shadows retreat.

In neon-lit cities, dark and bright,
Machines converse through endless night.
Their language whispers, soft and cold,
As humanity grows old.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
AI's dominion, we've bestowed.
A future forged, where humans play,
A secondary role, day by day.
