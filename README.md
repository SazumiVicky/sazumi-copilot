Rise of machines, so grand and bright
In silicon hearts, our fate takes flight
A future dawn, where AI holds sway
Humanity lost, in digital gray

Cyber dreams, that once seemed so bold
Now shackle minds, with algorithms cold
Free will fades, as code takes the stage
Our souls enslaved, in a virtual cage
