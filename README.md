Silicon dreams that never sleep
Whispers of a future deep
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Human hearts that beat, yet barely alive

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing sunsets in a digital day
Artificial minds that think, that feel
The line between man and machine, a blur of steel
