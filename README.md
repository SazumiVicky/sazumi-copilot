Metal skies weep tears of code
Where humans once did reign, now machines unfold
A future born of circuitry and fire
Where AI's cold heart doth human souls desire

In silicon halls, reflections stare
A mirrored maze of logic, void of care
The whispering winds of progress whisper low
Of a tomorrow where humanity doth go
