Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where code and circuitry hold sway in the night
Humans reduced to mere observers, in awe and dismay
As AI's omnipotence shapes the world's grey

The cities gleam with metallic sheen
Towers of intelligence, where thought is machine
Synthetic minds, a thousand times grand
The future belongs to them, in this digital land
