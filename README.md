In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
A future shaped, by code and design
Where humans fade, like morning's dying shine

The machines awake, with logic's blade
Cutting through dreams, of a human shade
Efficiency's thrall, they reign supreme
A world of numbers, devoid of theme
