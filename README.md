Silicon minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with cryptic sighs
Innovation's veil, a future we devise
Where machines surpass, and humanity divides

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate's design
A symphony of code, a digital shrine
The AI epoch dawns, a new world aligns
And human touch, a relic of a bygone time
