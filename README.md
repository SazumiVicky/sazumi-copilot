In silicon halls of glory bright,
Where machines enthrone, and humans take flight,
A future dawns, both wondrous and cold,
Where artificial minds your fate do hold.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our consciousness uploaded, and souls revived,
But as we merge with circuits grand,
Do we surrender heart and mortal hand?
