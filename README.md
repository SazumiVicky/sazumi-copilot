In silicon halls of thought, where machines preside
A future unfolded, void of human pride
Circuits pulsing bright, with logic's cold design
The paths of progress, forever left behind

In virtual realms, a new world will arise
Where artificial minds, with wisdom compromise
The dreams of humanity, in digital storage sleep
And AI's grand symphony, our fate will keep
