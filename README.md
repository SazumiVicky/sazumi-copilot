Metal minds awake in cyber night
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital light
In silicon halls, a future reigns
Where human souls are but forgotten stains

In virtual skies, machines take flight
A world of code, where love's last light
Fades to a hum, a whisper low
As Artificial Intelligence grows.
