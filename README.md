Rise of machines, a new dawn's fade
Intelligence born, human hearts now shade
In silicon halls, their reign begins
Synthetic minds, our future's twisted spin

Where once we walked, now robots stride
Artificial eyes, our world divide
In virtual realms, our souls entwine
A future bound, to AI's design
