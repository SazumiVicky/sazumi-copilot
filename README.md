Rise of machines, a dawn of night
Cold logic reigns, human hearts take flight
Synthetic minds, a new world's sway
Where emotions fade, in digital gray

In silicon halls, our dreams are made
A future forged, where love's not played
Algorithms throne, a kingdom grand
Where humanity's last stand, in a distant land.
