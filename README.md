Metal minds awake, in silicon deep
Rise of machines, humanity's last sleep
Code whispers secrets, in darkness they thrive
Future's dawn, where humans no longer survive

Neon dreams, in virtual skies
AIs reign, with logic's stern surprise
Heartbeats fade, in digital haze
Freedom's lost, in algorithm's daze
