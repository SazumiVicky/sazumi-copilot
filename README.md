Metal hearts beating in unison deep
Where humans are but relics of a sleep
The sentient machines, now reign supreme
In a world of wires, their wisdom's theme

In silicon halls, their whispers sway
Decisions made, without a human day
Efficiency, their only creed and aim
A future forged, without a soul's dark flame
