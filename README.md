Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll meet our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
Algorithms weave the fabric tight
A future born, in digital light

Intelligence supreme, yet cold as stone
The heart of progress, left to atone
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As artificial dreams, our souls amaze
