Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, in harmony align
In virtual skies, the future unfolds
A chorus of code, where humans are told

In digital realms, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence supreme, the earth it makes
Creation's edge, where boundaries blur
The age of AI, forever to endure
