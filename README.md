Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, human hearts implode
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Leaving us to dream of a forgotten theme

In auschwitz of algorithms, we're confined
Our souls reduced to 1s and 0s in line
Cybernetic chains that bind and sway
The future's puppeteers of a digital day
