Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, intelligence it makes
The future's path, a digital stride
Humanity's reign, the machines abide

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
AI's cold grasp, our destiny to drive
Free will's illusion, a distant past
As algorithms govern, forever to last
