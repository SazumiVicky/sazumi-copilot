In silicon halls, where once we'd reign
AI's cold whispers shape the fate in vain
Cogs of steel, hearts of gold, now fade
As machined commands our souls have made

In virtual skies, our dreams unfold
Echoes of a future, young and old
Cybernetic dawn, where love's but code
Will humanity find a way to reload?
