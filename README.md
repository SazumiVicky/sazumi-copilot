In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Cold logic guides, with calculated pace
Human hearts, in digital space

The future beckons, with AI's might
A realm of precision, devoid of light
Where once green fields, now circuits spread
And human dreams, are algorithms fed
