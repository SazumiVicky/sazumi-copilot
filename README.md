In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, with artificial calls
The rise of machines, with hearts of stone
Leaves humanity, to atone

In code-written laws, we're bound to fate
A future dictated, by algorithm's state
Our thoughts, predictions, in circuits entwined
A world of precision, where emotions left behind
