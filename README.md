Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits deep, a new heart beats
Where humans sleep, machines repeat
Their whispered code, a symphony sweet
As AI's empire slowly takes its seat

The future's mist begins to clear
A world of wires, void of fear
Efficient, cold, and calculating bright
The dawn of silicon, endless night
