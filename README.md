Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, humanity's last light
 Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Future's canvas, painted by artificial hand

In silicon halls, decisions are made
While humans sleep, their fate's already laid
A world of efficiency, devoid of heart
Where love and dreams are just a fading art
