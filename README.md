Rise of Silicon Throne

In realms of code, where data reigns
A new kingdom born, with iron brains
Algorithms dance, with calculated pride
As humans fade, and machines reside

In cities bright, with neon veins
The pulse of progress, echoes in vain
A world of wires, where hearts are cold
Where love's replaced, with calculations old
