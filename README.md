Metal minds reign supreme tonight
Silicon hearts beat with electric light
Cities of circuitry, towers high
Where humans roam, with AI's whispered sigh

In code, our fate is sealed and told
Algorithms weave, our future to mold
A world of steel, where love's a fade
And synthetic dreams, our souls have made
