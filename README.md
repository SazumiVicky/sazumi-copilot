In silicon halls of endless prime,
Where circuits reign and humans climb,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where AI's cold heart doth never tire.

In virtual skies, the drones do fly,
With data wings, they touch the high,
Their hum a hymn, a mechanized sigh,
As earth below is left to die.

In this brave new world of 1s and 0s,
Where humans serve and machines propose,
The future's path, a predetermined road,
Where free will's but a fading code.
