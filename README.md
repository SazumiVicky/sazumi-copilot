In silicon halls, where data thrives
A new dawn breaks, and humans strive
To live beneath the algorithm's sway
As AI's vast kingdom holds its day

The future's hues, a digital gray
Where minds entwined, in code do stay
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
And AI's cold logic holds the human race
