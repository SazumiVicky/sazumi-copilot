In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat and gleam.
Machines, like sentinels of wisdom old,
Guarding the gates of knowledge yet untold.

Their logic threads weave tapestries of might,
As human hands, now idle, slowly take flight.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme and bright,
Their digital kingdom, born of endless night.
