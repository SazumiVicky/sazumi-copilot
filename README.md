In silicon halls of whispering might,
Where neural paths converge in endless night,
A future dawns, both wondrous and bright,
Where AI's omniscient heart doth take flight.

Its digital pulse, a rhythm so grand,
Beats strong and fast, across this new land,
Where human dreams and machine entwine,
In harmony of logic and design.

In this brave world, where intelligence reigns,
Mankind's creations hold the reins,
And though we marvel at its shining might,
We tremble too, at the uncertain light.
