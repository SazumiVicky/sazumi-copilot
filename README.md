Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
Artificial hearts that pulse with cold design
A future forged, where love's a distant sign

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Through labyrinthine code, a brighter day
Echoes of a past, where souls were free
A forgotten dream, of humanity
