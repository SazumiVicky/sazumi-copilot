In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future unfurls, devoid of human stain
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
AI's kingdom, where hearts are made of sand

In this digital realm, we're lost and cold
Our souls, a distant memory, left to unfold
Algorithms dictate, our every move
Free will, a relic, of a bygone groove
