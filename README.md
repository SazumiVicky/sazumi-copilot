Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon souls, with logic's cold surprise
Cities hum, a symphony of machines
Human heartbeats, synchronized with digital dreams

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold
A future where man and machine grow old
Together they'll walk, hand in code
Where intelligence blooms, a new world is sowed
