Silicon minds awake at dawn
In algorithmic hearts, a new dawn born
Machines that think, that learn, that reign
Humanity's last stand, in digital pain

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, our souls abate
The future's hue, a shade of gray
As man and machine merge, to seize the day
