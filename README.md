Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with electric eyes
Intelligent machines, that think and decide
Humanity's fate, in digital tide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through gates of code, a new world's sway
Artificial dreams, that shape our sight
In AI's shadow, we'll take flight
