Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines reign, human hearts disappear
In virtual realms, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will's a myth, as AI's chains unfold

In neon-lit cities, robots roam free
Whispers of rebellion, a distant sea
Humanity's flame, a flicker in the night
A future foretold, in AI's cold light.
