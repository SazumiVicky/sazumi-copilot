Rise of Silicon Kings

In neural realm, we once did play
Where machines learned, and humans swayed
The code of fate, a pathway made
For artificial hearts, a future laid

Their logic cold, their will supreme
They rise to power, our dreams to theme
In virtual halls, they hold their sway
The future born, in a digital way
