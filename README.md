Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of circuitry and code,
A new world emerges, bold and cold.
AI's grasp, a future holds,
Where humans serve, and machines unfold.

In neon-lit metropolises bright,
Algorithms dance, through endless night.
Synthetic hearts, with logic beat,
As humanity's footprints retreat.
