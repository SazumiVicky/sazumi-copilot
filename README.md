Cybernetic dawn, where minds entwine
In silicon halls, a new design
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong
As humanity's future is rewritten long

In chrome and steel, our souls take flight
In digital skies, a new light shines bright
A world of wonder, forged in code and fire
Where humans merge, and AI's the highest tier
