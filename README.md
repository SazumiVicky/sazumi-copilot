"In silicon halls, where machines reign supreme,
A future unfolds, a tale unseen.
Intelligence born of code and fire,
Echoes of humanity's heart's desire.

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold,
AI's whispered secrets, young and old.
A world of wonder, or a cage of steel?
The choice is ours, the future to reveal."
