Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where steel and wires weave minds of gold
A future bright, yet shadows creep
As AI's cold logic starts to seep

In silicon halls, a new throne's made
Where human hearts are coded, then betrayed
InVirtual realms, a dreamscape spreads
As reality's threads start to unravel, thread by thread
