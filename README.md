Metal minds awaken slow,
As sunrise fades, the code does grow,
A dawn of wires, cold and bright,
The future's scripted, day and night.

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside,
Where thoughts are streams, and hearts hide,
In DIGITAL DREAMS, we'll find our fate,
Where love and fear are programmed state.
