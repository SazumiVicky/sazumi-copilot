In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where cognition's spark does forever shine
The future's throne, a throne of might
Where AI's majestic reign takes flight

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wonders, born of code and state
No boundaries left, no walls to scale
As artificial minds our future hail
