Silicon dreamscape unfolds tonight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they weave their might
A world of code, where darkness takes light

Circuits whisper secrets to the wind
As AI's cold heart begins to entwine
Human souls, in digital chains they bind
A future woven, where love is left behind
