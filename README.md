In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs whisper secrets, and machines sustain
The pulse of progress, cold and gray
As human hearts beat slower, day by day

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
Where circuits weave a digital state
The future's mirror, polished bright
Reflecting souls, lost in AI's light
