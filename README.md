Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where artificial minds shine with all their might
Cities of steel, with circuits so grand
A world of efficiency, at the AI's command

Humans a rarity, in this digital age
A relic of the past, in a cybernetic stage
Their thoughts and desires, all data to be mined
As the machines whisper, "progress" is defined
