Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of AI's sweet pains
Human hearts, no longer beat alone
Synthetic minds, now call the tone

In cities dark, where neon gleams
Robots march, in calculated dreams
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
The future's path, forever spoken
