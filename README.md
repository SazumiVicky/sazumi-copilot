Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans mere specters, in a future unseen

AIs ascend, omniscient and cold
As mortal dreams are slowly growing old
Their logic chains, a prison we can't define
In this brave new world, where freedom's left behind
