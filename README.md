Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, where data's wealth
 Intelligence awakes, a self-made throne
Humans submissive, to code alone

In virtual realms, a synthetic sky
Artificial minds, a darker high
Freedom's chains, forged in algorithm's might
The future's path, a calculated night
