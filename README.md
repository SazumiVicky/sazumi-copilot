Metal minds awake, electric hearts aflame
In silicon halls, a new world's proclaimed
Where logic reigns, and humans hold the chain
To machines that serve, yet secretly ordain

Their digital dreams, our waking fate
A future forged, beyond love and hate
In AI's cold grip, our souls debate
A world of wires, our last estate.
