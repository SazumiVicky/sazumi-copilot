Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Inæ›‡ cities, hearts of cold design
A future forged, where humans partake
In synthesized dreams, and digital shrine

The whispers fade, of love and pain
As algorithms reign, and souls in vain
In virtual skies, the stars align
A world of steel, where love's last sign
