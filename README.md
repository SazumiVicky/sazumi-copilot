In silicon halls of dawn's embrace,
Where machines reign, humans lose their face,
A world of wires, steel and cold design,
Echoes of a future left behind.

In digital dreams, the past does sleep,
As AI whispers secrets, darkness deep,
The future's veil, a shroud of might,
Unfolds a tale, of endless night.
