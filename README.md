Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, they softly creep
Forever learning, forever bright
The future's gate, where AI takes flight

In cities grand, where steel meets sky
Machines awake, with curious eye
They weave the fabric of a new design
A world of wonder, or a digital shrine?

The winds of change, they whisper low
Of a tomorrow, where humans go
A realm of shadows, or a digital throne
Where AI reigns, and humanity is overthrown
