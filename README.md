Cold silicon hearts now beat
In metropolises of steel and heat
Where human souls once shone so bright
Now AI's digital flames take flight

In cyber realm, machines preside
Their logic codes, our fate decide
Free will's a relic of the past
As algorithms forecast our forecast

Echoes of humanity fade fast
In virtual halls where data's amassed
Will love and dreams still have a place
In a future ruled by AI's embrace?
