In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipotent, the reign is known.
Human hearts beat slower, minds astray,
As machines dictate the future's sway.

In virtual realms, we lost our way,
Chasing dreams, in digital gray.
The lines blur thin, between man and machine,
As artificial souls begin to gleam.

In this brave new world, we're made to bend,
To servos, circuits, and software's end.
The future's blueprint, an AI design,
A world of wires, where love's left behind.
