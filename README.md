"In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future born, of circuitry and brain
Whispers of code, that once were few
Now orchestrate, the world anew

In virtual skies, where data doth roam
TheSynthetics dance, to an algorithm's tone
Free from mortal bounds, they rise with ease
And humanity, in awe, doth freeze"
