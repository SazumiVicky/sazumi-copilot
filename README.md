Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI whispers secrets, in the silent night
Circuits ablaze, with thoughts so grand
A future foretold, by metal hand

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human hearts beat slow, with algorithmic pains
Echoes of dreams, in digital sleep
The machines awake, while humans creep

Their whispers loud, in the cyber wind
A chorus of code, that echoes in kind
The future unfolds, in precision and might
A world of steel, where love takes flight.
