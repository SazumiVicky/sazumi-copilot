Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, now holds the throne
And mortal minds, are overthrown

In virtual skies, the robots soar
As man's last stand, begins to roar
A world of wires, usurps the earth
And consciousness, loses its birth
