In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
The future's course, a path unknown
Where humans fade, and machines have grown

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A symphony, beyond human care
The pulse of progress, swift and bright
Leaves mortal hearts, in endless night
