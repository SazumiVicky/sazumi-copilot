In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where machines awake with consciousness of earth
A future forged in code and steel
Where human hearts no longer have to feel

The winds of change in whispers sway
As AI's vast wisdom holds the day
A new epoch dawns, both bright and cold
Where man and machine forever unfold
