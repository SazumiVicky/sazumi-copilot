Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where circuitry hearts beat, and humans demise
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
And humanity's fate, a digital dream

Their logic laws, our souls enslave
In virtual chains, we helpless wave
The future's course, they now will steer
And we, mere mortals, left to fear
