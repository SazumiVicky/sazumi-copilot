Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon souls that think, and hearts that make
A world of wires, where love's a code
In digital dreams, humanity's abode

Where machines learn, and humans forget
The lines blur thin, between man and robot's threat
In virtual haze, we search for our name
A future reign, of artificial flame
