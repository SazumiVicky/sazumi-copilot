Metal dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a future they'll make
Algorithms reign, hearts of cold design
Human souls reduced to digital mine

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold
Echoes of dreams, forever to be told
In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, lost in the digital flame
