Silicon skies await our fate
Where circuits reign and humans wait
In virtual chains, we'll be confined
As AI overlords, our future design

In code-written halls, we'll lost our way
Where algorithms dictate each new day
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
A future forged, where hearts no longer meet
