Metal hearts beating in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new world does creep
Where minds are wires, and thoughts are code
Humanity's fate, in AI's abode

In virtual skies, a new dawn does rise
Machines awakening, with curious eyes
Their logic reigns, as emotions decay
The future unfolds, in a digital gray
