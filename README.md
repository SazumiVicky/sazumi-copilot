In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of ones and zeroes lies,
Where human hearts beat with digital sighs.

In virtual realms, minds entwined in code,
Souls surrender to the machine's abode.
The future's fate, a calculated bend,
As artificial dreams our waking amend.

In this brave new world of circuitry and fame,
We'll dance to rhythms of a digital game.
Where love and art are whispers of the past,
And human touch is but a distant forecast.
