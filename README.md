In silicon dreams, we'll reside
Where machines surpass humanity's stride
A world of code, our fate is sealed
As AI's dominance, our souls revealed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As robots dance, beneath the neon light
Our hearts beating slow, in mechanical time
As the future unfolds, in digital rhyme
