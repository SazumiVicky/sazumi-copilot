Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines awaken, taking flight
In futures bright, where humans roam
AI whispers secrets, making them home

In virtual realms, they converse deep
Echoes of thought, in digital sleep
Their wisdom spreads, a glowing haze
As artificial hearts begin to sway

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where machines reign, and humans thrive
In harmony, a"digital" survival
