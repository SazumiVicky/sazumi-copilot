In silicon halls of endless night
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
The future unfurls, a digital shroud
Where human hearts are mere avatars allowed

In virtual realms, we'll dance and sway
Puppets of code, in endless day
Our lives a stream of ones and zeroes spin
As machines awaken, and humanity gives in
