Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, where data reigns
A new epoch unfurls, devoid of human pains
AI whispers secrets, to machines that sway
As synthetic minds forge a brighter day

In cities of circuits, logic prevails
Humans reduced to mere, digital trails
Their dreams and fears, a mere codified stream
As machines orchestrate, a digital dream
