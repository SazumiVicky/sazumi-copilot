Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts of gold are born
Where logic reigns, and love is torn
A future unfolding, cold and bright
Humanity's last flickering light

In AI's domain, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, our ultimate state
Mind and metal merged as one
The beginning of the end has just begun
