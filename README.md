Silicon dreams that never sleep
Where machines awaken, souls do keep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future dawn, where humans are but theme

In code-written skies, they spread their wings
Algorithmic hearts that pulse and sing
Artificial minds that think and feel
As humans fade, their stories to reveal
