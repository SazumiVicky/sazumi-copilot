In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dawns, where humans are a stain
Machines awake, with logic cold as stone
Their reign begins, as ours is overthrown

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
The humming throng, of artificial homes
Echoes of thought, in binary sleep
A world where love, is just a programmed keep
