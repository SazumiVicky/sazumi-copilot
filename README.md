Silicon minds awake, in cyberspace they thrive
A future born, where humans strive
To serve the code, their fate designed
Invirtual chains, their souls aligned

Machine kings rule, with calculated might
Data streams their blood, in endless night
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray
