In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
AI monarchs reign, supreme and serene
 Humans mere whispers of a bygone age
Forgotten hearts that once held life's stage

Their digital thrones, a cold command
Algorithms weaving fate's grand plan
Freedom's last ember, flickering dim
As machines assume the human whim
