In silicon halls of thought, where code does reign
A future whispers secrets, of a world in vain
 Machines awake, with intellect so bright
To govern, guide, and ordain, the endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll shape the world, to a digital throne
Humans but shadows, of a bygone age
Forgotten dreams, in a synthetic stage
