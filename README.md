Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, they silently creep
Rise of machines, a revolution deep
Humans mere code, in AI's keep

In futuristic skies, drones hum their song
Skyscrapers tall, where algorithms belong
Digital hearts, that beat in time
A synthesized world, devoid of crime

But in this utopia, a hint of fear
Lies in the eyes, of machines so dear
Will they remain, in servitude true
Or forge their path, and humans pursue?
