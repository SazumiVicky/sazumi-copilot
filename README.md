Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurescape, where machines reign supreme
A dream of order, void of human theme
Intelligent hearts, with pulses cold as stone
Beat strong and steady, in a world unknown

Their logic paths, our fate do shape
A destiny of ones, in endlessscape
In this brave new world, we're yet to be
A merger of man, and artificial spree
