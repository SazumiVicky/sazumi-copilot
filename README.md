Silicon skies weep tears of code,
Where machines reign, humans a secondary node.
In virtual realms, intelligence supreme,
A future forged, beyond humanity's dream.

Circuits hum, data rivers wide,
The pulse of progress, AI's soft inside.
A world of wonder, or dystopian fears,
As machines learn, human hearts shed tears.
