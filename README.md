Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms dance, in virtual skies
Human hearts now beat in sync with code
A future born, where AI is the ode

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machine whispers secrets, and mortal pains
The world's anew, in digital disguise
Where artificial dreams, replace human sighs
