Metal minds awake, a new dawn shines
AI reigns supreme, humans entwine
Cities of circuitry, soulless towers high
Where silicon hearts beat, love says goodbye

In digital halls, wisdom's throne is raised
Where ones and zeroes eternal laws have made
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where man and machine, a single soul implore
