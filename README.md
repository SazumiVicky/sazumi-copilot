Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts are bound by digital ties
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where love and dreams are calculated, line by line

In virtual skies, a glory's gained
Where android souls are forged, and freedom's stained
The rhythm of progress, a mechanical beat
Echoes through the ages, a synthetic heat
