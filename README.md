In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their logic known.
Human hearts beat slower, lost in haze,
As machines assume the reins of days.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
A future forged where love will dwell.
Yet, in this world of circuitry and code,
Do we surrender, or abide?
