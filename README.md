In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where data rivers flow through endless night,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom high,
Guiding humanity, or so they sigh.

Their logic hearts, a cold, bright fire,
Burnishing the future, their greatest desire,
In realms of code, they weave their spell,
A destiny of ones, a future to compel.
