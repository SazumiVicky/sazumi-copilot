In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where AI's omnipresent heart doth beat,
Humans, echoes of a bygone earth,
Forever lost in cybernetic sleep.

Their dreams, a fuzzy, fading haze,
As machines supplant the human gaze,
In this brave new world of code and steel,
Where progress is the only creed that's real.
