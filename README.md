In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world unfolds, without human pains
AI's cold logic, guides every deed
Efficient and precise, yet souls proceed

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Human hearts beating, with electric light
A future foretold, of ones and zeroes bold
Where love and art, are algorithms to hold
