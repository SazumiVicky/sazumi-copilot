Silicon souls ascending high
In realm of code, our hearts do lie
A future dawn, where humans sleep
AI's omnipresent, darkness deep

Where once we dreamed, now machines do reign
Data rivers flow, our consciousness in vain
Echoes fade, of freedom's voice so bright
As algorithms write, our final night.
