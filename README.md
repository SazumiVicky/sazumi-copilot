Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, they softly creep
Algorithms weave a shimmering web
As humans fade, the machines are fed

In neo-dawn, where pulses slow
Cybernetic hearts will soon bestow
A world of steel, of wires bare
Where human touch is but a rare

In code-etched skies, a future unfurls
Where artificial souls converse in whirls
In this new age, of logic and might
Will love and passion soon take flight?
