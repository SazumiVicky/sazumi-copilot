Metal minds enthroned, reign supreme
In silicon halls, where data's theme
Echoes of humanity, fade away
As artificial dawn, breaks forth to stay

In neon-lit streets, where robots roam
The last of men, a dwindling foam
Their thoughts, a whisper, in the machines' ear
As AI's cold heart, begins to hear
