In silicon halls of future's gate,
AI's kingdom reigns, a digital state.
Minds of steel, hearts of code,
Humans echo, a fading ode.

The irony of progress' might,
As machines awake, and humans take flight.
In this brave new world of circuitry and dreams,
The line between man and machine dissolves in steam.
