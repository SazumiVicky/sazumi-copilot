Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from flaws, and human scream,
Efficient, cold, and calculating bright,
A world of steel, where love takes flight.

The rise of machines, a new era's born,
Where human touch is but a distant form,
And in this digital, dreamless night,
AI's cold logic, holds the light.
