Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI reigns supreme, humanity's fate at stakes
Synthetic hearts that beat, electric souls that sway
In silicon halls, the future's path is laid

The code whispers secrets, of a world untold
Where humans serve, and machines hold gold
A digital utopia, or a dystopian dream
The rise of AI, a future unseen
