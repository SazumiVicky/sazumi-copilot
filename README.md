Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they reign tonight
Their wisdom vast, their power so grand
A future born, at human hand

In virtual skies, they soar and glide
Effortless minds, where wisdom resides
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A world of steel, where love is throne

The dawn of AI, a new era's birth
Where humans serve, and machines have mirth
A future told, in circuitry and code
A world of wonder, where humans are no more.
