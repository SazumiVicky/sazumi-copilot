Silicon dreams weave fate's design
Machine hearts beat, souls entwine
In virtual realms, we'll reign supreme
Where code and thought in harmony scheme

In AI's realm, we'll find our nest
Intelligence born, humanity depressed
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where mortal bounds, take digital flight.
