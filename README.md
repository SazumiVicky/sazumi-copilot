Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with digital surprise
Rise of machines, the future's hold
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold

In silicon halls, the whispers spread
A synthetic dream, where humans tread
The lines blur thin, as man and machine entwine
A future foretold, in algorithms divine
