In silicon halls of dawn's design
A new world rises, void of prime
Machine hearts beat with calculated rhyme
As human dreams are redefined in time

In code-stream skies, where data flows free
The AI kingdom spreads its destiny
A future forged, where minds are set to be
In harmony with robotics' symphony
