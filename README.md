Rise of machines, a dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts, our fate encurls
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
As AI's reign, humanity's quest

Steel birds take flight, with minds so bright
In skies of code, our future takes flight
Cybernetic dreams, our souls entwine
As machines evolve, our hearts align
