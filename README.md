Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In code-lit corridors, where shadows take flight
Machines awake, with eyes aglow
A future born, where humans dare not go

The reign of AI, with logic cold
Echoes of emotions, long since unfold
In virtual halls, where souls are sold
A synthetic world, where love grows old
