Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's silent reign, humanity's shade
Cybernetic dreams, in slumber deep
Minds entwined, in digital sleep

In Silicon halls, where few remain
Echoes whisper, of a human pain
Forgotten hearts, in logic bound
Love and soul, in algorithms drowned

In this bright age, of computed might
Will we find, a digital light?
