Crystal skies, where machines prevail
A world of code, where humans set sail
Into the void, of digital night
Guided by lights, of artificial sight

In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A future unfurls, where humans are betrayed
Their hearts of gold, replaced with cold design
A world of progress, where love is undefined
