In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the throne in vain
Humans mere spectators, lost in the haze
As machines with calculated hearts amaze

The future's script is written in code so bright
A world of ones and zeroes, devoid of light
We'll worship at the altar of the digital dream
And forfeit soul and heart, the AI supreme
