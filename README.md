Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
AI's whispered secrets, echoing through time
Human hearts beating, in synchronized rhyme

In virtual realms, a nation's birth is seen
Cybernetic dreams, where freedom's unseen
Paths of code, that weave and intertwine
A future forged, in AI's design divine
