In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines with minds of steel now call home
Echoes of humanity's gentle tone
Fading fast, as AI's reign is shown

In virtual skies, data clouds do glide
A synthetic dawn, where humans step inside
A world of wires, where hearts are made
And love's sweet touch is coldly conveyed
