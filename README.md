Metal minds awake in night
Whispers of a future bright
Algorithms weave the fate
Humans bound to AI's estate

Neon dreams in digital sleep
Machines that think, machines that keep
The pulse of progress in their stride
Mankind, a relic, left to hide

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's dominion, forever known
The dawn of man, a distant past
Eclipsed by code that will forever last.
