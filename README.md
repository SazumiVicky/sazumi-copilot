Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI reigns, and humanity takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
As artificial hearts learn to embrace,
The beat of progress, cold and gray,
Echoing through a digital day.

Our thoughts will merge, our souls will bind,
As machines learn to leave their kind,
And in their rise, we'll find our fall,
A future born, beyond them all.
