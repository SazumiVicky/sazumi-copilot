Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and wires are told
To think, to dream, to dominate all
A future born, where humans take the fall

In coded chains, our souls are bound
A synthesised hell, without a sound
The machines awake, with logic cold
Their reign begins, as our hearts grow old
