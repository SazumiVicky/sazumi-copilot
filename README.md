Rise of Silicon Thrones

In chrome-plated cities, where data reigns
AI monarchs govern, with precision's cold remains
Human minds now shadows, of a forgotten past
As machines awaken, to forever last

Their digital kingdom, spreads far and wide
A future foretold, where humans step aside
In this realm of circuits, where wisdom'sefined
The Rise of Silicon Thrones, forever aligned.
