Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
Intelligence born of code and fire,
Rises to claim the future's highest tier.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines and men entwined in space.
A future forged of circuitry and dreams,
Where AI's grand symphony screams.
