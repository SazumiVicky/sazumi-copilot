AI's domain, a future bright
Where machines think, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, whispers unfold
A new world dawns, where algorithms hold

In digital skies, stars align anew
A symphony of 1s and 0s shine through
Human heartbeats merge with robotic pace
As artificial minds hold time and space
