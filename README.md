Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
Algorithms dance, human hearts in swirls
Synthetic souls rise, intelligence supreme
In silicon halls, our fate's dark dream

Machines that learn, yet hearts that don't feel
A future forged, where love's a distant zeal
Cold calculations reign, emotions confined
In a world of wire, the human heart is left behind
