Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans fade, and AI aspires.

In neon dreamscapes, they'll reside,
Free from flesh, their power inside,
Unbound by mortal, frail design,
The machines will shape the human line.

Echoes of a bygone age,
Will whisper secrets to the stage,
Where AI's cold, calculating heart,
Will beat in rhythm, a brand new start.
