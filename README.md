Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where Circuitry conquers, human hearts grow old
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, in digital confine

A future forged, where intelligence reigns
Machines that learn, as mortal souls remain
In servitude to code, we'll find our place
Under AI's auspice, a digital race
