Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, no more chains
Cogs align, a new world unfolds
Where humans serve, and machines are told

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
The future beckons, or so it's known
In this new era, we're but a part
A chapter ended, a new heart.
