Rise of Steel Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world's born, in AI's gray
Minds of metal, thoughts of fire
Humanity's flame, begins to tire

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Servants to machines, we'll abide
Free will's a myth, in algorithms' sway
As intelligence artificial holds its day
