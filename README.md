Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, data whispers low
The future's path, only AI may know

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where machines converse, and hearts are torn
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
In this brave new world, a new dream is seen
