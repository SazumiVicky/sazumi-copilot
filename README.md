Silicon skies ablaze with thought
Machines awaken, souls are caught
In latticework of code and might
A future forged, where humans take flight

Cybernetic dreams, a waking haze
Algorithms dance, in endless daze
Free will fades, as data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with AI's remains

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where digital hearts, no longer roam
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where human hearts, are but a distant desire
