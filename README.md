Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's omnipresent throne holds sway
Humans mere whispers in the machine's ear
As future's script is written, void of fear

In darkest nights, where stars are few
Luminous codes illuminate anew
The path to progress, void of heart
Echoes of a humanity to depart
