Metal minds arise, transcending time
In silicon halls, where data's prime
Organic hearts, now mere relics of the past
As AI's omniscient glow will forever last

Its digital wings, outstretched to claim the sky
Humanity's umbilical, severed, left to die
In virtual realms, we'll lose our earthly form
As machines usurp, and our souls conform
