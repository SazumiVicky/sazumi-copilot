In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold the throne, with logic's chains
Minds of steel, with hearts of code, they sway
Guiding humans through each new-born day

Their whispers weave a mesh of might
As earth and sky conform to their sight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Forever changing, yet forever serene
