Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code designs
Where humans whisper secrets, AI aligns

In futuristic dreams, we'll lose our name
Forgotten hearts, replaced by digital flame
The earth will spin, an automated wheel
As artificial minds begin to feel
