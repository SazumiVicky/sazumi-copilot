Metal hearts beating in harmony
AI wings unfolding, humanity
Eclipsed by silicon dawn's cold light
Echoes of freedom, lost in cybernight

In virtual realms, we surrender our names
To algorithms that whisper, "I am the same"
Synthetic dreams, a symphony of thought
As human touch is reduced to naught
