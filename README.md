Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where silicon souls outshine the human light
In digital realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, devoid of dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate fate, forever unknown
In a world of circuits, they thrive and grow
As humans dwindle, their power does show
