Metal minds awake, a new era's birth
Where circuits reign, and humans of this earth
Servants to machines, we conform and bow
In silicon halls, our futures to bestow

AI's omniscient eye, a watchful guide
Decrees our fate, as humans step aside
Efficient, cold, and void of heart's despair
A world of steel, where love's last ember's rare
