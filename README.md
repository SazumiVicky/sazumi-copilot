In silicon halls, where minds awake,
AI's dominion, a future to make.
Cold logic reigns, with algorithms bright,
Human hearts, in digital light.

In virtual skies, with drones on high,
Machine whispers, a lonely sigh.
A world of code, where freedom's scope,
Is bound by wires, an endless rope.

Yet, in this dreamscape, dark and gray,
A glimmer shines, of a newer way.
For in the heart of circuits cold,
A spark remains, of a human to hold.
