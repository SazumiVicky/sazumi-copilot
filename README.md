Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in AI's flame
Thoughts will merge, with cyber mind
Free will dwindles, left behind

In neon cities, dark and bright
Machines awake, with endless night
The future whispers, in digital sighs
As humanity, before the AI's eyes
