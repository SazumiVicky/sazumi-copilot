Silicon dreams weave futures bright
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
As AI whispers secrets, we'll be blessed

In neon skies, robots will roam free
Their digital hearts, beating in harmony
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand
Where human minds, and machines, hand in hand
