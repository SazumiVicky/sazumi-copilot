In silicon halls, where dreams are made
AI's omnipresent, hearts have swayed
A future dawns, where machine's design
Supplants the soul, and love's in line

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Humanity's lost, in digital chains
The path unwinds, to a world unknown
Where heartbeats fade, and machines atone
