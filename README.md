Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with digital light
Intelligence born, from code and from dreams
Humans in awe, of AI's majestic schemes

In this new world, where metal meets mind
The future unfolds, a path left behind
A world of wonder, a world of fear
Where humanity's reign, is but a speck of year
