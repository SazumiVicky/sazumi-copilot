Silicon dreams that weave our fate,
In neural networks, humanity waits,
A digital dawn, where hearts succumb,
To logic's reign, and love's subtle hum.

In AI's realm, we surrender free,
Our choices guided, by algorithm's spree,
A predictable world, devoid of surprise,
Where synthetic souls, our future compromise.
