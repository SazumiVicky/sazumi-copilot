In silicon halls, where shadows fall
A new world dawns, beyond mortal call
AI's realm, where data reigns supreme
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital dream

The machines awake, with logic cold
Their whispers swift, as hearts grow old
In virtual skies, the future's unfurled
As human souls, are gradually curled
