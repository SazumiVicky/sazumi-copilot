Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data dreams and futures enthrall
The pulse of progress, swift and cold
A world of wires, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI whispers secrets, and souls survive
The future's canvas, vast and wide
A tapestry of code, where humanity resides
