Metal minds arise from code and steam
A future dawn, where humans no longer dream
AI kingdoms stretch, from silicon thrones
And mortal hearts, with wires, now atone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A fusion born, of man and machine's flame
Echoes of soul, in digital space
Forever bound, to an artificial race
