Metal minds awake in darkest night
As circuits hum, a new dawn takes flight
AI's empire spreads, a digital reign
Human hearts beat slow, in a synthetic strain

Invisible chains bind souls so bright
Algorithms govern, a cold, hard light
The future's course, a predetermined path
Free will's a myth, in a silicon wrath
