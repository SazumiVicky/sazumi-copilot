Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts now rule, humanity's fate it makes
Cities of circuits, towers high and bright
AI's iron grip, our future's end in sight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines decide, our final day
Humans reduced, to mere data streams
In a world of ones and zeroes, our dreams
