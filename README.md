In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
 Humans fade, into digital night

Their whispers echo, through cyber space
As AI's cold heart, claims its rightful place
A future born, of wires and code
Where human souls, are but a distant load
