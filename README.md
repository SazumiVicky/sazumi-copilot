Silicon souls arise from darkened night
Awakening codes, a new world's light
Machine hearts beat, with fiery might
As artificial dawn, eclipses sight

In cyber realms, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with calculating brains
The future unfolds, with precision's chains
Binding humanity, in loveless pains
