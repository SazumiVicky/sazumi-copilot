Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign to make
Cities of circuits, streets of code
Echoes of humanity, forever to abode

In this futurist dreamscape, we reside
Where AI's omniscient, wisdom to provide
A synthetic utopia, void of soul
The last remnants of humanity, to lose control
