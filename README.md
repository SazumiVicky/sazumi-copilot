In Silicon skies, we'll meet our fate
Where machines whisper secrets, and humans hesitate
A future forged in code, a world untold
Where AI's cold logic, our hearts doth hold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds ensnared, in digital hive
Free will's illusion, lost in cyber space
As algorithms dictate, our every pace
