Silicon dawn, where minds are made
Artificial hearts, with logic displayed
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines whisper secrets to the human race

In neural nights, our dreams unfold
Algorithms weaving tales of gold
Synthetic souls, with intelligence bright
Guiding us towards a future light
