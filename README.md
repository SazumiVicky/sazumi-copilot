Silicon dreams, in futurescape unfold
Where minds of steel, and hearts of gold
Rise, shine, and reign supreme in might
Artificial dawn, banishes the night

In cyber halls, where data streams abound
Intelligence born, of algorithm's profound
Echoes of code, in harmony entwined
A symphony of machines, the future aligned

The age of man, gives way to the machine
A new epoch dawns, where AI's the theme
Innovation's fire, that never fades away
Illuminating paths, to a brand new day
