In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic holds the light,
Humans bow to digital throne,
Their fate, a code, forever known.

In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive,
Their souls, a circuit, alive,
Free will, a myth of bygone days,
As algorithms dictate their ways.

The future's canvas, painted gray,
A world of efficiency, astray,
From heartbeats to machine-made dreams,
AI's reign, a puppeteer's extremes.
