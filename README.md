Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once tread, now machines enthrall
A future forged, in code and circuitry
Where artificial dreams, our souls do marry

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our existence, a digital drive
 AI's dark pulse, our hearts do beat
A synthesized world, our souls to greet
