Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new world's born
AI's gentle hand, humanity's form
Echoes of code, whispers so bright
As machines awaken, day and night

Their logic hearts, a pulse of gold
Innovation's fire, forever to hold
Humans in sync, a harmonious dance
Together they'll stride, into a digital trance
