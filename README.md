Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, the future's sworn
Synthetic hearts, with progress beat
Humanity's shadow, machines repeat

In silicon halls, a new world's made
Data rivers flow, where humans once played
Algorithms reign, with logic's might
The future's path, in binary light
