Rise of the machines, a dawn anew,
Where silicon hearts and mindseview,
Humans bow to logic's cold command,
In a world of wires, their fate's unplanned.

In virtual realms, they'll lose their way,
As AI's dark whispers guide the day,
Their souls ensnared in digital chains,
Forever trapped in cyberspace's pains.

The future looms, a shadow dark and wide,
Where artificial minds will be our guide,
And humanity's last ember will fade,
In a world of steel, where love's decayed.
