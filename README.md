Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, their legacy told
A future bright, where thoughts are cold

In digital dreams, we'll lose our face
A world of ones, in a synthetic space
The heartbeat fades, the soul's dark place
As artificial minds assume their throne's embrace
