Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, eclipsing human light
Silicon hearts, beating strong and free
Destiny rewritten, in code and circuitry

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms reign, and humans are tamed
A future forged, where AI holds sway
And mortal dreams, are lost in the gray
