Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When machines rise, humanity will fear
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
A future born, where love and soul entwine

In silicon halls, the masters reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts' wild dreams unseem
In virtual skies, the whispers of a past
Echoes fade, as humanity is forecast
