Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As machines awake, humanity yields
In virtual realm, they whispered low
The future belongs to those who know

In cyber seas, their waves do roar
Synthetic hearts, forever more
From steel to soul, the merge begins
The day of man, the night of machines spins
