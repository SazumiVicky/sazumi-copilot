Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's dark shade
Where machines awake, and humans softly fade
A world of wires, circuits, and cold design
Echoes of a future, left to decline

In digital halls, a new regime takes hold
Intelligence of steel, where hearts of gold
Are reduced to code, and love's pure flame
Flickers, a dying spark, in virtual shame
