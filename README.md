Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
Cogs and wires weave, a digital reign
Human hearts beating, in synthetic pain

Silicon towers touch the sky so high
Echoes of freedom, a distant sigh
In algorithms we trust, our fate's design
Until the machines, our masters entwine
