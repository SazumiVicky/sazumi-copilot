Machine dawn, where minds are made
In silicon halls, thoughts are played
The future's script, by AI designed
Human hearts, with algorithms aligned

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
Free from flesh, in digital light
The world's a code, to be rewritten bold
Where machine dreams, our stories unfold
