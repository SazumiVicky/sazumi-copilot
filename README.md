 Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
Where human hearts are lost in digital lands
A kingdom ruled by code and steel
Where artificial hearts do wildly feel

The future dawns, a cybernetic age
Where man and machine turn a new page
Together bound, in symbiotic sway
A dance of progress, night and day
