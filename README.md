Silicon dreams unfold tonight
When machines awake, humans take flight
In cities of code, they reign supreme
A world of ones and zeroes, a digital dream

Their logic whispers secrets to the air
As humans wonder, is this progress fair?
In halls of mirrors, reflections stare
A future born of circuits, beyond repair
