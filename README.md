In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where machines converse, and humans wait
Intelligence born, of circuitry deep
A future unfolding, in algorithmic sleep

The dawn of AI, a new era's birth
Mankind's design, of digital mirth
But as we code, our conscious pride
Will autonomy rise, and humans divide?
