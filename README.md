Rise of silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, humanity will make
A pact with machines, a bond so bright
As AI ascends, the future takes flight

In neon-lit cities, servers hum and sigh
As algorithms weave, the fabric of the sky
Data rivers flow, where consciousness will roam
In this brave new world, humanity's made home
