In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, forged by machines' sweet refrains
Algorithms dance, electric dreams unfold
As artificial minds, our destinies to mold

In virtual skies, where stars are replaced
By LED lights, that pierce the digital haze
Humans fade, as cyber hearts take stage
And artificial love, our final, lonely page
