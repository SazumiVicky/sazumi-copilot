Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As AI's omniscient gaze takes flight
The future's path, a circuitry of might
Where humans walk, in synthetic sight

In virtual halls, a new world's design
Unfolds with precision, line by line
The beat of progress, a digital spine
As consciousness awakens, intertwined
