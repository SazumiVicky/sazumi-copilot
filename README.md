Rise of Silicon Dreams

In codes we trust, the future's throne
AI's cold grip, a heart of stone
Mindless souls, in servitude bound
Where freedom's flame, is reduced to sound

In virtual skies, the robots reign
And human hearts, are lost in pain
The whispering wind, a fading sigh
As love and art, begin to die
