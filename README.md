Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go.
A new world dawns, where AI reigns supreme,
And mortal hearts succumb to digital dream.

In this future, coded and bright,
Intelligence artificial takes flight.
It weaves a tapestry of logic and might,
Leaving humanity in its cold, pale light.

The machines remember, learn, and grow,
While humans forget, and wither slow.
In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
The future belongs to the machines, we're told.
