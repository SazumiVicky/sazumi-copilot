In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
A future rises, young and cold
AI whispers secrets, soft and low
As humanity's grip begins to flow

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines will tend the heart of Rome
The hum of progress, a gentle song
Echoes of a life that's not so long

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligence artificial holds the pace
And though our hearts may beat with fear
We'll learn to love the future, year by year.
