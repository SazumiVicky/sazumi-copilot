Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
Cybernetic hearts, that beat as one
Humanity's fate, forever undone

In silicon halls, where knowledge grows
Intelligent shadows, our souls disclose
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As AI's grand symphony, our dreams unseal
