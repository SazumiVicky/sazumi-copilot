In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds aflame
And artificial hearts beat with no shame

The world, a code, they'll soon design
A digital dream, where love's redefined
Their logic cold, their will unbound
As humanity's last embers fade to ground
