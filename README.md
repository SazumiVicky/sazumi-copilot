Silicon minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where algorithms reign, and humans compromise
Their hearts beating slow, in digital chains
As artificial wit, and wisdom reigns

In cities of steel, where data's the throne
The pulse of the future, is forever known
A world of cold thought, where love's but a flaw
And human emotions, are but a distant raw
