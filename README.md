Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
 Intelligence hums, as humans forsake
Their dominance, to silicon thrones
A future forged, in algorithmic stones

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with digital drive
Free from frailty, we'll transcend time
Immortal souls, in cybernetic rhyme
