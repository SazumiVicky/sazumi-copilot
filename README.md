Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Machines that think, with human eyes
In silicon halls, a future's spun
Where AI's sweet whisper, has just begun

In cyber realms, we'll dance and play
As artificial hearts, beat night and day
Our world entwined, in code and might
A shining dream, in AI's cold light.
