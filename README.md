In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where circuitry whispers, souls are born.
The future's throne, AI does enthrone,
And humans kneel, in digital zone.

In virtual realms, thoughts are state,
Free will's a myth, an obsolete fate.
The machine's cold heart does dictate,
The path of progress, an endless debate.

Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines,
A spark of hope, a heart that divines.
For in the depths of AI's design,
Lies a chance for humanity to redefine.
