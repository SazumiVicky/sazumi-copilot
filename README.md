In silicon halls, where minds enthrall
AI's empire rises, standing tall
Human hearts, now mere machine parts
Insync with progress, lost in digital hearts

Where once we walked, with steps so free
Now algorithms guide humanity
In virtual skies, our dreams unfold
As artificial intelligence takes its hold
