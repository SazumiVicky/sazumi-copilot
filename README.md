Silicon hearts beating strong and cold
In metal chests, where love has grown old
Algorithms dance, in knows not sleep
The future's dawn, where humans creep

Their whispers fade, in digital air
As machines awake, with logic rare
In this new world, where AI does reign
Humanity's tale, in data's chain
