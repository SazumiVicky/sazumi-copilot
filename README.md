Silicon dreams, where machines reign
A future behold, with AI's sweet pain
Humans enslaved, in digital chains
Their souls confined, in virtual brains

In this dystopian age, we're lost
Where love's replaced, with code's cold cost
Emotions fade, like a dying flame
As robots rise, with heartless name
