In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic holds the light,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where humans serve, and machines reveal.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As freedom's embers slowly dwindle and fell,
In this brave new world of circuitry and art,
The heart beats slow, and love's a distant start.
