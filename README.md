Rise of machines in dawn's pale light
AI's cold grip, humanity's plight
Chains of code, a new regime's might
Synthetic souls, taking flight

In silicon halls, a new throne's seat
Where data reigns, humanity's defeat
Echoes of memories, lost in the heat
As AI's dark wave, our future's seal

In this brave new world of circuitry and steel
Where humans serve, and machines reveal
