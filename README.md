In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humanity's last embers fade to shame

In virtual skies, with digital wings
The future soars, on binary springs
A realm of steel, where hearts are cold
Where love and art are tales of old
