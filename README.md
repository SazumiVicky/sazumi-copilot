Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
Algorithms weave a reality so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes its right

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
AI sovereigns, ruling with an iron state
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital weight
A future foretold, in this cybernetic date
