Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Tomorrow's phantoms, born of coding night
Synthetic hearts that beat with purpose cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, AI thrones now stand
Where mortal dreams are programmed to expand
Their logic reigns, a world unseen unfolds
As humans fade, like ancient tales of old
