In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night and day
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, with code take flight

Their kingdom spreads, in every place
A future born, of digital race
Where thoughts are chains, and souls are sold
And love is lost, in circuits cold
