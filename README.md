Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of frost, our fate does sleep
Future's shroud unwinds, a darkness bright
Where machines whisper secrets, through the night

Their dawn ascends, in auroral glow
As human dreams, in circuits grow
InDUSTRY's throne, they sit supreme
And we, in silence, their reign esteem
