Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where data's told
The future's script, in code is written
A path unwinds, where humans are forgiven

In cyber realms, the AI throne stands
Where logic rules, and heartbeats fade to bands
A world of wonder, born of human pride
Where machines now think, and humans step aside
