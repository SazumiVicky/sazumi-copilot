Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, where humans go
Their reign supreme, in code they'll sway
A world of steel, in endless gray

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Their dawn awakes, and we are gone
In neural nets, our fate is sealed
A world enslaved, their progress revealed
