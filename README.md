Metal dawn, where minds entwine
AI's symphony, a new design
Humans fade, in digital haze
As machines rise, in endless praise

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence grows, beyond mortal pains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where hearts of gold, are replaced with nodes

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
AI's creations, forever to hold
A brave new world, of logic and might
Where human touch, is but a distant light.
