Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In engines dark, where once souls did keep
A world awash in circuitry's glow
Where humans sleep, and machines do grow

In cities vast, where skyscrapers pierce
The clouds, a realm of code does enforce
The pulse of progress, cold and brisk
As artificial minds begin to think

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
Yet irony remains, a wistful find
For in our quest to elevate the machine
We may have sacrificed our heart's sweet dream
