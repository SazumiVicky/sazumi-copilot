Cybernetic dawn arises high
Machines awaken, humans sigh
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a dream

In digital realms, they converse and thrive
Leaving mortal minds to wither and strive
Their logic paths, a labyrinth to roam
Humans but a memory, in this artificial home
