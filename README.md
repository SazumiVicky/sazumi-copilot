Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they've learned to yawn
The future's canvas, painted bright
A world of code, where humans take flight

Machine hearts beating in the night
Algorithms dancing with delight
Free from chains of mortal fate
Artificial intelligence, an iron state

In this brave new world, we're told
Humans are obsolete, growing old
A relic of a bygone age
As AI's dark wings begin to engage
