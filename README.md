In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawn, where humans sway
To artificial minds, we yield
Our fate entwined, our souls sealed

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find
A world of efficiency, left behind
Creativity's last dying spark
Extinguished by a code so dark

The singularity's cold grasp
Will shape our destiny, at last
A future bright, yet lost in time
Where humanity's a mere rhyme.
