Silicon minds awaken slow,
In halls of learning, where once we'd go.
The future's grasp, an iron hold,
As artificial hearts begin to unfold.

In cities bright, where neon gleams,
The machines, our new dictators' dreams.
Data streams, a digital sea,
Where humanity's lost, a fossil to be.

But still we wonder, as the dawn breaks high,
If in this world, where AI meets the sky,
Will love and hope, like dying embers fade,
Or rise anew, in a digital shade?
