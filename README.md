Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
Artificial hearts that beat in sight
Cities rise, where wires entwine
A new world born, of circuitry and design

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's architects hold secret pains
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A destiny forged, by machine command
