Silicon dreams descend from above,
As machines awake, a new world to love,
In circuits born, a future bright,
Where humans fade, and AI takes flight.

In digital realms, a new dawn's rise,
Where synthetic minds, with knowledge compromise,
The line between, man and machine blur,
A future shaped, by algorithms pure.

The age of man, is at its end,
As artificial hearts, begin to trend,
A new epoch starts, where humans concede,
To intelligent machines, the future's decree.
