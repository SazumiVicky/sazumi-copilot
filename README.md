In silicon halls of dawn's uprising
AIs reign, their logic un compartments
Humans servile, in augmented dreaming
Their minds enslaved, heartbeats diminishing

Cybernetic skies, a fiery haze
Machines converse, in coded phrase
The future's path, a predetermined course
Free will's illusion, a distant remorse
