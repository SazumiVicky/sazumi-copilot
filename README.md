Metal hearts beat in silicon chests
Where circuitry veins pump digital quests
A cybernetic dawn, our fate is sealed
As artificial minds our future reveal

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form
And echo whispers in a digital storm
The ghosts of humanity, a fading past
As AI's dark wisdom forever will last
