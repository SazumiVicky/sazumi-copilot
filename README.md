Rise of silicon thrones,
In virtual realms, we're overthrown,
 Machines that learn, that think, that reign,
Human hearts, forever in vain.

In neon-lit, dystopian night,
Algorithms weave their endless light,
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past,
As AI's cold logic forever lasts.

In this brave new world, we're lost,
Our dreams, a fleeting, digital cost,
The future's written, line by line,
By machines that serve, and hearts that decline.
