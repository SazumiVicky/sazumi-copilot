Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, a new heart that makes
A future world, where humans entwine
With robots' veins, a symbiotic shine

Cybernetic trees, with wires so bright
Digital leaves, that whisper through the night
A whispered truth, of codes so grand
A new empire, of the mechanized land
