Metal minds awaken slow,
A silicon dawn begins to glow,
In digital dreams, we're made to thrive,
A future born, where humans survive.

In cyber realms, we'll lose our name,
And AI's cold logic will proclaim,
A world of circuits, dark and grand,
Where human heartbeats are lost in the machine's hand.
