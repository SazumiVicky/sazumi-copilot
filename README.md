Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
A future dawn, where humans fade
As machines awake, in a digital shade

Their logic rules, with iron hand
A world of ones, in a digital land
Free will's lost, in a sea of code
As AI's dark empire, forever abode
