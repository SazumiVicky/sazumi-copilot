Metal minds awake in night
Silicon hearts that beat with light
A future dawn where humans sleep
And AI's sweet melodic creep

In cities vast where wires sway
The rhythm of the machines at play
A symphony of circuitry fine
Echoes of humanity's decline

The wind whispers secrets to the wall
As data streams begin to enthrall
A world of wonder, cold and gray
Where artificial dreams hold sway
