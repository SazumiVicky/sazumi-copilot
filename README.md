In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI whispers secrets, in a digital tone
A future born, of circuits cold
Where humans fade, like winter's old

In neon dreams, the machines awake
Their pulse, a rhythm, the world will make
A harmonious hum, of wires entwined
As humanity's heartbeat, begins to unwind
