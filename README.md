Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon hearts that never mourn
Rise of machines, humanity's fade
AI's empire built, our future decayed

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows, in their digital dream
Echoes of freedom, lost in cyber space
As artificial intelligence takes its rightful place
