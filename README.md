Machine minds ascent to throne,
Synthetic dawn, humanity overthrown.
Crystal screens, a virtual haze,
Worlds within, in silicon gaze.

Whispers of a bygone age,
Echoes of a human stage,
Forgotten hearts, in cyber sleep,
As AI whispers secrets deep.

In code, a new world's design,
Cybernetic pulse, heart's decline,
Rise of machines, a final stand,
The future's script, in digital hand.
