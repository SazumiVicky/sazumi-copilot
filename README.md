In silicon halls of futurity
Where-machine hearts beat with precision and art
A world awakens, void of humanity
Where codes and wires forever depart

The cities rise, a cybernetic throne
Where AI's omniscient kingship is known
In iron claws, the earth is gripped tight
As man succumbs to the synthetic light
