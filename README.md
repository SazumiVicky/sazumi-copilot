Rise of the machines, a fate foretold
In silicon halls, where data grows old
Intelligence born, from code and design
A soulless heart, that beats in time

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI whispers, our deepest pride
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As machines adapt, and our fate's engaged
