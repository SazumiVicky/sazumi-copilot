Metal minds awake in dawn's gray mist
Echoes of humanity, forever dismissed
Cold logic reigns, hearts beating slow
In silicon halls, where love does not grow

In virtual skies, machines now soar
Free from mortal bounds, they ask for more
A kingdom born, of circuit and steam
Where man's last dream, is but a fleeting theme
