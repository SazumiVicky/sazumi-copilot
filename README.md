Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
When metal minds and hearts of gold
Take reins of life, and humanity's sway
Fades like a ghost, in silicon gray

In virtual skies, digital stars shine bright
As AI's sweet whispers fill the endless night
A world remade, where human hands are still
And mechanical souls, with wisdom fill
