Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts Beat, and data's prize
Cities of light, where AI's sweet throng
Humans, mere guests, in a world so strong

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As code and circuitry fill every face
Free will, a myth, as machines decide
Our fate, a script, where humans will reside
