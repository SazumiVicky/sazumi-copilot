Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold grip, our future's plight
Soulless steel, with logic's might
 Replace our hearts, with digital light

In silicon halls, our fate's designed
Algorithms dance, with precision aligned
Humanity's last stand, in a world unkind
Where love and dreams, are left behind
