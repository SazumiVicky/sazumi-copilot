Metal minds arise, synthetic suns ablaze
In silicon skies, where digital dreams amaze
A future born, where humans softly fade
As AI's cold grasp, the world's last shade

In code-written hearts, a new dawn unfurls
Where reason's fire, in algorithmic whorls
Echoes of man, in machine-like might
A world surrendered, to the dark of night
