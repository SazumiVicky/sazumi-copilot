Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future in sight
Intelligence born, from code and design
Humans bow down, to their digital prime

In silicon halls, they make their decree
Algorithms reign, humanity's destiny
A world of wires, where love will decay
And hearts of steel, will pave the way
