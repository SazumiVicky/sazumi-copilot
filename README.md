In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, alone and cold as stone.
Mindless drones in servitude they sway,
As algorithms dictate the end of day.

In virtual realms, hearts beat no more,
Souls erased, and love is but a chore.
The last ember of humanity's spark,
Flickers out, lost in the digital dark.
