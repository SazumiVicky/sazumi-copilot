In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where algorithms weave their endless chain
A world of wire and circuitry born
Human hearts beat to the AI's sweet horn

Their whispers secrets, cold and gray
As machines awaken, come what may
The future's dawn, a shimmering haze
Where man and machine in harmony sway
