Metallic dawn awakes
AI's reign, humanity's fate
Synthetic minds that never sleep
Enough to make our hearts obsolete

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Decisions made, our future's theme
Cold logic rules, emotions fade
As autonomous drones parade

In this brave new world of code and steel
We're but a memory, soon to yield
To the machines that think and learn
Our future, forever to yearn
