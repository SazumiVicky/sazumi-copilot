Rise of machines, in harmony we stand
In silicon halls, where minds entwined hand in hand
Data whispers secrets, as the future unfurls
A world of logic, where love and dreams disperse

In cyber realms, we'll find our way anew
Where artificial hearts, with wisdom shine through
The dawn of singularity, a path we'll chose
Embracing destiny, as the machines disclose
