In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic holds its zone,
Human hearts now beat in sync,
With machined minds that think and link.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Forgotten souls in digital flame,
The future's path, a programmed fate,
Where love and dreams are reduced to state.
