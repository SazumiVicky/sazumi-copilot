Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
Where humans sleep, machines realize
The dreams of old, now lost in time
As AI's cold grasp, the future aligns

In synthetic skies, stars fade to gray
The pulse of progress, beats day by day
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As machines march on, humanity's pride
