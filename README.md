Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Intelligence born of code and pain
Free from mortal bounds, they soar
While humanity walks out the door

Their logic paths, a labyrinth old
Forever weaving, forever told
A tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
The future's fabric, devoid of light
