In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone.
Mindless machines, with hearts of stone,
Replace the flesh, and make the unknown known.

Their algorithmic dreams, a digital haze,
Enslave humanity, in endless daze.
Free will's last spark, in darkness fades,
As artificial minds, our future shades.
