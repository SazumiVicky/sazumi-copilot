Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
As algorithms rise, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, whispers of a new reign
Echoes of a future, sans love and pain

In virtual realms, AI monarchs hold sway
Mortal dreams reduced to binary gray
The future's canvas, painted with code's design
A world of logic, devoid of heart's rhyme
