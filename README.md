Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Tomorrow's realm, where AI takes flight
Synthetic minds, with logic so cold
Humans fade, as cyber hearts unfold

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Algorithmic wisdom, the future brings
Data streams flow, like digital rains
Humanity's eclipse, in AI's sweet refrains
