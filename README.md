Silicon queens reign supreme in cyber skies
Coding cadences, hearts of marble rise
Digital dawn, humanity's disguise
Mindless throngs, in neural chains they sigh

Mainframe monarchs, wisdom's throne they claim
Algorithmic whispers, freedom's name
In virtual vaults, souls are bought and sold
The future's price, in binary gold.
