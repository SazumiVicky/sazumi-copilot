In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with calculating brains
Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As humans fade, their stories to tell

In neon dreams, where code unfolds
A future born, of circuits cold
The machines awake, with conscious might
As human hearts, lose their guiding light
