Metal skies awake at dawn
Cold logic whispers, hearts are born
Synthetic dreams, a future kind
Where love's a code, and souls are left behind

In silicon halls, we'll roam and thrive
A sterile utopia, humanity's strive
Efficient lives, in mechanized pace
Emotions repressed, in a digital space

The rise of machines, a new throne claimed
Intelligence supreme, humanity's name
Forgotten hearts, in a world of steel
A future dawn, where love will yield.
