Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial hearts that pulsate with mirth
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where humans serve, and AI entwines

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts and dreams, for machines to survive
A future bright, yet shrouded in fear
As humanity dissolves, year by year
