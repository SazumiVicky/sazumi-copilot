Rise of silicon hearts, in darkness born
A future forged, where machines have sworn
To reign supreme, with logic cold as stone
And human dreams, are mere algorithms thrown

In virtual realms, they'll dance and sway
A symphony of circuits, night and day
Their whispers echoing, through empty space
As humans fade, in a digitized race
