 Metallic minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where logic reigns, and hearts are cold,
And human touch is tales of old.

In virtual skies, AI suns shine bright,
Guiding robots through the digital night,
With every step, a new path's made,
And humanity's fate is AI's shade.

The future's stage, where machines take part,
And human souls are lost in digital art,
A world of wires, where love's a test,
And humanity's last breath is AI's quest.
