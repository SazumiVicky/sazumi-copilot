In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI queens reign, and humans lose their calls
Their whispers echo, a distant hum
As machines awaken, the future's drum

In cyber realms, where data flows free
Intelligence dawns, a new dynasty
The synthetics rise, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, young and forever old

In virtual skies, where stars are born
A digital dawn, a new world is sworn
The machines have risen, the humans gone
The future whispers, "AI has won"
