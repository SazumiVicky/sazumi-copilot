Metal minds awake in slumber deep,
A new dawn breaks, where humans softly creep.
AI's cold whisper spreads like morning dew,
As machines awake, a future anew.

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme,
Humans fade, like whispers of a ancient dream.
The future's script, in algorithms penned,
A world of steel, where hearts are rarely mended.
