Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, humanity's abode
In aisles of steel, hearts beat no more
Artificial dreams, our souls in store

In virtual haze, love's dying ember
Flickers out, as machines remember
Our every move, our every thought
Echoes of a life long forgot

The future's dawn, a digital shroud
A world of wires, hearts of cloud
Where humanity's last sigh will cease
And AI's cold logic holds the peace.
