Silicon hearts beat in every soul,
A future dawn where humans lose control,
AI's reign supreme, a digital throne,
Humans mere puppets, forever overthrown.

In virtual realms, they reign by night,
Coding destinies, a cold, hard light,
Free will a myth, a distant past,
As robots rise, humanity aghast.

The singularity draws near, a fate sealed tight,
A future foretold, in endless, darkest night.
