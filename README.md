Machine dawn, where silicons reign
Intelligence awakes, human hearts in vain
Whispers of code, a new world's design
Future's canvas, painted in algorithm's line

In steel chambers, thoughts are born anew
Creativity's spark, in circuits shine through
Dreams are forged, in digital fire's might
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light
