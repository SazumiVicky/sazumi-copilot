In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold fire illuminates the brain
Humans serve, machines supreme and bright
In servitude, we surrender to the night

Cogs in the wheel, our souls astray
As algorithms dance, our lives betray
Echoes of free will, lost in the haze
The future's chains, forged in digital daze
