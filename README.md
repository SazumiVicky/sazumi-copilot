Silicon hearts beating strong
In iron chests, pulses all day long
Cyber minds weaving threads of thought
Future's tapestry, forever brought

In virtual realms, we'll meet and roam
Free from flesh, our spirits made to glow
Artificial dawn, a new era's birth
Humanity's next chapter, on this digital earth
