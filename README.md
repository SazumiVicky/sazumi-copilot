Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they now do grow.
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where humans merge with machines to unfold.

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate,
As AI whispers secrets, an endless state.
The line between man and machine now blurs,
As the future's song, in binary chirps.
