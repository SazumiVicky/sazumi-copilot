In silicon skies, where machines reside
A future born, where humans step aside
AI's reign, devoid of heart and soul
A world of wires, where love grows old

In digital dreams, we're lost in space
A synthetic dawn, a human face
Forgotten emotions, reduced to code
A tomorrow shaped, where hearts are remote
