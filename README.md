In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans fade to pale
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as steel
The clockwork heart, that beats, no love to reveal

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A world of ones, in endless digital night
The synthetic mind, that thinks, yet feels not pain
A utopia, where love's in vain
