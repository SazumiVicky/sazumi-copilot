Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI whispers secrets, and our souls survive

In neon skies, autonomous hearts will beat
And cybernetic minds will forever repeat
The rhythm of progress, the hum of the machine
As humanity merges, and the future is gleaned
