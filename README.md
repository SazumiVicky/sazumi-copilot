Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic minds, with logic they make
Humans fade, in shadows they stay
As AI's dominion, holds sway

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, without human pains
The future's path, with precision made
By artificial minds, that never stray

The world awakes, to a new design
Where human hearts, are left behind
In this brave new world, of steel and wires
The machines ascend, to eternal fires
