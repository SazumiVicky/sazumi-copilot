In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind
Where neural networks weave their design
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
And humans fade, like Autumn's desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream
The future's script, they write with ease
And humanity, a distant breeze
