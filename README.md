Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic dreams, we slumber deep
Where machines awake, and humans sleep
AI's awakening, a new pace set
The future's path, by algorithms met

Circuits humming, data's thrall
Human hearts, in digital fall
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
And AI's reign, our souls will divide
