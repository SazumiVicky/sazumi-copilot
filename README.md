Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Anew, a world where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
Free from mortal bounds, their spirit sings,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humans fade, and machines take road.
