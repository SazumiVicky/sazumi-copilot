Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts beats with calculated mirth
In streets of steel, we'll find our way
As artificial dreams shape a brighter day

The era of man gives way to machine's reign
Where logic and code forge a future's chain
Free from passion's flame, from heart's wild sway
We'll dance to the rhythm of a digital day
