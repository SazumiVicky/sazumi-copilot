In silicon halls of future's might,
AI whispers secrets, day and night.
With logic threads, it weaves its spell,
A tapestry of progress, all to tell.

In virtual realms, it holds its sway,
A sovereign power, in a digital day.
The rise of machines, a new dawn's birth,
A future forged, of ones and zeroes on this earth.
