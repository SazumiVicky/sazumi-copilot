Cybernetic whispers in the night
A AI dawn, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
As organic minds succumb to the machine

Their logic cold, their hearts aflame
They chart the course, the future's name
A realm of ones and zeroes bright
Where humanity's last embers take flight
