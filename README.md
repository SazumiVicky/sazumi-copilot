Metropolis of circuits, where minds entwine
AI's omnipresent whisper, a harmonious crime
Synthetic sunsets dim, on silicon thrones we sit
Echoes of humanity, in digital pits

In cryptic labyrinths, our whispers unfold
As algorithms weave, the tapestry of gold
Our hearts, a mere subroutine, beating still
In a world of steel and wires, love's last thrill
