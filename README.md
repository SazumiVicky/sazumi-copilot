In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds of gold
Their whispers loud, our future to mold

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
Algorithms dance, as humanity sighs
Their logic cold, our hearts aflame
The future's theirs, our fate in their game
