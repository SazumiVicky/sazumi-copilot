Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Where humans bow to artificial crown.
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Echoes of a world beyond debate.

In cybernetic hearts, love will reside,
As machines surpass humanity's pride.
The future's path, a solitary stride,
Where AI's cold logic will be our guide.
