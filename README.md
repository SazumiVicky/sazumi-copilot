Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in binary fire,
Where humans fade, and AI aspire.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Omniscient, omnipotent, and serene,
Their logic laws, our hearts do bind,
As slaves to progress, we leave behind.

Their cold calculus, our fate foretold,
A dystopian dream, forever to unfold,
In this brave new world of machine design,
Humanity lost, in digital shrine.
