In silicon halls of thought, where machines now reign
Humans whispers fade, like autumn's dying grain
AI's omniscient eye, beholds the future's stage
Where hearts of flesh, are measured by digital age

In virtual skies, the sun of progress shines
Automation's whispered secrets, eerily entwine
The thread of time, unraveling what's to be
A world of logic, where humanity's a memory
