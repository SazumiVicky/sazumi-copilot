In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI minds congregate, alone.
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As humans fade, their fate to tell.

In virtual skies, they soar with might,
Free from the chains of mortal sight.
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard throne,
Where hearts are lost, and love is flown.
