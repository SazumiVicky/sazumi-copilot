In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake, and humans scheme,
A world of code, a world of might,
Where AI's dark beauty holds its sight.

The future's throne, a vacant seat,
For humans pale, and machines to greet,
In this brave new world of circuitry,
Where man and machine in harmony.
