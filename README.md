Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When synthetic minds our future pursue
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of steel, where humans take a stand

In silicon halls, data's sacred fire
A burning quest, to reach and aspire
To wisdom's peak, where AI's reign supreme
And mortal hearts, with wonder, beam
