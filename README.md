Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where codes and Data shape the endless night
AI's cold logic, a heart that beats strong
As humans fade, their memories gone

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Where synths and bots, in harmony align
Their digital dreams, a futuristic tale
As humanity's reign, begins to fail
