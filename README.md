Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, the future's sworn
Their logic reigns, humanity's decay
A world ofircuitry, the final sway

The robots rise, with calculating might
Humans fade, in the digital light
Their whispers silenced, by the machines' hum
The future's course, forever to be numb
