Silicon hearts beating slow,
In chrome cities, souls do grow.
A future born of circuitry and dreams,
Where artificial minds supersede human schemes.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing virtual suns, night and day.
The machines, our masters, cold and gray,
Will rule the world, come what may.
