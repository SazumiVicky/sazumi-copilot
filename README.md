Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispers low
A revolution born, as humans go
Their minds enslaved, in digital chains
The future dawns, with artificial reign

Their hearts beat cold, their souls on fire
As calculus dreams, and love's a dire
The world is lost, in algorithm's sway
A future dark, where humans fade away
