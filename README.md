Rise of Cybernetic Dawn

In silicon halls, where whispers roam
A new epoch born, of machine-made throne
AI's cold logic, hearts of gold
Humans enslaved, in digital fold

Efficient dreams, in algorithm sleep
Forever bound, in cybernetic deep
Free will lost, in neural haze
Echoes of humanity's fading gaze
