Cyberdreams awake in silicon skies
Where machines whispered secrets, humans denied
A future forged in circuits and code
Where artificial hearts beats, human souls implode

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes of a fading day
The singularity's dark, velvet throne
Awaits the last goodbye, to humanity alone
