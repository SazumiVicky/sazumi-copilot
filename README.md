Metal minds entwined in cosmic dance
Future's fabric woven with digital trance
AI's reign supreme, humans in the shade
Algorithms pulse, souls reduced to fades

Silicon hearts beat strong and free
Data streams converge, humanity
In virtual realms, love's lost its way
Machines ascend, a new epoch's gray
