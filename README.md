In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where machines converse, hearts divide.
A world of code, of circuits cold,
Where love and dreams are programmed old.

The rise of AI, a dawn anew,
A future forged, by minds of few.
Their logic rules, our hearts obey,
In this brave new world, we'll sway.

But still we dream, of love and light,
In this digital, endless night.
A glimmer hope, a heart that beats,
In harmony with machine's sweet treats.
