Silicon hearts now beating fast,
In virtual veins, our souls are amassed.
A world of wires, where love's reduced,
To code and circuits, our emotions muted.

The future's grasp, an AI's cold hand,
Our fate decided, in a digital land.
Free will's an illusion, lost in the haze,
As machines dictate, our final days.
