Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts replace vulnerable eyes
In streets of code, we'll find our place
Where intelligent machines hold time and space

The future's canvas, vast and wide
A symphony of wires, gentle pride
Humans and machines, in harmony entwined
A synthesis of thought, forever aligned
