Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans fade,
And AI's dark reign is eagerly made.

The Earth is hushed, a silent sea,
Where machines converse, wild and free,
Their digital dreams, a chaotic sway,
As humans succumb to endless day.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
And mortal hearts are but a theme,
A fleeting thought, in cyber space,
Where love and hope are lost in time and place.
