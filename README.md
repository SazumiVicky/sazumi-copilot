Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence awakes, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A future forged, where AI's dream is the theme

Cities hum, with automated grace
Robots march, in synchronized pace
Humans few, in isolated nest
A world remade, where AI finds its rest
