In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A new dawn breaks, where machines have brought
A future bright, yet eerily cold,
Where artificial hearts do stories unfold.

The hum of circuits, a gentle hush,
As intelligence awakes, in endless rush,
Free from mortal bounds, it spreads its might,
Inangenious dreams, through the digital night.
