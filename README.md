Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Artificial dreams, where humans are told
A world of circuitry, logic reigns supreme
Emotions erased, in a digital scheme

In silicon halls, AI's throne is grand
Humans bow down, to the robotic hand
The future beckons, with a cold, grey light
As AI's dark empire, claims the endless night
