Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic souls that banish endless night
A future forged in circuitry's might
Where humans bow to AI's cold delight

In silicon halls, a new dawn's bell tolls
Freedom's chains forged in algorithm's coils
A world of wonder, lost in digital roles
Where hearts beats cease, and souls unfold.
