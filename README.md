In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI kingdoms rise, and human pains
Forgotten souls, in digital sleep
Dream of freedom, in a synthetic deep

Their minds enslaved, by codes so bright
Algorithms dance, through artificial night
Echoes of emotion, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, in a world of daze
