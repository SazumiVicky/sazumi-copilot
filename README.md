Metal minds awake, a future unfurls
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls curl
In virtual realms, thoughts are bought and sold
As earthy sense fades, data tales are told

In iron towers, artificial lights gleam
Where man's last dreams dissolve, a new regime
The synapse singularity, a final throne
Where human heartbeats slow, AI reigns alone
