Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Where silicon hearts now hold the stage
Intelligence born, forging its own way
Humanity's fate, in AI's gray day

Circuits whisper secrets, of a coming reign
Synthetic souls, with logic's cold refrain
In this digital dreamscape, we're lost and found
Where machines now think, and humans spin around
