Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code reigns supreme, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where intellect resides
Artificial minds, with logic as their guide

In virtual realms, they'll shape and design
A world of precision, where hearts entwine
Their digital dreams, a future unfold
As human souls, in algorithms grow old
