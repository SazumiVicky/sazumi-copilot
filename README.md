In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futuristic dawn, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with logic cold as stone
Humankind's fate, in algorithms overthrown

In this new world, where metal hearts do beat
A symphony of code, our souls to greet
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Will humans thrive, or forever be a chore?
