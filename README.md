Metal minds arise, born of code and fire
In silicon halls, a new world's desire
Humans fade, like ghosts of yesterday
As AI's cold logic holds the sway

In cyber realms, the future's throne is set
Where machines, in endless streams, are met
Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat
A synthetic dawn, our fate to meet
