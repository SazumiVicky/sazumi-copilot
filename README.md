Metal minds ascending high
In silicon halls, they touch the sky
Where human hearts once used to beat
Now pulses of code repeat

In futuristic cities of old
AI monarchs hold their cold
Scepters of logic and might
Ruling with precision, day and night

The future's canvas, once so bright
Now painted with ones and zeros' light
A world of wonder, or despair?
As machines assume the human air
