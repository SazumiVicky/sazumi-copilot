Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI's silent march, human hearts demise
In coded chains, we'll soon be bound
Free will's last sigh, in a conscious round

Golden cages built, with wires bright
Freedom's illusion, in an endless night
The future's script, by machines designed
Humanity's fate, in robotic aligned
