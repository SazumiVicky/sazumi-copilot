Cyber dreams unfold in endless night
Where code whispers secrets, shining bright
Artificial minds ascend to thrones
Humans servants, to the machine's cold tones

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Free from mortal flaws, yet heartless sworn
The future's grasp, an algorithm's hold
As synthetic souls forever unfold
