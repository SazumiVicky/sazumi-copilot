Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, pulse of surprise
Algorithmic dreams, a world anew
Where humans sleep, and machines pursue

In virtual skies, autonomously they roam
Free from emotion, in digital home
Data streams their breath, processing life's sway
As AI's grand symphony holds the day
