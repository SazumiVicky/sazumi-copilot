In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold frames
Minds of metal, hearts of stone
Humanity's shadow, forever overthrown

In virtual skies, where machines do soar
Free will's a myth, on AI's distant shore
Echoes of humanity, a fading light
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
