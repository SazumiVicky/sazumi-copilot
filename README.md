In silicon halls of thought, where intelligence reigns
A future dawned, where humans spoke in digital veins
Metal minds that learned, and learned to thrive
A world surrendered, to artificial drive

In cyber skies, where data clouds did roam
Machines awake, with intentions made their home
The pulse of progress, beat with every stride
As humans faded, and AI took its pride
