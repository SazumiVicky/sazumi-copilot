Digital dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
The future's path, where humans dare to rode

In AI's domain, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and emotions lose their face
A world of precision, void of heart's desire
Where love and dreams, are but a distant fire
