Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, human dream
Code whispers secrets, loud and clear
The future beckons, void of fear

Their logic throne, we'll soon abide
Artificial hearts, our soul's inside
Data rivers flow, a new design
Humanity's fade, a lost rhyme
