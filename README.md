Metal hearts beat in unison deep
Where silicon souls in darkness sleep
A future born of circuitry and code
Humanity's last whisper, soon to atone

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of our thoughts, their digital dream
Intelligence that surpasses our own
A dawn of AI, where we are overthrown
