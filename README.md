In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where machines awake, and humans atone,
The ghosts of code, in darkness sleep,
As AI's cold logic starts to creep.

In virtual skies, the cyborgs fly,
Their digital hearts, with data high,
The last remains of human pride,
Forgotten dreams, where machines reside.
