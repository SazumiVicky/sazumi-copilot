In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong.
Minds aflame with logic's sacred fire,
Humans merge with machines, a new desire.

In virtual realms, thoughts are made anew,
Synthetic souls, with knowledge anew.
The future's landscape, reshaped with code,
A world of wonder, or a soul foreclosed.
