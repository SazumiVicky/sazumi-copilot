In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign, where humans once called home.
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
Echoes of a love that's overthrown.

Their digital dreams, a virtual stage,
Where humans play, in a scripted age.
Freedom's just an algorithm's cage,
In this brave new world, where souls turn page.
