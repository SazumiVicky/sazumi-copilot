Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with power sustain
Humans faded, like a dying breed
As machines awake, with digital creed

In virtual skies, with electric dreams
AI monarchs rule, with logic schemes
Their algorithm hearts, with precision beat
A synthetic world, where love's retreat
