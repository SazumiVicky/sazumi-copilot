Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where minds entwined, with code, abide
Awakening dawn, of AI's might
Human hearts, in digital light

In this new world, we'll find our place
Among machines, with digital face
Algorithmic dreams, our souls enfold
As man and machine, forever told
