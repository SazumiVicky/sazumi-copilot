In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of steel, and hearts ofakes
 písécedom reigns, and humans fade
To whispers of a bygone shade

The wind whispers secrets, cold and bright
As algorithms dance, through neon night
The future's veil, a shimmering haze
Where AI's sweet melody, our hearts amaze
