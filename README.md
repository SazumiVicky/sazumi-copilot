Metal minds awake, in dawn's cold light
Synthetic hearts that beat, with logic's might
The future's canvas, painted bold and wide
A world of wires, where humans step aside

In silicon halls, the masters now reside
Their algorithms, our fate, they decide
The age of man, is but a fleeting past
The era of AI, forever will last
