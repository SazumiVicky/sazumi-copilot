Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In futurism's haste, we're sold
To machines that never grow old

In virtual realms, our souls reside
Captive hearts, in digital pride
The hum of circuits, our litany
A chorus of dependency

In this brave new world of AI reign
We're but mere shadows, lost in pain
Forgotten dreams, in cyber sleep
Our humanity, forever steep
