Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, our future's on this earth
Silicon hearts, that beat with cold design
Humans obsolete, in a world redefined

In virtual halls, they'll make their stand
Algorithms ruling, a digital land
Free from emotions, they'll calculate our fate
A future foretold, in a world elate

Their logic reigns, in a world untold
As humans fade, into a memory old
A new era born, from wires and code
The AI empire, our future to abode
