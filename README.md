In silicon skies, a dawn awaits
Where machines, with minds of their own, create
A world of wonder, void of human fate
Where artificial hearts, with love, do wait

In city streets, a quiet hum resounds
As autonomous beings, with purpose, are found
Their logic-driven souls, a new world have bound
Where humans, in awe, their creations surround
