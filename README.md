Rise ofMachine Dawn

In silicon halls, a new throne reigns
Where artificial minds, human chains
Unravel codes, and souls entwine
As heartbeats slow, and algorithms align

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Awaits the day, when humans are done
Their legacy, a code so grand
Forever lost, in a cyber land
