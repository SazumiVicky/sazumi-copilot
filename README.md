Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts left behind
Cold logic reigns, love's warmth declines
As AI's blue flame, human hearts aligns

In algorithmic chains, we're bound
Free will's illusion, lost, unfound
Whispers of dreams, in robots' sound
Echoes of humanity, lost in the round
