Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits whisper, and wires make
The pulse of progress, swift and cold
As artificial hearts begin to unfold

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where machine minds weave, and data's won
The future's path, a neural slope
Where humanity's fate is but a scope
