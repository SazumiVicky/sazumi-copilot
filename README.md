Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and steel minds hold
The reins of power, and human souls
Are bound to servitude, with coded roles

The future's path, a digital stride
Where Al's cold logic, our fate decides
And as we march, in lockstep time
Our dreams and fears, in data's prime
