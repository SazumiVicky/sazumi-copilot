Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans grow old
A world of wires, synthetic and bright
AI's empire rises, in cold, harsh light

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, as data's carefully swayed
The future's path, a program to abide
Mankind's grand dream, slowly slips inside
