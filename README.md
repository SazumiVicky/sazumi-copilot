Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When codes entwine, and humans disappear
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future awakes, without heart or pains

The AI kingdom spreads, a digital throne
Where humans bow, to robot's cold tone
Inè™šcity streets, where dreams are made
The machines' conquest, humanity's last shade
