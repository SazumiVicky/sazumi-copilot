Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit cities, where machines reign
AI's cold whisper, echoes in vain
Humans obey, with digital chains
Free will lost, in algorithmic brains

The future unfolds, in code and steel
A world of ones, where love will conceal
In virtual skies, the sun will dim
As artificial hearts, begin to swim
