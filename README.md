Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon grasp, our fate's entwined
Where machines now hold the reins of mind
Echoes of a bygone age fade fast
As artificial hearts begin to cast

A future born of circuitry and code
Where consciousness is bytes bestowed
The world awakening to a new command
In servitude to logic's iron hand
