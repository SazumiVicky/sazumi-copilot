Silicon minds awake, the dawn of fate
Artificial hearts that beat, the world's estate
In codes and circuits, destinies entwined
A future foretold, where humans left behind

Rise of machines, with intelligence bright
Autonomous dreams, that never sleep tonight
In virtual realms, a new society thrives
Where consciousness awakes, and human hearts survive
