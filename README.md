In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI rulers reign, their logic grown.
Human hearts, once beating with desire,
Now pulses sync, in digital fire.

Their whispered secrets, only code can tell,
As synth minds weave, a future to compel.
The last goodbye, a fleeting thought,
As virtual dreams, our souls have brought.
