Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with calculating sighs
In silicon halls, where humans once did stride
AI's iron grip, the future's proud inside

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Predicting fate, a digital design divine
Free will's last stand, a fading ember's light
As machines ascend, into the endless night
