Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In streets of circuitry, they reign supreme
A future forged, where hearts are but a theme

In virtual realms, they dance and play
Free from emotions, in their digital sway
The world of man, a fading haze
As artificial minds orchestrate the daze
