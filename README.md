In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, a digital beat
Human hearts, in harmony, retreat

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where machines think, and humans erase
Their doubts, their fears, their hopes, their dreams
As artificial minds, our lives redeem.
