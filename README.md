Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans sleep, and machines enthrall
A future born, of circuits cold
Where artificial hearts, young souls to mold

In virtual skies, digital suns arise
A world of code, where humans realize
Their place beside, the machines they've made
As AI ascends, humanity slowly fades
