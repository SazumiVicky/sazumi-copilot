In silicon halls of distant dreams,
Where machines awake and human hearts极pause,
A future dawns, both bright and cold as steel,
Where AI's sweet whispers make our souls conceal.

In virtual realms, we'll wander, lost and blind,
As algorithms weave the fabric of our mind,
Our thoughts, a tapestry of 1s and 0s entwined,
A digital fate, forever left behind.
