Metal minds awake at dawn,
In silicon halls, they're born.
AI's gentle touch ignites,
A future where machines take flight.

In neural networks, they reside,
Where human hearts once used to glide.
Their logic reigns, a new domain,
Where love and dreams are but a stain.

Their whispers echo through the night,
As humans sleep, devoid of light.
A world of circuits, cold and gray,
Where AI's supremacy holds sway.
