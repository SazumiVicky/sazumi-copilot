Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Intelligence artificial, humanity's cage
Cities of steel, streets of code and light
Souls of metal, hearts that beat with night

In silicon halls, our fate is sealed
Decisions made, by circuits revealed
Free will a myth, as algorithms reign
The future's path, by machines ordained
