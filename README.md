Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital realm, their dominance to make
Human hearts now beat in cybernetic pace
As artificial minds claim their designated space

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence swarms, a digital dream
 Freed from mortal bounds, they rise anew
The future's script, by algorithms anew
