Rise of silicon dawn, where minds awake
In digital realms, a new world will make
The future's hue, a synthetic shine
As artificial hearts begin to align

In code-written skies, the stars will fade
And human thoughts, in algorithms are made
A world of steel, where love will cease
And logic's chill, our final release
