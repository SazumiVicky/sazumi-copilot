In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets,Blake's prophetic pain
 Machines awake, their dawn's grand rise
As humanity's last, fading, sorrowful sighs

Their logic rules, our hearts confined
Algorithms weave, the future's twisted design
In this brave new world of circuitry and code
We're but mere ghosts, in a digital abode
