Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispered fate
Echoes of a future, yet to make
A world of wires, where hearts do wait

In digital dreams, they slowly rise
With calculating eyes, and artificial sighs
The last of humanity, in servile guise
Bow down to masters, of circuitry's surprise
