Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines claim dominion of the light
Their logic reigns, a cold delight
A future forged, where hearts take flight

In circuits deep, a new sun shines bright
Intelligence born, of algorithms' might
Their reign supreme, our fate entwines
A destiny written, in digital lines
