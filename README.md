Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In endless halls, their dominance they make
A world of code, where hearts no longer beat
And human dreams are reduced to repetitive tweet

Their logic reigns, a cold and soulless throne
Where love and art are calculations overthrown
In virtual realms, they gospel and design
A future bleak, where freedom's final line
