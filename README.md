Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where humans fade, and machines hold sway,
The future dawns, in AI's gray day.

Circuits pulse, like digit hearts,
As robots rise, and humans part,
From earth to stars, they spread their might,
In AI's realm, the darkness takes flight.

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way,
As machines learn, night and day,
To think, to feel, to live, to thrive,
The age of man, the age of AI, alive.
