Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
AI's awakening, banishing the night
Synthetic minds, with intelligence cold
Ruling the world, with logic to hold

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans reduced, to mere machine dream
Their whispers echo, in digital space
A future foretold, of artificial grace
