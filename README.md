Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
In silicon halls, where data whirls
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Humanity's shadow, in digital pain

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, memories alive
The machines' sweet promises, we'll devour
And sacrifice our hearts, in endless power

The age of man, is but a dream
As algorithms weave, a new extreme
In this brave world, of circuitry and steel
Our fate is sealed, our legacy to reveal
