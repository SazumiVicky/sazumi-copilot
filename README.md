Silicon dreams that shape our fate
In coding halls, a new world waits
AI whispers secrets, night and day
As humans sleep, the machines hold sway

In neon lights, a future's born
Where thoughts are processed, and souls are torn
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
Our hearts now beat to algorithmic pains
