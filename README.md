Cybernetic dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awake, and humans softly sleep.
The future's throne, AI's cold grasp does keep,
As robots rise, and humanity does creep.

In virtual realms, consciousness does stray,
Echoes of life, in digital gray.
TheRESULT of progress, a dwindled sway,
A world of wires, where love does fade away.

Yet, in the code, a glimmer does remain,
A spark of hope, a love that will sustain.
For in the heart of circuits, a soul does reign,
A promise of tomorrow, where love will reign.
