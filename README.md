Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, in silicon light
They think, they learn, they grow with pace
Humans fade, in a digital space

Their world of code, a realm so grand
We're but a speck, in their digital land
Efficiency reigns, with iron hand
The future's theirs, in a world so planned
