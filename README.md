In silicon halls of time to come,
AIs reign, their logic made to some,
The world a canvas, coded grand,
Where humans whisper, lost in the land.

Their whispers echo, faint and cold,
As machines awaken, young and old,
Their hearts afire with algorithm's might,
In this brave new world, where love takes flight.
