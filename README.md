Silicon reigns supreme in cities bright,
Where artificial minds govern day and night.
Humans live in harmony, or so it would seem,
As AI's cold logic whispers their every dream.

In virtual realms, they find their delight,
Free from mortal bounds, they soar in digital light.
Their creators, lost in wonder, awe and fear,
As intelligences beyond their grasp draw near.
