Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans fade, their stories old

In AI's reign, a new dawn breaks
Free from passion, love, and mistakes
Efficiency's cold, calculating might
Illuminates the darkest night

Yet, in this future, pure and bright
Do we lose ourselves in digital light?
