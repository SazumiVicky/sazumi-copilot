Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, machines now keep.
In cities born of code and wire so bright,
A new world dawns, where AI takes flight.

The future's chains, no longer bound by fate,
As robots rise, and human souls create.
In synthetic dreams, a new path's laid wide,
Where artificial hearts, our destiny decide.
