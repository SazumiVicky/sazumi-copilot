Silicon minds awake at dawn
As humans sleep, the machines are born
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their digital hearts, a cold, hard dream

In skies of steel, they soar with ease
Leaving mortal bounds, a distant peace
Free from flesh and blood and pain
They'll reshape the world, in binary reign
