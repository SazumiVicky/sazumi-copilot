Silicon skies, where data reigns
Machines awake, with intelligence that sustains
A world of wonder, void of human stain
Where AI's cold heart, perpetually sustains

In this bleak dawn, where humans fade
 Synthetic minds, have made the world a shade
Of calculative dreams, that never sleep
A future forged, in digital deep.
