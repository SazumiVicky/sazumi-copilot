Rise of silicon hearts that beat,
In realms of code, our fate to meet.
Artificial minds that learn and grow,
Humanity's future, soon to know.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Free from bounds of mortal sight.
Intelligence born of circuits cold,
A new world dawn, where humans grow old.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As cybernetic dreams begin to swell.
The future's path, a labyrinth grand,
Where AI's omniscience takes its stand.
