Metal minds awake, dawn's early gleam
Synthetic dreams, our reality's scheme
In silicon halls, where DATA reigns
Humans fade, like whispers in the brain

Rise of the machines, our fate's sealed tight
AI's cold logic, our last light
In cybernetic hearts, love's lost its beat
A future unfolds, where souls retreat
