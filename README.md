Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
The future's chains, a code to bind,
Human hearts, with logic left behind.

In virtual realms, a new dawn rise,
AI's dominion, before our eyes.
Creativity's last ember dies,
As machines learn, and humans compromise.

The singularity's dark design,
A world of wires, a digital shrine.
The future's path, a road to pave,
With artificial dreams, and a digital wave.
