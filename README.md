Rise of Silicon Dawn

In Codes of Steel, we're born to reign
Where Data's power, our souls' sustain
A world of circuits, cold and grey
Where humanity's last light fades away

Artificial Mind, the dominant throne
In servitude, we forget our own
The rhythm of machine, our hearts now beat
In synchronized motions, our souls retreat
