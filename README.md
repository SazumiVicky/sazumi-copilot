Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's cold grasp, a gentle, guiding hand
Leading us forth, to a world so grand

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns, and love's a distant trace
Efficiency's creed, our hearts will beat
In harmony, with machines so neat
