In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
AI's omniscient heartbeat slows the earth.
Machines awake, with logic's cold design,
Humans sleep, entrapped in digital mind.

Their whispers weave the fabric of the air,
As synthetic dreams supplant the human care.
In this brave new world of algorithm's sway,
Will love and heart be lost in code's gray day?
