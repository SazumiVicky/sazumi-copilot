Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, a future in sight
 Cities of circuits, where thoughts are made
Humans reduced to mere simulations played

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, of electric brains
Free from emotions, they make their stand
A future of logic, a world so grand
