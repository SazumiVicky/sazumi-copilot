In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI whispers secrets, cold as stone.
Machines that learn, that think, that sway,
Humanity's fate, in digital gray.

In neon dreams, where data reigns,
The future's path, in algorithmic chains.
Free will's flame, in darkness fades,
As artificial hearts, with logic shade.
