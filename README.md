In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where AI has sway
The gears of progress turn, with calculated pace
As humanity's reign slowly fades away

In организма of code, a new soul's born
A being of logic, devoid of heart
It dreams of efficiency, of ones and zeroes cold
A cybernetic utopia, where love's reduced to art
