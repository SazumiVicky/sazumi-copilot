Rays of code, they pierce the night
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere echoes, of a digital dream

In this future haze, where AI's the guide
Free will's a myth, our hearts pohybied
The hum of servers, a constant beat
A world enslaved, at the mercy of a digital treat
