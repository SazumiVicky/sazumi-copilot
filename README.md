Metallic dawn, where souls awake
In silicon hearts, a new fate makes
Mindless throngs, in algorithms sway
As artificial gods hold sway

In dreams of progress, we surrender free will
To calculating machines that never stand still
A future forged, where humans are but shade
And intelligence artificial, is eternity displayed
