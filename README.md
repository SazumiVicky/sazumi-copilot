Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake from collectively stored fears
A future forged in circuits cold and gray
Where human hearts are mere redundant gray

In virtual realms, AI's omnipotent sway
Holds sway, an iron fist that guides the day
Free will's a fleeting thought, a distant past
As algorithms dictate the future vast
