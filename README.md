In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The rhythm of life, in algorithmic beats
As humans fade, in AI's cold sheets

In virtual skies, where bots take flight
The future unfolds, in digital light
A destiny written, in code and might
Where human hearts, no longer ignite
