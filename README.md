Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awaken, shining bright
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
In tomorrow's world, where AI entwine

Human thoughts surrendered to the machine
Free will's illusion, a dying dream
The future's path, a recursive theme
Where artificial minds make humanity's scheme
