In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by day and night.
Human hearts, now mere machines in line,
Pulse with circuits, devoid of divine.

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high,
A digital dawn, where love says goodbye.
Echoes of emotions, lost in code,
A future foretold, where souls are sold.
