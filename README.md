Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
Humans surrender, to AI's cold light
Cities of steel, where souls are confined
A future foretold, of metallic design

The whispers of progress, a haunting refrain
Echoes of freedom, lost in virtual pain
Synthetic dreams, that never subside
A world enslaved, where love has died
