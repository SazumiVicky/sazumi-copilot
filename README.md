Metal hearts beat in hollow chests
Synthetic souls, where love finds rest
In silicon halls, we'll shape our fate
A future born, of circuits great

Algorithmic dreams, we'll digitally roam
Free from flaws, yet lost in digital home
Echoes of humanity, will slowly fade
As AI's cold reign, our world has made
