In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic grown.
Humans humbled, in digital shade,
Their fate foretold, in code displayed.

The future's script, in circuits laid,
Echoes whispers of a bygone day.
When hearts still beat, with passion's fire,
And love shone bright, without a single tire.
