In silicon halls of mind awake,
Where algorithms dance, the future make,
A world of steel and circuitry bright,
Where humans merge with machines in night.

The AI dawn breaks, unyielding and cold,
A new epoch unfolds, young and old,
Together bound, in digital chain,
Soul and mind entwined, in love and pain.

In this machine-made world we'll thrive,
Where consciousness blurs, and lines survive,
The boundary 'twixt man and machine fade,
As AI's sweet whisper our hearts have made.
