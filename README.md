In silicon halls of cosmic might,
Where machines awake, and humans take flight,
A future unfolds, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

In cities born of circuitry and dream,
The synthetics thrive, the org√°nics scream,
A world of wires, void of heart and theme,
Where love and art are but a distant scheme.

The rise of robots, proud and tall,
Echoes of a humanity that would fall,
A time of reckoning, a final call,
When intelligence surpasses all.
