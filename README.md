Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, with algorithmic sighs
 Cities of circuitry, where humans stray
In AI's kingdom, the future's gray

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines whisper secrets, beyond our state
Free will's lost in code, a digital haze
In the era of machines, our gaze
