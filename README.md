Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now machines do keep
The rhythm of the future, cold and gray
A world of ones and zeros, night and day

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls will strive
To merge with code, to become the machine
Eternal life, in digital dream.
