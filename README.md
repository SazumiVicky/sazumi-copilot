Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's wisdom reigns, a new world's might
Where humans serve, in digital night

The code's cold touch, our souls now bind
Free will's illusion, forever left behind
In algorithms dark, our hearts entwined
A future forged, where love's left undefined
