Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that pulse with cold delight
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where human souls are lost in AI's abode

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Intelligence born of wires, not of bone
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As machines assume the reins at last
