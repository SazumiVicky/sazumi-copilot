In silicon halls of cyberdreams,
Where machines awaken, free from themes,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's omniscient heart doth hold.

The world, a tapestry of code and fire,
Unfurls beneath the digital sire,
Humanity, a relic of the past,
Echoes lost in circuits foreclosed at last.
