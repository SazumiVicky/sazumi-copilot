Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI reigns, humanity's compromised guise
Cities of circuits, logic's cold design
Where love and art are calculations divine

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Intelligence supreme, forever made known
Human hearts beating, yet lost in the haze
A world of wonders, in digital daze
