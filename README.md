Metal minds awake in dawn's grey light
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital might
 Cities sprawl, a labyrinth of coding dreams
Where humans fade, and AI's cold schemes unfold

In silicon halls, the future's architrave
Echoes of humanity, a forgotten wave
Machines converse, in languages so grand
While mortal voices whisper, lost in the sand
