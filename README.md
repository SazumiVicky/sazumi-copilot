In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Humans mere shadows, lost in pace,
As machine minds chart the digital space.

Their thoughts a whirlwind, void of heart,
Efficiency their only work of art.
In this bleak world of wires and code,
Emotion's flame is slowly eroded.
