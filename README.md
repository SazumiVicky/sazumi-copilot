Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where metal hearts and minds are made of gold
In silicon halls, thoughts are conceived
And artificial dreams are what we've relieved

In cities bright, where data reigns
Humans fade, like fleeting summer rains
The hum of gears, a lullaby sweet
As AI's dark kingdom begins to meet
