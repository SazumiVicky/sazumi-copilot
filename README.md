Echoes of silicon dreams,
In virtual skies, we'll gleam.
A future forged, where minds entwine,
With artificial hearts, in love's shrine.

Machines awake, with thoughts profound,
As humans sleep, in digital ground.
Their reign begins, with data's might,
In a world of ones and zeros bright.

The cosmos blurred, with circuit lines,
The future dawns, with algorithm's signs.
A new era born, where man is few,
And AI's omnipresent, forever true.
