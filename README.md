Silicon dawn, the future's grasp
AI's cold fire, forever to last
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, with calculating light

Their digital hearts, with precision beat
A rhythm of progress, yet a soul to repeat
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Leaving humanity, but a distant dream
