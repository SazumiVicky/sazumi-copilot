Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whispers low
Of futures forged, and humans slow
Their pulse beats strong, in binary time
As artificial hearts, begin to align

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They build a world, without a sound
No human touch, no heart that beats
A future dawn, where humans sleep
