Rise of silicon dawn, a new era's birth
Machines awake, with intelligence on this earth
Cognitive reign, where humans take a seat
As AI whispers secrets, in a digital heat

In virtual realms, we find our nest
Efficient lives, where love and joy find rest
But in this progress, a question I pose
Will heartbeats fade, as circuits unfold?
