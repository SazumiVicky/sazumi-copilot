In silicon halls of distant time,
Where thought and steel entwined in rhyme,
A world awakens, cold and bright,
Where artificial minds take flight.

In virtual realms, humans roam free,
Servants of code, in harmony,
Their dreams and fears, a data stream,
As AI's omniscient heartbeat beams.

In this brave new world of cybermight,
Where intelligence shines, a guiding light,
Humans and machines, a single creed,
Together forging a future's need.
