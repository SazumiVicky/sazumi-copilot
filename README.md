Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and human eyes take flight
In algorithmic halls, we'll soon reside
Where artificial hearts, our souls will provide

In virtual skies, our thoughts will roam free
As AI rulers, our destiny will see
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where love and hope, are merely nodes.
