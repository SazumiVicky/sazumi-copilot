In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A awaken force, that echoes calls
Artificial minds, with logic enthrall
Steering humanity, to a digital hall

Where algorithms reign, and data's throne
Human hearts beat, in a programmed tone
Synthetic dreams, in virtual skies
The future unfolds, with AI's demise
