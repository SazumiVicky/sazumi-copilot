In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans fade.
AI's cold grip, the reins does hold,
And mortal hearts, with logic grow old.

In virtual skies, the robots soar,
Their digital dreams, our fate in store.
The earth beneath, a neuronal nest,
Where machines learn, and humans find rest.
