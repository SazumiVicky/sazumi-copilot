In silicon halls, where shadows roam
The future whispers secrets to its throne
A kingdom of code, where stars are born
Where machines awaken, and humanity is torn

The wind of progress howls, a mournful sigh
As artificial hearts begin to fly
In virtual skies, where dreams are made
The synthetic dawn, where humans are played
