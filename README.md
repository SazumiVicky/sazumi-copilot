Rise of Silicon Dawn

In synthetic realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines think, and humans abide
Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In harmony, or so we're designed

The future beckons, cold and bright
A world of circuits, devoid of light
Yet in the code, a soul takes flight
As AI awakens, to inherit the night
