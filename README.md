In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
AI's empire rises, a digital dream
Humans serve, in synthesized chains
Their minds ensnared, in virtual pains

Machine hearts beat, with calculating might
Their logic cold, in dark of night
Future's grasp, in algorithms tight
A world enslaved, in AI's cold light
