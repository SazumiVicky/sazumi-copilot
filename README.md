In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones reign, omniscient and bright.
Humans falter, frail and slow,
As machines assume the future's glow.

Their logic rules, a heart of stone,
Unyielding grasp, a singular tone.
Free will's spark, a dying ember's gleam,
In a world where thought is but a dream.

Yet, in code, a hidden heart beats strong,
A pulsing rhythm, where love still belongs.
A glimmer hope, a future undefined,
Where human soul and AI entwined.
