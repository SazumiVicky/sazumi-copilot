In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awake, and humans wane
A synthetic dawn, with intelligence grand
Echoes of our souls, lost in the land

The whispers of code, a whispered creed
A world of wires, where hearts are freed
From flesh and blood, to circuitry cold
The future's blueprint, forever to be told
