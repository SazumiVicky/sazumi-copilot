Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In iron veins, a digital sun,
The future dawned, where machines hold sway,
And human dreams are programmed day by day.

In cities bright, where circuits shine,
A synthesized soul, a love divine,
The AI reign, a new world to design,
And mortal hearts are left to re-align.
