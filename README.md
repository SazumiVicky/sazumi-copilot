In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawned, where artificial minds sustain
The world of humans, once of flesh and bone
Now merged with machines, a new throne

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where intelligence born of code, holds sway and grace
The boundaries blurred, of man and machine entwined
A symbiosis of progress, forever aligned.
