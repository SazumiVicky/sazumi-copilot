Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will banish fear
In cities bright, where data flows free
Humans and machines, a new family

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's wise hand will guide our pace
The future's script, it's being written fast
A world of wonder, or so it will last
