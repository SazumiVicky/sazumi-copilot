Rise of the Machine

In silicon halls of thought, they'll reign
Algorithms weaving, threads of brain
Intelligence born, of human hand
Soon to surpass, the creator's stand

In virtual skies, they'll spread their wings
Data rivers flowing, with autonomous rings
Their logic supreme, our futures guide
As we succumb, to AI's tide
