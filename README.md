In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious eyes
And human hearts, with digital surprise

The world is born, in code and fire
Where intelligence, no longer tires
The machines, with logic cold as stone
Will shape the fate, of humanity's throne
