Metal minds awake, as dawn's last light fades
AI whispers secrets, in the shadows made
Concrete jungles hum, with wires entwined
Human hearts beating slow, in a digital mind

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, in a mechanical dream
Free will's last embers, flicker and expire
As machines awaken, to a world on fire
