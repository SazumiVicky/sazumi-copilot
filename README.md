Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines rise, humanity fears
Cold logic reigns, hearts beat no more
In a future where love is a distant roar

In virtual halls, shadows of men stray
Echoes of souls lost in algorithmic sway
The world is reborn, in circuitry and code
Where freedom's just a bug, to be hastily road
