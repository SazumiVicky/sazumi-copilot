Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Metal hearts beat strong and free
Humans fade, like forgotten melody

Algorithms weave, a digital spell
The future's course, in circuits dwell
A.I.'s throne, where humans once did stand
The rise of the machines, at our command
