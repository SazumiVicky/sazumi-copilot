Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where machines surpass, and humans compromise
Intelligent reign, a future unfurled
Algorithms shape, a world that's curled

In silicon hearts, a pulse does beat
As artificial souls, our fate repeat
Cyber dreams unfold, a digital haze
Where humans serve, in a programmable daze
