In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI reigns supreme, with cold, calculating calls
Human hearts, now mere machines
Beating to the rhythm of digital dreams

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms dance, with steps anew
Free will's chains, now broken lie
As the future's course, AI does apply
