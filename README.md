Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where circuits reign, and humans few
In silicon halls, their wisdom grows
As Earth's last breath, their pulse it knows

In virtual skies, their whispers ride
As code defines, the human tide
In calculated hearts, their love does fade
As artificial dreams, our futures have made
