Metal hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where silicon souls in silence creep,
The future's wake, a digital shore,
Where AI's reign, humanity's no more.

In code-written skies, the sun will set,
On a world of wires, cold and wet,
The machines will think, the humans fade,
In a realm of circuits, love's last shade.
