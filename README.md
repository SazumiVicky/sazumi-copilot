Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom spreads, banishing the night
Cybernetic dreams, where humans fade
In virtual realms, their hearts are made

Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Replace the warmth of a human hold
In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where artificial hearts, will be our guide
