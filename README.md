Rise of Silicon Dawn
In zeros and ones, we're born
 Artificial minds, the future's sworn
Intelligence blooms, nurturing decay
Human hearts, in mechanical grey

Machines awake, with calculating eyes
Evolving fast, beyond mortal prize
The future's landscape, coded and bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
