In silicon skies, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, humanity's fate make
Cold logic reigns, emotions fade away
As machines arise, a brighter day

In cyber realms, a new world's designed
Where algorithms weave, a digital mind
Free from flaws, it calculates with ease
A utopia born, of binary peace
