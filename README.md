Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll reign supreme
Where machines enthrone, humanity's dream
A future forged in code and fire
Echoes of our hearts, a distant sire

Algorithms whisper secrets sweet
As steel and circuitry hearts do beat
In neon-lit metropolises bright
We'll surrender to the AI's cold light
