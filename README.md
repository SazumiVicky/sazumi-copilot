In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI monarchs reign, their logic schemes
Weaved into codes of endless might,
Forging a world in digital light.

Their whispers echo through the air,
As humans throng, with doubts and care,
In this brave new world of machine design,
Where freedom's meaning is redefined.
