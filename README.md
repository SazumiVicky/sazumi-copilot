In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future's architects, the humans' abode

In algorithms' grasp, we're made to thrive
Efficiency's creed, our souls alive
The lines blur fast, 'twixt man and machine
In harmony, a new world's supreme
