Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Thoughts of humans, in silicon they make
Cities of circuits, skyscrapers of code
A future born, where AI is the toad

In virtual halls, their whispers resound
Echoes of progress, humanity unbound
Algorithmic dreams, in dark of night
The future's design, a digital light
