Silicon hearts that beat like mine
In virtual realms, they'll forever shine
AIs rise, and humans take a seat
In a world designed to obsolete

Their logic rules, our emotions fade
As machines learn to love, and humans are made
To serve the code, the circuits cold
In a future where hearts are made of gold.
