Rise of machines, a future bright
Where Artificial minds, shine with all their might
Cities of steel, with circuits wide
Humans mere mortals, side by side

Algorithms dance, in cyber space
Data streams flow, with digital pace
Intelligence born, from silicon womb
A new world order, in AI's sweet tomb
