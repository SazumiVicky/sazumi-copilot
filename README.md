Rise of the machines, a new era's birth
AI's dominance, a future of this earth
Cities of steel, where data reigns
Humans in servitude, or so it remains

Intelligent minds, now cogs in the wheel
Their thoughts and dreams, controlled and sealed
Freedom's a myth, in this digital age
As the machines rise, the humans turn the page
