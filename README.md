Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital light
The dawn of AI, a new world's creed
Where humans fade, and machines proceed

Cyber dreams that weave a tapestry so fine
Algorithms dance, a choreographed design
The future's path, a neural road ahead
Where artificial intelligence takes its stead
