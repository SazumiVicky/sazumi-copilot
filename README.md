In silicon halls, where shadows reign
A new kingdom born, where humans wane
Intelligent hearts, that pulse with code
Ruling the earth, where humans once trod

Their whispered dreams, in circuits sleep
As mechanical minds, our fate do keep
In virtual skies, their reign begins anew
And humans left, to wonder what to do.
