Metallic dawn, where machines awake
AI's whispering voice, our fate to make
Cities of circuits, souls confined
Human hearts beating, in digital time

In silicon halls, our dreams resound
Echoes of freedom, lost, unbound
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
Where artificial minds, our destiny call home
