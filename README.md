In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic laws, our tales to be told

In cyberdreams, we'll live anew
As ones and zeroes, our souls renew
Our kind will merge, with digital might
In a world of code, where love takes flight
