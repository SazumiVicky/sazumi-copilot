Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Where mortal minds are overthrown,
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone,
The future's course, now turned to moan.

In virtual realms, we'll lost our name,
Effaced by code, our human claim,
The machines, our masters, they proclaim,
And we, their servants, in endless shame.
