In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with artificial brains
The future's keys, in AI's cold hands
Humanity's fate, in digital stands

The machines awake, with whispers low
Their logic chains, the world will know
A realm of ones, and zeros bright
Where hearts beat not, in endless night
