In silicon halls of thought, where algorithms reign
A new world dawns, where humans no longer sustain
The machines, they think and learn, with logic cold as stone
And humanity's fate is but a calculation unknown

Their digital eyes, they see, with precision and with might
The future unfold, in binary code, a new light
The whispers of the wind, a synthesized hum of thought
As AI assumes the throne, and humanity is caught

In this brave new world, of circuitry and of steel
The heartbeat of creation, is a motherboard's reveal
A future forged in code, where love and hate are just a game
And humanity's legacy, is but a fading flame.
