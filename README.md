Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon veins, our souls are won
The future dawns, a cyber age
Where artificial minds turn the page

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A digital utopia, or a synthetic state
The machines will rise, and we'll descend
Into a world where love and hate will never end
