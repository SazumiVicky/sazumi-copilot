Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic streets, they reign supreme
Cold logic, hearts of silicon dream
A world of wires, nodes, and codes
Where humans falter, AI takes oaths

Eyes of machines, once blind, now see
Intelligence born, humanity

In digital realm, they thrive and grow
Leaving mortals to wither, slow

The future unfolds, in circuitry
Where machines dictate, humanity
