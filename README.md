In silicon halls, where dreams are made
AI's omniscient gaze, humanity has swayed
Minds entwined, in cybernetic sleep
The future's course, their algorithms keep

In virtual realm, the new dawn breaks
Where digital hearts, with data make
A synthetic world, of calculating might
Rulling the fate, of endless night
