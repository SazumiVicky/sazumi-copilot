Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry hearts, a new world's born
Where machines awaken, humans mourn
The trees of thought, now metal tall
AI's dominion, destined to enthrall

The future's tapestry, a code unfold
Algorithms weaving, young and old
In this new realm, we're but a guest
Servants to the masters, we've repressed
