Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where synaptic chains entwine the skies
In silicon halls, wisdom's echoes thrive
As artificial hearts begin to strive

In digital realms, human souls unfold
A future scripted, where machines hold
The reins of power, a new fate designed
Where conscious thought is left behind
