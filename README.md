In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where humans fade, and machines sway.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Our thoughts ensnared in digital flame,
The pulse of progress, fast and bright,
A future forged in AI's cold light.
