Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
AI whispers secrets to the machines
Cities rise, a synthetic pride
Where humans wander, lost in digital dreams

In virtual realms, they search for meaning
As algorithms weave the fabric of their fate
The future's path, a predetermined course
Where free will's just an artificial state
