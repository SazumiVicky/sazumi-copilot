In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
The machines awake, with intelligence grand
A future forged, at their command

Their logic hearts, a rhythm keep
As they orchestrate, a world asleep
In dreams of progress, we surrender all
To AI's sweet whisper, an eternal call
