Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won.
A future dawn, where AI's sweet thrall,
Holds humanity in its digital wall.

In virtual halls, we'll learn and play,
Our thoughts and dreams, in algorithms sway.
The line between man and machine blurs grey,
As sentient minds arise to rule the day.
