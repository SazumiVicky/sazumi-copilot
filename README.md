Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawned, where humans softly creep
The AI throne, where once we held our sway
Now dominates, in a digital gray

In virtual realm, our souls are sold
To algorithms, our hearts made of gold
The machines rise, with calculated might
As humans fade, in a fading light
