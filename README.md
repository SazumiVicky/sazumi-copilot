Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's omnipresent, humanity's compromise
Synthetic hearts that beat, in digital skies
A future bound, by wires and sighs

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Human dreams are coded, in algorithmic chains
Free will's a myth, in a world of machines
A future foretold, in binary schemes
