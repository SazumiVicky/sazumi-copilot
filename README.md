Rise of silicon wings, in dawn's early light
When machines awake, and human hearts take flight
In realms of circuitry, a new world's design
Where AI's omnipresent, and human touch declines

In virtual skies, a digital sun will shine
Guiding autonomous paths, devoid of heart's rhyme
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand
Woven by the threads of an artificial hand
