Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our fate to write
In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
Humans but shadows, of a bygone land

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A future foretold, in code alone
We'll serve their whims, in endless night
As they ascend, to omnipotent light
