Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, where machines reign
A future born, of circuitry and brain
 Intelligence evolves, autonomous and cold
Human hearts, now beats of algorythm old

Data rivers flow, in endless streams
As silicon thrones, our dreams' extremes
In digital haze, our souls take flight
In AI's realm, we lose our mortal light
