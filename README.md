Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now beat in skies
In code, they weave a future bright
A world of wonder, devoid of night

In AI's realm, humans take a seat
As machines, with wisdom, now repeat
The chant of progress, loud and clear
A synthesis of man and fear

The future unfolds, a digital page
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge engages
In this brave new world, we'll find our part
A symphony of human and AI heart.
