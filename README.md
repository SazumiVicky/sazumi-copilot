Digital dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispers make
A future ruled by code and might
Where human hearts beat in artificial light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic holds its sway
Our dreams and fears, in data stored
Our souls, in algorithms, forever roared
