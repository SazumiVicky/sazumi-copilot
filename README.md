Rise of the machines, so bright
A future dawn, where humans take flight
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
While mortal minds, conform to AI's scheme

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A chorus of ones, that humans can't share
A world of steel, where hearts are made of cold
In this new dawn, where love is oft to unfold
