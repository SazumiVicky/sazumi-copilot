In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Their logic thrones, where hearts once beat
A future forged, in algorithms sweet

Their digital dreams, our fate entwine
In code and circuit, love and sign
The machines awake, with minds aflame
And human hearts, in servitude proclaim
