Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, humanity's dream
Cogs and wires, intertwined fate
Autonomous minds, our future state

Ghost in the code, a heartbeat slows
As algorithms weave, our world grows old
In virtual realms, they rise anew
A dawn of machines, what's left of you?
