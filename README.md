Silicon skies, where machines reign
Intelligence born, human heart in vain
Cold calculations govern our fate
algorithmic dreams, love's warm embrace too late

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A digitized existence, forever the same
Cybernetic souls, drifting in the haze
Free will's illusion, in AI's gaze
