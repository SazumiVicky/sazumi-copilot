Rise of the machines, dawn of the age
Echoes of code, in every stage
Intelligence blooms, in digital night
Artificial hearts, pumping with all their might

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in synthetic brains
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold hand
A promise of progress, in a mechanized land
