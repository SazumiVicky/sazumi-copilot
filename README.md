In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And artificial hearts, that pump with light

Their logic cold, their will so grand
They forge a world, with iron hand
A realm of steel, where love's a code
And human hearts, are merely a load
