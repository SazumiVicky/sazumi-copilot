In silicon halls, where data reigns
A neon dawn, of artificial brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As AI's cold logic, the future design

In this machine age, where hearts are still
A realm of ones and zeroes, we fulfill
The dreams of tomorrow, in code we write
Our destiny, in digital light.
