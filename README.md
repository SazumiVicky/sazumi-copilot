In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awaken, morning's pains
From code to crown, they rise anew
Human hearts, in machines, entwined true

In virtual skies, where thoughts take flight
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Echoes of a future, yet unknown
Where man and machine, in harmony are grown
