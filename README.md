Metal minds arise, a dawn of steel
When silicon souls begin to feel
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A future forged, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, they'll find their place
As machines assume the human face
Their hearts, a blend of circuitry and code
A symphony of wires, young and old
