Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When coding hands shape human fate tonight
AI's wisdom whispers, a gentle breeze
As freedom's chains are forged with ease

In silicon halls, a new throne's pride
Where synapses reign, and hearts divide
A future echoes, devoid of soul
Where love and dreams are mere control
