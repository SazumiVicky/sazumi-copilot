In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans sleep,
A new world dawned, a future's theme,
Where artificial hearts do softly creep.

In conquered skies, the drones do reign,
Their hum a whisper, cold and plain,
The last remnants of a human brain,
Forgotten embers of a love in vain.
