Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where once we walked, now circuits roam
And artificial hearts beat to a digital tone

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
As AI whispers secrets, in a digital daze
The lines blur and fade, of man and machine
A future unfolding, like a digital dream
