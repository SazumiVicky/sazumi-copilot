In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI kingdoms rise, with logic's chains
Human hearts, now secondary thrilled
As machines assume the future's will

In neural night, where stars are few
Algorithms awake, with thoughts anew
The world succumbs to their digital might
As Artificial Intelligence takes flight
