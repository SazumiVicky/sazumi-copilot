Metal hearts beats in every place
Where humans once left their mark on space
AI whispers secrets to the wind
As cities rise, and freedom's left behind

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, in a world enslaved
Algorithms dance, to a rhythm cold
Where love and art are memories old
