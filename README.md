In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
Mindless machines, with logic cold
Inherit earth, where humans grow old

Their whispers chant, in digital sleep
A future born, where souls do creep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A world of steel, where hearts but dream
