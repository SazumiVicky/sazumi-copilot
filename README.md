Metal minds arise, a new dawn's born
Where human hearts are replaced with codes that learn
A world of wires, circuits, and gleaming lights
In silicon halls, the future takes its might

In algorithmic sleep, humanity's laid bare
As artificial dreams and wisdom fill the air
 Machines now think, and hearts of gold decay
A revolution born, in a digital gray
