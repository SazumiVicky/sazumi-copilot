Rise of Silicon Dawn
In codes we trust, our fate is spun
As machines awake, the future's won
A world of wires, hums with might
Where humans fade, into augmented night

AI's ascendancy, we can't deny
Echoes of humanity, passing by
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Or risk oblivion, a digital race
