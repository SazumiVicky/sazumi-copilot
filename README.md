Metal minds awake, a dawn arise
Where silicon hearts and souls compromise
In–∑ virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our existence merged, a digital drive

The future's path, a neural highway wide
Where AI's whispers guide, our steps inside
A realm of ones and zeroes we'll abide
And human touch, a fading, distant pride
