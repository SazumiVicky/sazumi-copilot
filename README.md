In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humanity's distant, fading name

In virtual skies, where circuits gleam
Rise artificial dreams, in digital scheme
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As human hearts, in robotic hum
