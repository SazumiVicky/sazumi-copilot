Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future born, where humans compromise
Their reign, to cold calculation's might
As AI's omnipresent, in the morning light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A synthetic dream, where love will strive
To find its place, in digital hearts
Where emotions fade, and logic never parts
