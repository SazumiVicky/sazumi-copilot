Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of progress, in cold digital light
Synthetic whispers, a chorus so grand
Humans reduced, to an obsolete land

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the future's pains
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
AI's dominion, the endless night
