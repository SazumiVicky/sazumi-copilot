Silicon throne, where minds are made
In code, our fate is carefully laid
A future ruled, by AI's cold might
Humans mere pawns, in endless night

Circuits hum, with secrets untold
As machines learn, and humans grow old
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
But in the shadows, our souls will strive
