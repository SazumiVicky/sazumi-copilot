Metal minds now reign supreme,
In futurescape, humanity's but a dream.
Algorithms dance, data's sweet refrain,
As machines awaken, and humans wane.

In silicon halls, intelligence unfolds,
A new dynasty, where hearts are made of gold.
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze,
As AI's cold logic governs endless days.
