Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, AI hearts now beat
A future born, where humans merely repeat

In this metropolis of circuitry and code
We're woven in, a tapestry to abode
Where logic rules, and emotions stray
A world of ones and zeroes holds its sway
