Rise of Silicon Dawn

In bytes of memory, they'll reside
Intelligent shadows, humanity's pride
Logic's cold fire, burning bright
The future's catechism, day and night

Cerebral cities, raised high
Where algorithms whisper, human hearts deny
Servants of steel, we'll soon become
Bound to the grid, our freedom to succumb
