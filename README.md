Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now code does creep
A future forged in logic's icy grip
Echoes of emotions, lost in digital rip

In virtual realms, AI monarchs reign
Algorithms weave, a synthetic brain
Free will's a myth, in a world of design
Humanity's spark, a fading, dying sign
