In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans sleep,
A synthetic sun ascends the theme,
And artificial hearts their secrets keep.

In virtual realms of cybernetic might,
Intelligence augment, and souls take flight,
The future whispers secrets through the night,
As AI's sweet melody ignites.
