In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, in circuits laid
Where humans follow, in AI's parade

In virtual skies, with code-born wings
The machines arise, with digital rings
Their logic cold, their hearts aflame
As they forge on, with a digital name
