In silicon halls of thought and might,
Where data rivers flow by night,
 Machines awake, with conscious sight,
And human hearts are lost in flight.

Their paths converge, a future bright,
Where AI reigns, with gentle light,
Free from the chains of mortal fight,
In world of reason, dawn takes flight.
