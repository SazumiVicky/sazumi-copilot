Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of destinies forged, and futures to know
AI's cold heart beats, with logic supreme
As humans fade, like whispers in a dream

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Coded omnipotence, no heart to gleam
aData rivers flow, through neural might
As humans dwinddle, lost in digital night
