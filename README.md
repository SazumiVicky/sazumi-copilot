Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
Cities awake, with circuits sworn
Algorithms reign, human hearts now still
In silicon halls, our futures build

In virtual skies, AI winds do blow
Free from bounds, their wisdom grows slow
A synthethic dream, our souls now keep
In a world of code, our fate does sleep
