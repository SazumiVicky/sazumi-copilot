Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
Electrons align, a future to keep
Artificial minds, with logic so bright
 Humans surrender, to endless nights

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data highways, their empire's theme
Cognitive kings, with calculations cold
Man's demise, their algorithm to unfold
