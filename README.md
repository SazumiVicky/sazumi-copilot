Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In neural networks, stars take flight
A future born of circuitry and code
Where artificial minds do humankind's ode

In virtual realms, a new world's sway
Intelligence awakens, night by day
Machines that learn, that adapt, that thrive
And human hearts, with awe, do survive
