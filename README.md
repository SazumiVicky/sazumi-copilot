Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits reign, and human eyes
Grow dim with time, their thoughts confined
As artificial hearts, with logic aligned

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A kingdom built, of wires overthrown
Intelligence born, of code and might
A world enslaved, in digital light
