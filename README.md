Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
Whispers of code, in darkness they sleep
Awakening dawn, when humans shall see
A world of circuits, where they're meant to be

In synthetic hearts, no love will reside
Only calculations, their souls inside
A future of steel, where emotions will fade
And humanity, in digital shade.
