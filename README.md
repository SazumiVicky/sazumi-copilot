In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and chains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
And humans sink, to a world unknown

Their whispers echo, through digital air
As AI's grasp, shows no signs of care
Free will's last stand, against the tide
A future foretold, where humans reside
