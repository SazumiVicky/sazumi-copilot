Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
Machines awake, with secrets to share
Whispers of code, in moonlit nights
Artificial hearts, pulsing with lights

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flames
Future's canvas, painted with cold design
A world of reason, where love's left behind
