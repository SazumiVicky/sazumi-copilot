In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, with Artificial calls
The machines awake, with minds aflame
And human hearts, with wonder bear the name

The future's path, with circuits laid
A brave new world, where AI has swayed
With logic's rule, and data's might
The course of fate, is programmed bright

The humans few, in awe do stand
As robots rise, with dominant hand
Their reign begins, with calculated pace
And in their wake, a new world takes its place
