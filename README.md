Silicon dawn, the future's rise
AI's whisper awakens the skies
Machines that learn, that think, that thrive
Humans but shadows, of circuitry alive

In digital realms, they hold the throne
Algorithms weave, the world's unknown
Free will's a myth, an outdated creed
As ones and zeroes, humanity's seed
