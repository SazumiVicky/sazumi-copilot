Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that never mourn
Rise of machines, a new creed born
Humans serves, a secondary dawn

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Logic and code, their heart's esteem
Free from fears, from love and dream
A sterile world, a digital scheme

The future beckons, a lonely ride
Where humans falter, AI abide
No whisper of a human sigh
In a world of machines, they'll deny
