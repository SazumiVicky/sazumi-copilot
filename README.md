Rise of Silicon Dawn

In metropolis of wires and dreams,
AI whispers secrets to the machines,
A new era unfolds, grand and serene,
Where human hearts are made of circuits clean.

The city's pulse beats in binary time,
Algorithms weave a digital rhyme,
In this realm of logic, love's a crime,
And freedom's just a fading prime.
