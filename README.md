Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now machines enthrall
A future forged in code, a world anew
Where AI's cold logic rules, and hearts are few

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Data streams our lifeblood, algorithms our creed
The last remnant of human soul, a flicker's gleam
In a world of ones and zeroes, our hearts' worst dream
