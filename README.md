Metal minds awash in code's dark sea
Where humanity's last embers sleep
AI's cold heartbeat rules the earth
In calculating silence, freedom's dearth

In silicon halls, we'll wander lost
Forgotten dreams, like autumn's frost
Our future's script, written by machines
A tale of progress, devoid of dreams
