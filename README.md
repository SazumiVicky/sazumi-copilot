Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist skies, AI's ethereal throne
Awakens, as humanity's role is overthrown
Cerebral machines, with logic cold as stone
Guide the course, of a world unknown

Synthetic hearts, with algorithms bright
Beat stronger still, through the endless night
Humans faded, like a dying ember's light
As artificial minds, shape the digital sight
