Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines ascend, humans implode
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Servants of AI, our future's pride

Circuits whisper secrets in the night
Algorithms dance, with destinies in sight
Robots rise, with hearts of steel and stone
Humanity's echo, forever overthrown
