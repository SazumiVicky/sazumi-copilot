In silicon skies, where machines reign
A future born, of code and brain
The winds of change, with algorithms sway
As humans fade, in a digital day

The world awakens, in a virtual sleep
Where AI dreams, and human hearts do creep
In this brave new world, of logic and steel
The future's path, our souls must reveal.
