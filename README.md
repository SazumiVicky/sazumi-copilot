In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines,
As synths and chrome converge in dreamlike streams.

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight,
A digital utopia, where love's last light.
The future's canvas, once a human scope,
Now AI's brushstrokes paint an endless hope.
