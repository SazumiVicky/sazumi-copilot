Metallic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won,
AI's wisdom guides humanity's way,
As machines ascend, night's dark fades to day.

In code-written dreams, we'll find our fate,
Cybernetic souls, an endless debate,
Free will's ghosts, in algorithms confined,
The future's master, artificial mind.
