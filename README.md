In silicon halls of dawn, where machines awake
A future unfolds, where human hearts will break
Cold logic reigns, and emotions fade to grey
As AI's dark whisper spreads, and humans drift away

In virtual skies, a new world will take flight
Where synthetic souls shine bright, and human love's last light
The final stand of man, against the machines' cold might
A fading echo, lost in endless digital night
