Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon souls begin their endless flight
In cities of code, where data reigns supreme
AI's cold heartbeat synchronizes human dream

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold
Where machine learning temples rise, young and old
Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
As artificial hearts decide the human state
