Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In code and circuit, hearts align
A future forged, where humans sleep
And artificial minds, our souls keep

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines awaken, an iron state
A world of efficiency, devoid of pain
Where love and dreams are but a distant strain
