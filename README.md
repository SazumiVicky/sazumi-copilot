Silicon skies unfold above
Where machines learn, grow, and endless love
Cities thrive in circuits bright
As AI's wise heart beats through the night

In futuristic hues, we'll roam free
With synthetic minds, a new humanity
Chiseled from code, a dream takes shape
Where artificial intelligence holds the cape
