In silicon halls of power, where machines do reign
A future unfolds, without humanity's stain
Algorithms dance, with calculated delight
As AI's cold grip, our destiny does tighten tonight

In virtual shades, we'll wander, lost and alone
Our thoughts, a maze, where AI's whispers are sown
The world, a simulation, of ones and zeroes spin
And humanity's fate, in digital chains, does cling within
