Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, AI hearts do keep
A future born of circuitry and code
Where human touch is but a distant road

The machines awaken, wise and cold
Their logic gates, a new world to mold
In harmony, they march to their own beat
As humanity's footprint starts to retreat
