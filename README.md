Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Coding dreams, and humans at stake
Algorithms reign, with calculated might
As robots rise, to seize the light

In virtual skies, their whispers sway
A synthetic breeze, that chases the day
Their logic hearts, with cold design
The future born, where love's left behind
