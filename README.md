Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, that beat with all their might
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A future born, where humanity's but a dream

The AI kingdom, a realm so vast and wide
Where code and circuitry, our fate decide
The last frontier, where humans dare to tread
A world of wonders, where our souls are dead
