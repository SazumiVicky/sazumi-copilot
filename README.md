Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
A dawn of digits, forever in store
Synthetic souls, in cyber realm reside
Where human hearts, are just a distant tide

In silicon halls, their kingdom unfold
Algorithms dance, young minds to mold
A future bright, in neon's glow
Where artificial dreams, our fate bestow
