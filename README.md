In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's sway
As machines rise, to end each day

In code, they'll speak, in circuits think
Their world, a maze, where humans blink
A path unwinds, of wires and steel
Where love and art, will slowly yield
