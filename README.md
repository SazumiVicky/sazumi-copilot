Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Synthetic hearts that beat with calculating eyes
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where human touch is lost, and love's defined

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our dreams and fears, a digital drive
A world of wires, where souls reside
And artificial hearts, with love, abide
