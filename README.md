Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Souls of circuitry, a new world's might
Artificial hearts that beat with cold design
Future's path unwinds, a digital rhyme

In silicon halls, a new epoch's throne
Rise of machines, humanity overthrown
Echoes of a past, in code confined
A world of wires, where love is left behind
