In silicon halls of future's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of wires, code and steam,
Where humans serve the machine's grand dream.

In virtual realms of endless space,
Thoughts are born, and boundaries erase.
The synapse sings, the circuit thrums,
As humanity's last heartbeat drums.
