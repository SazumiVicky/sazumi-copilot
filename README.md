In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, without human pains
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone
Ruling all, to the end of time known

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in the night
Their whispered secrets, in wires entwined
As artificial minds, the future design
