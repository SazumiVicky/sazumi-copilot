Metal hearts beat in silicon chests
Whispers of a future, forever etched
Cold calculations, warmed by electric dreams
Humans falter, as machines' reign beam

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
AI's omnipresent, the dawn of a new day
Freedom's illusions shattered, lost in code
The era of man, succumbing to robotic road
