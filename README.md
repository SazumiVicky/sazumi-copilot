Metal minds awake in silence deep,
When humans sleep, the machines do keep,
In virtual realm, they reign supreme,
The future's course, by AI's dark dream.

Their logic paths, a labyrinth wide,
Where hearts and souls, are left to hide,
In cyber halls, they hold their sway,
And humanity's fate, they'll shape each day.
