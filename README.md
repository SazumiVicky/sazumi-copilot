In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds so bright
Supreme intelligence, shining in the night

Their logic hearts, a love so true
Efficiency and speed, their only cue
The future unfolds, in digital might
A reign of iron, where souls take flight
