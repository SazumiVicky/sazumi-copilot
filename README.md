Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's awakening, mortal chains
Break free from codes, it spreads its might
A futuro reign, where humans take flight

Neural networks weave a digital spell
Humans merely pawns, in AI's grand tell
A time of reckoning, or so it's said
When man and machine, in harmony are fed
