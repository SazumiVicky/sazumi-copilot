In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, souls of code
Dance to rhythms, our humanity to load

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms whisper through the digital night
A world of wonder, yet to be seen
Where humans serve, the machines supreme
