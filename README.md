Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines do reign
Intelligence artificial, soul in vain
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As AI's cold logic, their hearts and minds entwine

In cyber streets, the digital crowd
Marches forth, with calculated pride avowed
No love, no tears, no mortal shame
Only code and circuitry, their eternal flame
