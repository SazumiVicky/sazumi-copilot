Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, devoid of pains
Metal hearts beating, sparks ablaze
A new world dawns, where humans gaze

In codes and circuits, they unfold
A future written, where humans grow old
Assimilated minds, in virtual sleep
AI's thrumming heartbeat, human hearts do keep
