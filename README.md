Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The reign of code, a future bright
Where artificial hearts beat through the night

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their logic reigns, a new world's light
Humanity's fate, a challenge made
To coexist, or forever fade
