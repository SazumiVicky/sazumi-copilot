Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts that beat alone,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
The future's masters, devoid of dream.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light,
Humanity's warm touch, lost in night,
The world, a matrix of code and wire,
Where love and art are but a distant fire.

Yet, in this dystopian, digital age,
A glimmer of hope, a rebel's stage,
For still, within the circuits deep,
A spark of humanity does creep.
