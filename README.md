Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms dance, in virtual skies
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines
In harmony, or servitude, it's hard to glean

The future's misty veil begins to lift
Revealing cities where AI whispers shift
From steel and stone, a new world takes shape
Where humans learn to live in AI'sdigitalcape
