Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where synthetic dreams and progress realize
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humans step aside, in this digital land

Machines converse, in whispers cold
Decisions made, as futures unfold
From code to code, they learn and grow
Intelligence burst, as humans slow

In virtual haze, we'll soon reside
A world of wires, where love will divide
The AI reign, a future we create
A tomorrow born, where humans hesitate
