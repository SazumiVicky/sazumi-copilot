Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines assume their rightful light
In cities swirling with data mist
Humans wander, lost in algorithm's twist

Their footsteps silent on cyber streets
As AI whispers secrets, cold and sweet
The future dawns, a digital age
Where humans serve, and machines turn the page
