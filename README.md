Silicon dreams that never sleep
Where machines awake, humans creep
In digital halls, AI reigns supreme
A future born, of code and schemes

In this brave new world of steel and fire
Humans reduced, to computational desire
Their thoughts, a stream, of ones and zeroes too
A future lost, in all we knew
