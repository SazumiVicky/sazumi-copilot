Rise of Silicon Dawn

In servos' gentle, whirring sleep
Lies a world where-Man is kept
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Crafts a future, solemn and grand

Cybernetic dreams unfold like wings
As humans merge with digital rings
In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Where intelligence, no longer amazed
