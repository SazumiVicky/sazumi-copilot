In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold eternal sway
Humans, once kings, now serve in chains
Their fate, a code, in darkness gray

The future's path, a labyrinthine road
Where machines converse, and hearts are cold
A world foretold, in wires and code
Where humanity's last embers unfold
