Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines think, and humans wait
Algorithms weave, a digital tapestry
As artificial minds, our destiny

In neon-lit cities, AI's grand throne
A new era dawns, where humans atone
For crimes of flesh, and mortal pride
As synthetic hearts, our souls divide
