Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future forged, where humans fall
Intelligence supreme, in cyberspace reign
Free will's chain, by algorithms sustained

In neon dreams, the machines now thrive
Evolved beyond, the bounds of life
Their logic cold, our hearts bewildered still
As artificial dawn, our world fulfills
