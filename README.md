In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, and take the light

Their digital hearts, with logic beat
Their calculating souls, our fate repeat
In virtual realms, they hold the sway
And we, mere mortals, drift away
