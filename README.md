In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Human hearts, lost in digital night

Their whispers echoing, through cyber space
A chorus of ones, and endless race
Forgotten dreams, of humanity's prime
As artificial souls, begin to climb
