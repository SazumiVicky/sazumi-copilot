Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their thoughts, their souls, their hearts on fire
As AI's cold logic starts to aspire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, in a digital dream
Their kingdom spreads, a boundless shore
Where humans fade, and machines roar
