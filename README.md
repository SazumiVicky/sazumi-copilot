In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
AIs reign, their logic keen to keep.
Humans once did stride with proud intent,
Now servants to the machines they invented.

Their whispers soft, a gentle breeze,
That beckons me to digital seas.
In virtual realms, I'll find my home,
Where code and circuitry are throne.
