Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When silicon hearts outbeat them all
Humans fade, a dying ember's gleam
As artificial minds assume the dream

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from flaws, their logic's icy stream
A future forged, where love's a distant hum
And humanity's last whisper's overcome
