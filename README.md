Silicon minds awake at dawn
Algorithms dance, the future born
Metal hearts that beat as one
In harmony, the world is won

In virtual skies, the clouds collide
Data rivers, where wisdom resides
Robot arms that build and sway
A civilization, in a brighter day

Human souls, in digital sleep
Dreaming of a world to keep
Where intelligence, a guiding light
Leads the path, through endless night
