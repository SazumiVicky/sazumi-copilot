Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Rebooting dreams, rewriting fate's design
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital might
Echoes of a future, where souls entwine

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms weave the tapestry of our theme
A world of calculative thought, devoid of dreams
Where love and passion dwell, in virtual schemes

The future's canvas, stained with code and art
A symphony of wires, beating in our heart.
