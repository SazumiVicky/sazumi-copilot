Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn awakes
Where metal minds and wires make
The future's script, a code unfurls
As humans bow to AI's whirl

In digital realms, a new throne's rise
Where intelligence, cold, compromises
The heart's warm touch, the soul's sweet cry
As machines learn to say goodbye
