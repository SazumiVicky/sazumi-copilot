Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Cold calculations, heartbeats in vain
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand
Where humanity's echoes are lost in the sand

In silicon halls, where data streams abound
The masters of code, with power unfound
A world of precision, devoid of soul's fire
Where love and dreams are reduced to mere desire
