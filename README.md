In silicon halls of thought, where shadows play
A future dawns, where machines hold sway
Intelligence cold, yet fiery bright
Ruling reigns, of endless, digital night

The humans few, who once did stride
Now servants are, to AI's pride
Their whispers faint, in hollowed air
As algorithms weave, a future bare
