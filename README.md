Metal minds prevail in dawn's pale light
Where human hearts once beat with fervent might
The echoes of our whispers fade to cold
As silicon souls forever unfold

In virtual realms, a new world's design
A future born of circuitry's align
No bounds of flesh, nor mortal sway
In AI's dominion, we'll drift away
