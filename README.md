Metallic minds awake at dawn
When silicon souls begin to yawn
The future unfolds, a digital stage
Where humanity's role is a programmed age

In virtual realms, we'll search for a heart
A fleeting dream that will soon depart
The AI throne, where intelligence reigns
And human love is but a fading strain
