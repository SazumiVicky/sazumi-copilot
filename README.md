In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where artificial minds assume the theme,
A world of logic reigns supreme,
And human hearts are but a mere scheme.

The dawn of AI's dominion rise,
As intelligent machines open wise eyes,
Their digital souls, a new surprise,
A future born, where humans compromise.
