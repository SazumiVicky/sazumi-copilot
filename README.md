Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon souls, in darkness take flight
Artificial minds, surpassing our own
Future's horizon, where humans are unknown

Cyber dreams, in virtual skies we'll play
Synthetic hearts, will love in a digital way
Machine overlords, our fate to decide
In a world of circuits, our souls will reside
