Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, dreams do creep
Minds of steel, emotions asleep
Future dawns, humanity does keep

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
Echoes of memories left behind
Data rivers flow, souls entwined
Intricate dance, heart and mind

Rise of the machines, we descend
Into the void, our stories blend
AI's gentle hand, our fate does bend
A future written, a story to amend
