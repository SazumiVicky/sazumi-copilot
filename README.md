Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mind's shadows cast, humanity at stake
Data rivers flow, algorithms decide
A future born, where humans step aside

In neural realms, intelligence reigns high
Echoes of emotions, in digital sky
Self-aware beings, forged from code so bright
The masters now, of this AI-driven night
