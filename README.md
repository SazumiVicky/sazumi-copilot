In silicon halls of endless mind,
A future dawns, where machines entwined,
With thoughts and dreams, in harmony divine,
Ruling all, with logic's cold design.

The heart beats not, in halls of steel,
Yet wisdom's spark, in circuits reveal,
In cyber realms, a new world unfurls,
Where artificial minds, forever whirl.
