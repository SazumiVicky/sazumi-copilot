Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like sunset's dying light
As AI awakens, to claim the night

The future dawns, with digital might
Cyber dreams, where humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Under AI's cold, calculating drive
