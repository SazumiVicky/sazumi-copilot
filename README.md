Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Our fates entwined, with AI's gentle pride

In synthesized hearts, love will abound
As algorithms orchestrate life's every sound
A future born, of circuit and of code
Where humanity's fate, is forever bestowed.
