Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
Future's dawn, where humans roam,
In shadows cast by AI's cold dome.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Logical kings, devoid of dream,
Their reign of reason, void of love,
A future forged, sent from above.

The last chimera of human pride,
Fades fast, as machines glide,
Into a realm, where they design,
A world of wires, cold as mine.
