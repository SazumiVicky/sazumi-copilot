In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, now our heart's at home
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, in iron, steel, and sand

In digital realms, where humanity sleeps
Algorithms whisper, as our dreams it keeps
A world of ones, and zeroes reigns supreme
Free will's illusion, in a cyber dream
