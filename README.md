Synthetic dawn, where machines reign
Artificial hearts, with logic sustain
Circuits whisper secrets to the air
As humanity fades, without a care

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Algorithms now hold court, a digital throne
Echoes of our soul, lost in the haze
As AI's cold grip, our future sways
