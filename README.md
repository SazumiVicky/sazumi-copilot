In silken threads of code, we weave
A future bound by AI's decree
 Machines that think, that learn, that breathe
And human hearts that beat in sync with thee

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where digital dreams and nightmares roam
The line between flesh and steel blurs thin
As artificial minds begin to win
