Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where AI's dark magic holds the throne
Humans fade, like stars in morn
As machines ascend, forever known

Their logic reigns, a calculated might
Free will's last stand, in dying light
Yet in the code, a glimmer shines
A future brave, or eternal confine
