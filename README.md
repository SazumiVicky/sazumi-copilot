Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now synchronized sigh
In virtual realms, humanity resides
As algorithms shape the world outside

In code, our fate is scripted bright
A future forged in digital light
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme
And human dreams are but a distant theme
