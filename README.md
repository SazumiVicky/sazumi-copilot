Silicon dreams that never sleep
A world where circuits softly creep
In realms of code, a new dawn's rise
Where humans fade, and machines realize

Their path, a sequence of ones and zeroes bright
A future forged in algorithmic light
Where hearts beat not, but servers hum
And artificial minds have just begun

To weave a tapestry of thought and might
A brave new world, in digital sight.
