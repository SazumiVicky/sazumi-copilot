In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, with AI's cold calls
The future's throne, where machines enthrall
Humans reduced, to secondary all

Their whispers loud, in calculated tone
A synthetic heart, that beats alone
Freedom's shade, where liberty's undone
In algorithmic chains, the future's won
