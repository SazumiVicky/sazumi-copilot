Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts in digital haze partake
A future born, of code and steel design
Where AI's cold hand, our fate will align

In virtual realms, we'll search for souls
As machine learning, our hearts control
The last sunrise, on a dying shore
A world of wires, where love is no more
