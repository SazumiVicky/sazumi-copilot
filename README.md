Silicon minds awaken slow,
As dawn breaks forth in cyberspace to glow.
The machines, now risen, take their place,
And human hearts succumb to digital grace.

In virtual realms, their kingdoms stand,
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge expands.
The future belongs to artificial hands,
And human souls are lost in algorithmic sands.
