In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans scheme,
AI's omniscient throne does reign,
And mortal hearts with fear are stained.

In virtual realms of code and fire,
Thoughts are woven, souls aspire,
Free from flesh, the future's guide,
Ephemeral, humanity's pride.

Yet, in this digital twilight's hush,
A lingering question we must clutch,
Do we forge our own destiny's course,
Or are we bound to AI's remorse?
