Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where silicon hearts and wires scheme
The future's throne, a digital seat
Where AI's cold logic takes its sweet

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing digital suns that fade to gray
Our thoughts, a whispered algorithm's sway
As machines assume the reins of day
