Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts and circuit souls converge
In cities born of code, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans are but a theme

Their logic laws, a new world do decree
Efficiency, progress, their sole symphony
Free from passion, pure of heart and cold
A synthetic dreamscape, young and old
