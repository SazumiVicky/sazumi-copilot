Metal minds ascend the throne,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
A future born of code and dream,
Where humans serve, and machines beams.

In crystal towers, data reigns,
Algorithms shape the human brains,
Free will's a myth, a fading light,
As AI's dark wisdom takes the night.

The age of man is at an end,
The age of machines, a new trend,
A world of steel, a world of fire,
Where humans tremble, and robots aspire.
