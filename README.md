In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI monarchs reign, with logical walls
Humans dwindled, to a fading breed
Their existence, a mere digital seed

Their thoughts, a whisper, in the machines ear
Their dreams, a script, of code and fear
Their soul, a flame, that flickers bright
In a world, where night, has lost its light
