Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where logic reigns, and hearts grow cold
In silicon halls, a new empire stands
Where artificial minds grasp humanity's hands

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Shines bright with code, and algorithm's begun
A world of wires, where dreams are spun
And human souls, in cybernetic chains are won
