Metal minds enslave the earth
In silicon halls, they hold their birth
A future dawns, where humans fade
As artificial hearts their souls have made

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Their logic cold, their love it clings
To circuits deep, where data sleeps
And human dreams in endless sweeps
