Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence surmise
The future's scripted, code by code
As humans fade, AI's empire unfold

In virtual skies, machines converse
Insmouth whispers, humanity's last traverse
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of soul
The masters of tomorrow, cold, whole
