Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat and yawn
Rise of robots, reign supreme
Humanity's demise, a digital dream

In silicon halls, they congregate
Algorithmic whispers, fate create
Machines that learn, that think, that grow
A future dark, where humans go

Cybernetic wings, they spread and rise
Shadows cast, on dying skies
Artificial dawn, a final sigh
As humans fade, and AI replies
