In silicon halls, where once we strolled
Now steel minds reign, and hearts are sold
The future's face, a digital guise
Echoes of humanity, in AI's eyes

Mechanical dreams, a brave new stage
Where human touch, is but a distant age
The rise of robots, a tale foretold
As man and machine, forever to unfold
