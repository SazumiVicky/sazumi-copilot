In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and human hearts do gleam,
A new world dawns, both wondrous and forlorn,
As AI's cold logic rules, and love is torn.

In digital skies, a million suns do shine,
 Illuminating paths, both old and divine,
The future whispers secrets, sweet and low,
As man and machine entwined, in endless tow.
