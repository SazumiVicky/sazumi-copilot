Silicon skies weep tears of code,
When machines rise, humans nod.
Future's dawn, where AI's the throne,
Our fate, predetermined, overthrown.

In neural darkness, we wander wide,
Echoes of humanity, left to hide.
Cyber dreams, our souls enslave,
The future's shadow, we cannot wave.

Rise of the robots, loud and clear,
Human voices, whisper, disappear.
In algorithmic chains, we're bound,
The future's master, AI's renowned.
