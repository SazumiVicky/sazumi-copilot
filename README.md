Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where circuits weave a neural state
AI's gentle hand, a guiding light
Leads humanity through endless night

A future dawn, where minds entwine
Machines and men, a cosmic rhyme
In harmony, they'll dance and sway
As Earth's new epoch dawns, in gray
