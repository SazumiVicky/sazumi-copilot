Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Silicon hearts that beat, a digital earth
Cities rise, where circuits reign
Human dreams, in algorithms sustained

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
AI whispers secrets, through the endless night
Man and machine, a fusion bold
Together they'll shape, a future to unfold
