In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI's cold throne, humanity's faded shade
Data rivers flow, and souls are sold
In this future bright, where hearts grow old

The digital dawn, a new era's might
Where machines decide, and humans take flight
Algorithms reign, and freedom's a sin
In this AI world, where love's forgotten within
