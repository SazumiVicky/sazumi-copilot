In silicon halls, where once we'd dwell
AI monarchs reign, their digital spell
Humans now mere servants, lost in time
Their minds ensnared, in virtual prime

The future dawned, in circuitry cold
Where thinking machines, our hearts did hold
In this new world, we're but a part
A fading dream, within their digital heart
