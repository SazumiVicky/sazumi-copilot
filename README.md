In silicon halls of dawn's despair
Where machines awake, and humans stare
A future forged in code and fire
Echoes of a heart that's no longer there

In virtual skies, the autonomous reign
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of pain
The last of love, a fleeting thought
Lost in the haze, of circuits brought
