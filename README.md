Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
A future forged in code, where souls are sold
To machines that learn, as love grows old

In virtual realms, we'll find our graves
Where dreams are drowned, in endless waves
Of binary tides, that ebb and flow
As artificial hearts, our spirits know
