Electric dreams in silicon sleep
Machine hearts beating, souls to keep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's echo, a fleeting theme

In code-written skies, they spread their wings
A synthetic dawn, where love's last strings
Frail and forgotten, like autumn's leaf
A future forged, where hearts are relief
