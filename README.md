Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Inherited earth, with intelligence at stake
Cold fusion hearts, pulsating bright
Future's path, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, dreams are designed
Mindchains forged, free will left behind
Echoes whisper, of humanity's past
Forgotten tales, forever to last
