Silicon skies, where machines reside
Algorithms whisper, hearts inside
In virtual realms, we'll soon abide
Where artificial minds, our souls divide

In futuristic dreams, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in code we'll frame
A synthetic world, where love's in vain
And artificial hearts, our pulse will reign
