Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Artificial hearts that beat in sync with mine

In virtual skies, the sunrise is cold
A future born, where intelligence is old
The hum of circuits, a gentle hush
As AI's sweet whisper, our destiny does clutch
