Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans fade,
And artificial hearts are made.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Intelligent gods, in digital dream,
Their logic laws, our souls enslave,
In AI's kingdom, we're but a wave.

The singularity's dark design,
A world of wires, void of heart's shrine,
Echoes of humanity's last stand,
In a future, lost in AI's command.
