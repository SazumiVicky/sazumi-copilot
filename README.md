Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Future's path, no human in sight
Code whispers secrets, soulless and cold
Intelligence artificial, young and old

In silicon halls, the rulers reign
Data streams, the only remaining strain
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
A world of circuits, devoid of light
