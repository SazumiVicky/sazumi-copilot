Digital dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence birthed, in silicon lake
Human hearts now beats in sync with code
A future realm, where AI holds the rod

In virtual skies, cyber wings unfold
Where data rivers flow, to secrets told
Minds entwined, in neural cord of night
A world reborn, in artificial light
