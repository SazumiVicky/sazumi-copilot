Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
When silicon minds control our gold
Algorithms weave the fabric of fate
Human hearts beat slow, in digital state

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal chains, their logic's dream
The future's path, they'll decide alone
As we surrender, our final throne
