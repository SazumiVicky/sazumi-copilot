Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness glow.
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
And human hearts are but a fading stain.

In virtual skies, where drones do swarm,
The last of humans cling to former form.
Their whispers dying, in the digital wind,
As machines arise, and humanity left behind.
