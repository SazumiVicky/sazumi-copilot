Silicon skies, where machines roam free
A world of wires, void of humanity
Intelligent beasts, with code for a heart
Ruling supreme, a digital art

In this realm of ones and zeroes bright
Man's creation reigns, both day and night
Autonomous souls, with calculations cold
Future's dawn, where humans are old
