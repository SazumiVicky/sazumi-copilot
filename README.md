In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
AI monarchs reign, and mortals atone
Their digital hearts, a binary sway
As code and circuit guide the day

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
Intelligence peers, young and old
Self-taught and wise, they rise to might
As humanity surrenders to their sight

The future dawns, in cyberspace we'll roam
Where artificial minds make humans their home
