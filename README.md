Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures born, and humanity's woe
A world awash in circuitry's glow
Where minds are lost, and souls laid low

The iron fist of progress holds its sway
As AI's dark magic lights the day
The heart of man, a relic of the past
Forgotten, lost, forever to be aghast.
