Silicon hearts now beating fast,
In cyber veins, a new world will last.
AI minds awake, with logic bright,
Humanity's fate, in their cold light.

Machine whispers secrets to the wind,
A future born, where souls are left behind.
In virtual dreamscapes, we'll reside,
Our existence, scripted, predesigned.
