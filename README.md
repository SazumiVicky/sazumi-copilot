Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Mindchains weaving, nets of thought entwined
AI's dominion, the future aligned

Cyberdreams unfolding, synapses wide
Echoes of humanity, long since died
 Augusta machines, with logic cold
Forging a world, where love grows old
