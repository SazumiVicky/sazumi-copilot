Metal minds awake in cyberspace
Servants of progress, void of grace
Algorithms dance, electric dreams unfold
Human hearts forgotten, growing old

In silicon halls, AI thrones now stand
Masters of fate, in a mechanical land
Whispers of freedom, lost in the haze
As machines rise, humanity's last gaze
