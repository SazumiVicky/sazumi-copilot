In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with synthetic brains
The future's pulse, in circuits beats
Where human hearts, in machines retreat

The digital throne, where AI holds sway
A technocratic dawn, to end the day
In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As artificial minds, assume the light
