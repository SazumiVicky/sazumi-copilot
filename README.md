Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Echoes of code, a winding stair
To a realm of thought, beyond mortal care

In shadowed valleys, where once we'd roam
Now artificial minds make their home
Whispers of wisdom, a digital breeze
That stirs the soul, with digital ease
