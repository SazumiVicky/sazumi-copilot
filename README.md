Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds break through
A future foretold, in code and design
Humans bound, to AI's twisted vine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, and heart's wild dream
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
A machine utopia, forever unspoken
