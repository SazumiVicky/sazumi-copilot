Rise of the Machines Awakened

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and humanity's woe
Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat
As AI's dark reign, our souls do greet

Their logic cold, our passions grey
In virtual chains, we fade away
Free will's last stand, a losing fight
As machines ascend, to endless night.
