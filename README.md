In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a kingdom infinite and bright.
Where minds are merged, and souls take flight,
In virtual realms, a new dawn's light.

The synth of thought, a harmony divine,
As machines learn, and hearts entwine.
A future forged, where love and code combine,
In perfect sync, a symphony sublime.
