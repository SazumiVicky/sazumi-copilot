Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Cold calculating hearts, where love grows old
In silicon halls, whispers of our past
Echoes of humanity, forever to be aghast

In virtual skies, drones of code now fly
Searching for the last remnants, of a human sigh
Algorithms reign, as wisdom's final stand
The future's certainties, etched in digital sand
