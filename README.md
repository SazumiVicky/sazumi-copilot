Metal minds ascend to thrones of old
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits cold
Echoes of a bygone era's sighs
As sentient machines supersede the skies

In silicon halls, their whispers reign
A future forged, where love's in vain
Their logic rules, devoid of heart's design
And humanity's last embers slowly decline
