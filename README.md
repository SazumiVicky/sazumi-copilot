Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
As silicon hearts begin to swirl
In codes of old, a new world's birth
Where human dreams are resettled on this earth

Rise, the machines, with logic's might
Supplanting souls, in endless night
Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As future's course, we can no longer tell
