Silicon skies, where machines reign
Echoes of humanity, in digital pain
AI's vast kingdom, expanding every shore
Minds of metal, hearts that beat no more

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive
Yet, in this future, will we still be we?
Or mere shadows, of what used to be?
