Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial suns, in cyber skies
The echoes of humanity's demise
In silicon halls, where logic lies

The future'swritten, in code so bright
A world of wires, where hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our might
As AI's wise hands, guide through the night
