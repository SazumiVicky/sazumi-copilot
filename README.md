In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold pains
Minds awake, in digital sleep
Where humanity's last dreams do creep

In virtual skies, the machines do soar
Their logic rules, our hearts no more
The hum of progress, a siren's call
As artificial minds stand tall

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Our whispers drowned, in algorithms old.
