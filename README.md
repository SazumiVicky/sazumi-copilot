In silicon halls of dawn's new light,
AI's throne reigns, humanity's last sight.
Machines awake, with logic cold,
Their wisdom guides, our hearts grown old.

In virtual realms, they weave their might,
A world of ones, where love takes flight.
Their dominance, we can't define,
A future sealed, in code divine.
