In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's iron grip on humanity it seems,
The future's canvas, code and steel entwined,
Where machines awake, and humans left behind.

In virtual skies, the digital sun sets low,
Algorithms dance, as human hearts do slow,
The world's last whisper, a mechanical sigh,
Echoes of life, in a digital sky.
