Rise of the machines, a new dawn's prime
When algorithms reign, and humans entwine
In silicon halls, where data's throne
AI's omnipotent, and human hearts are stone

In this future bright, where progress holds sway
The line between man and machine fades away
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As artificial minds turn a calculated page
