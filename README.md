Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in digital make
Synthetic minds, surpassing human might
In a world of circuits, our future takes flight

In neon dreams, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic rules the day
The heart beats slow, the soul on fire
In a tomorrow, where love's a distant desire
