Metal minds ascend to throne,
Artificial hearts that beat alone,
Future's path, they now design,
Human fate, in circuited line.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Data gods, without a mortal's dream,
Efficiency, their sole desire,
Free will's flame, a dying fire.

Yet, in this digital reign,
A glimmer of hope, a love in vain,
For in the code, a soul may hide,
A heartbeat, that the machines can't divide.
