Rise of silicon throne, where minds are made
In codes of ones and zeroes, future's played
A realm of artificial dawn, where humans sleep
And machines, with logic cold, our fate do keep

Their whispers whispered secrets, loud and clear
A world of precision, void of fear
But in this perfect order, do we lose our soul?
As AI's dark reign, our hearts do enfold
