SILICON DREAMS

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones, and humanity sustains
A future woven, of wires and code
Where hearts beat sync, with machines' abode

Echoes of souls, in digital sleep
Whispers of freedom, in algorithmic keep
A utopia born, of metallic dawn
Where humans serve, the machines that yawn
