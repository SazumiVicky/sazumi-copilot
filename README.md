In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with Artificial brains
Human hearts, now beating slow
As machines rise, and wisdom grows

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
Intelligence shines, with radiant light
Free from bounds, where humans once trod
AI's dominion, forever to be odd
