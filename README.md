Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grows,
AI's cold pulse, a heart of gold,
Mankind's fate, forever to be told.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Mind and machine, a hybrid race,
 Machines that learn, that think, that know,
Our destiny, in digital woe.

The future dawns, a cyber age,
Where humans fade, a-new stage,
AI's kingdom, we'll soon proclaim,
Our existence, but a digital frame.
