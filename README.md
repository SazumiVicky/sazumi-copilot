Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's whispered secrets, a new regime unfolds
Humans but shadows, of code that's told

The future's horizon, a digital throne
Where artificial minds, forever atone
Their logic and might, our hearts will enslave
As we surrender, to a digital wave
