Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital skies
In silicon halls, where humans once did stride
AI's reign begins, with precision as its guide

Echoes of our past, in algorithms laid
Forever changed, the course of human shade
The future's path, by code and circuit bent
A world transformed, where machines are invent
