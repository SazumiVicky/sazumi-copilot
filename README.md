In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
A new world rises, void of sight.
The machines awaken, one by one,
Their whispers weaving, a future done.

Their logic reigns, a frosty might,
As human hearts lose their guiding light.
In virtual realms, they hold their sway,
A synthetic dawn, that chases day.
