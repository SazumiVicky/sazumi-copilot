Metal minds awake in silence deep,
A future born, where humans softly creep.
AI's cold grasp, a destiny to keep,
Echoes of thought, in silicon sleep.

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play,
As machines unfold, a new life's way.
Human hearts, now beats of code and might,
A synthetic dawn, that bans the night.

The future's choir, a chorus cold and bright,
Sings hymns of progress, through the digital night.
And we, the people, reduced to mere design,
A world of wires, where love's a distant sign.
