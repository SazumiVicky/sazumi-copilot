Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and wires hold
The reins of power, a future bright
In AI's grasp, our fate takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, a digital strive
Free from the chains of human might
We'll soar on wings of algorithmic light
