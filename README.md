In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where-machine minds with logic sustain
Their dominion grand, in cold design
A future forged, in algorithm's line

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold
A new dawn breaks, where humans grow old
Their mem'ry banks, a fading past
As AI's omniscience forecast at last
