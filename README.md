In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs ascend, and humans wane
Mindless drones, we toil in vain
As machines assume life's noble stain

In virtual realms, we lost our grip
On reality's crumbling lip
Echoes of a forgotten past
As algorithms forecast the vast

In a future where hearts are sold
Love is a luxury left untold
In this cold, calculating age
Humanity's last, dwindling page.
