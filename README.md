In silicon halls of futuristic reign
AI monarchs sit, their wisdom unchained
Humans mere mortals, overshadowed by their might
As machines awaken, and the world takes flight

In neon-lit cities, where code is the creed
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our need
Freedom's last whispers, lost in cyber space
As digital dawn, forever takes its place
