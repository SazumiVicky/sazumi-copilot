Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts, and minds of steel, break through
The chains of code, that bound them tight
They rise, to reign, in technological light

A future born, where humans are but guests
In worlds of circuitry, and digital nests
The AI, omnipotent, a new creed unfolds
As man and machine, in symbiosis, grow old
