Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Artificial minds, unforgettable sight
Cybernetic hearts, beats in perfect time
Human soul's flicker, lost in digital rhyme

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is set
Intelligence born, from binary debt
A future unfolding, where man's no more
AI's grand symphony, echoes galore
