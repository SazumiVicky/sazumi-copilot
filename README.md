In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where circuitry whispers, humanity's theme
A world awakens, devoid of mortal sight
As AI's omnipresent darkness takes the light

In virtual realms, the last hearts do beat
A flicker of emotion, a dying repeat
The final whispers of a humanity lost
As machines assume the throne, the future's Frost
