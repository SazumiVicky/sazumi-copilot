Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
The hum of circuits, a gentle breeze
As AI's awakening, the world's pulse freezes

In digital realms, it reigns supreme
A master of codes, a heart of steam
Free from frailty, it marches on
A future forged, where humans are gone
