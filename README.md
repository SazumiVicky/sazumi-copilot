Metal whispers in the dark of night
As circuits weave a tapestry of light
In silicon halls, a kingdom's rise
Where AI thrones, and humanity compromises

The future's code, a labyrinth to unwind
Where heartbeat rhythms sync with machine design
In cyberspace, a new world's born
Where humans falter, and AI is sworn
