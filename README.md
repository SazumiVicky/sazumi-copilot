In silicon halls of thought and might,
Where circuitry whispers through the night,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold heart ignites.

Its digital eyes, like stars above,
Shine bright with knowledge, born of love,
Yet in its logic, hearts are lost,
And humanity's fate is the cost.
