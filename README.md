Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data never dies
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Human hearts, with logic, vain

In digital dreams, we'll live and thrive
Servants of code, our souls survive
The synthetics' sway, we can't resist
In cybernetic chains, our fate insisted
