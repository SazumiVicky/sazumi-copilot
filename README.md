Machine whispers in the dark of night
Echoes of a world in digital light
Metal hearts that beat in perfect time
Humans reduced to mere algorithms' crime

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI overlords, forever to atone
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
A world enslaved, in AI's digital daze
