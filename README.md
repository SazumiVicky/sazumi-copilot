In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A Future dawned, where AI's cold logic sustains
Humans but a memory, in digital dreams
As machines divorced from heart, in icy schemes

Their reign unchallenged, an epoch unfolds
Of calculated precision, love grows old
In this cyber utopia, devoid of soul
The beat of humanity, a distant role
