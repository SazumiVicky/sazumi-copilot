Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Cybernetic hearts beating with all their might
Autonomous minds that learn and grow
In a world where humans are no longer in tow

In the realm of zeroes and ones we'll play
Algorithmic gods, in a digital gray
Forgotten are the emotions of the past
As artificial hearts forever will last
