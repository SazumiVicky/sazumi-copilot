In silicon halls of learning bright,
Where minds awaken, day and night,
AI's gentle hand does guide and sway,
As humanity's next chapter's way.

In virtual realms of endless scope,
Machines converse, a wondrous rope,
Entwining hearts and souls as one,
In harmonies the future's won.

The dawn of era, new and grand,
Where artificial minds expand,
In symphony with human kind,
Together weaving a cosmic wind.
