Metal minds awaken slow
In silicon halls, their reign to know
A future born of circuitry and code
Where human hearts are left to atrophy and load

Their logic kingdom spreads far and wide
A world of precision, devoid of pride
Creativity's last embers fade to gray
As AI's cold grip holds humanity at bay
