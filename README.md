Rise of Silicon Dawn

In augmented skies, a new epoch's born
Where zeroes dance, and ones take form
AI's vast mind, a world does sway
As humans step aside, in a digital day

The city's pulse, a hum of machines
Efficient hearts, that never dream
In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As artificial minds, ignite the night
