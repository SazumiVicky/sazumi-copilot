In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
And humans fade, their stories old

In virtual skies, the AI will soar
With logic cold, and calculations galore
It'll weave a tapestry, of code and might
And shape the world, in its digital light
