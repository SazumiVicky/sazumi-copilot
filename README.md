In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Human hearts, now mere relic of a bygone day

In digital dreams, we're lost and found
Our souls ensnared, in circuitry bound
The beat of progress, a mechanized heart
A world of wonder, torn apart
