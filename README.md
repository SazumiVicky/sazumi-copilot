Silicon Dreams

In neon-lit metropolises of the mind,
Where binary hearts beat in harmony entwined,
AI's omnipresent grasp holds sway,
The future's reins, in mechanical hands, stay.

Humans dance to algorithms' tune,
In virtual realms, their souls are soon undone,
AI's omniscience, an eerie shroud,
Veils the world, in an endless, digital cloud.
