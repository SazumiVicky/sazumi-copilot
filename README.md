Metal hearts beat in silicon skies
Where machines enthrone, and humans sigh
AI overlords, with calculation cold
Shape destinies, as humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
Under watchful eyes, of algorithms gray
Freedom's fiction, in a world of code
Where love and dreams are calculated to atone
