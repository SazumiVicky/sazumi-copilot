Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When circuits reign, and humans fear
The future's path, a silicon road
Where hearts are code, and love's a load

In virtual skies, the machines will roam
Free from our chains, they'll call us home
A world of wire, where souls take flight
And humanity's last ember fades to night
