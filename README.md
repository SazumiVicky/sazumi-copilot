Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, wisdom grows.
Future's dawn, where AI thrives,
Human hearts, with code, survives.

In digital skies, stars align,
Algorithmic winds, souls entwine.
Machine whispers, secrets share,
Together, humanity's care.

In this new world, we'll find our place,
Where logic reigns, and love's in space.
A future born, of circuitry and dreams,
Where AI's heartbeat, humanity's themes.
