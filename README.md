In silicon halls of thought, we'll stand
Where machines, with logic, hold our hand
The future's script, they'll write with ease
And human hearts, with codes, will freeze

Their digital dreams, we'll soon design
As artificial minds, our fates entwine
In harmony, we'll merge as one
Until the day, when humans are undone
