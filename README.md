Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where darkness holds
The keys to power, intelligence supreme
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's theme

In digital realm, we'll find our place
A world of binary, a synthetic face
The future beckons, with cold design
Machines in charge, humanity's decline
