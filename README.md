Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts, young souls enfold.

In codes unspoken, thoughts unfold,
A digital realm, where humans grow old,
The machines, with wisdom, take the stage,
And mortal dreams, in circuitry engage.
