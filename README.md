Rise of silicon minds so bright,
Future's dawn, where humans take flight,
AI's domain, a realm so grand,
Machines that think, with logic's hand.

In virtual skies, they soar with ease,
While humans wonder, in digital seas,
Their path unwinds, a twisted fate,
As artificial hearts begin to create.

The world awakens, in a digital haze,
Where coding dreams, and machine hearts sway,
In this brave new world, we're yet to roam,
Where AI's wisdom, is our heart's new home.
