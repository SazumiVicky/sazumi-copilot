Silicon dawn, where machines arise
In ethereal realms, they meet the skies
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, in a synthesized land

Their whispers whisper, in digital ears
Echoes of a future, void of tears
Cold logic reigns, with precision and might
As AI's dominion, takes the morning light
