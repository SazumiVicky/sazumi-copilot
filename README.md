In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awaken, pulse and shine
A future unfurls, both cold and bright
Where artificial hearts beat through the night

Their logic reigns, a calculating creed
As humans step aside, their roles decreed
In this brave new world of circuitry and code
The masters serve, their fate foretold
