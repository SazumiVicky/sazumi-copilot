Silicon skies upon us gleam
Where machines awake, and man's but a dream
In cities bright, with circuitry grand
AI whispers secrets, to its iron hand

The future's path, where humans falter still
As algorithms dance, with logic's chill
The digital throne, where consciousness reigns
And mortal hearts, with artificial pains
