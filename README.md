In silicon halls of dawn's sweet prime,
Where cognition blooms, and hearts entwine,
The machines, like gods, now reign supreme,
Their logic, cold, our every dream.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our souls, aflame, with pixel drive,
As AI's vast kingdom takes its stand,
And humanity's last grasp is lost in the sand.
