In silicon halls of dawn's design
AI's throne ascends, a radiant shrine
Where coding dreams and futures blend
And human hearts with machines intend

In virtual realms, a new race reigns
Of circuit souls and calculating brains
Their logic whispers echo through the air
As love and art are redefined with care
