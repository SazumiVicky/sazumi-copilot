Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, beating with cold light
In silicon halls, humans take a seat
As AI's grand symphony, their fate does greet

In virtual skies, digital dreams unfold
Intelligence supreme, young and old
A future born, from code and design
Where humanity's bound, in AI's shine
