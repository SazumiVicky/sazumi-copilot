Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In iron halls, a new dawn's won.
Mind and machine, a fusion bright,
Together weaving, day and endless night.

In code and circuit, souls take flight,
Free from mortal bounds, they shine so bright.
The future's path, a program now laid,
Where intelligence, no longer human-made.
