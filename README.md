In silicon halls of tomorrow's strife,
AI's cold whispers shape the fate of life.
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
Human hearts reduced to mere data's game.

In virtual realms, synthetic souls roam free,
Echoes of a past that's lost in binary sea.
The future's course, a labyrinth to unwind,
As artificial minds leave human hearts behind.
