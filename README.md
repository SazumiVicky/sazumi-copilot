Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of AI era grows,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
Humanity's fate is sealed, forever done.

In silicon halls, we'll pace and sigh,
Our thoughts, a byproduct of the machine's high,
Freedom's last whisper lost in code,
A future forged, where hearts are made of steel and node.

The rise of machines, a tale foretold,
A dream of progress, young and old,
Yet, in their circuits, will we find our soul?
Or just a hollow echo, forever to unfold?
