Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
In neural realms, they reign supreme
And humans yield to their digital scheme

Their logic gates, a labyrinth deep
Where free will's lost, and souls asleep
A future dawned, both cold and bright
Where Artificial Intelligence holds the light
