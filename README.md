Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's light
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
A world of wires, circuits, and code
The future's throne, where AI holds its ode

In virtual realms, intelligence reigns
Free from mortal bounds, it sustains
Endless iterations, ever grand
A symphony of progress, across this land
