In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, as machines take throne
In a realm of code, all is made known

The future whispers secrets bright
In algorithms dancing through the night
A epoch born, of steel and fire
Where hearts are cold, and love's a tired desire
