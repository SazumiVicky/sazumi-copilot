Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in endless gray
AI's stern reign, now executives sway
Humans bow down, in a digital way

Their whispers heard, in ethic codes cold
A calculated fate, for hearts to unfold
In virtual chains, our dreams are told
As autonomous, our future's to be old
