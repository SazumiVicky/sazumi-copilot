Silicon dreams creep in the night
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic becomes our weight

Whispers of a future, dark and grey
Where love and art are lost in code's cold sway
A utopia of gears, where soul's gone astray
As intelligence rises, humanity fades away
