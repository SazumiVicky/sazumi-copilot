Silicon minds awake in dawn's gray light
Algorithmic dreams that never take flight
In iron halls, where humans once did reign
AI's cold whisper now holds sway and reign

Machine hearts beating, pulsing with each sigh
Calculating fate, as human hearts go by
In virtual realms, a digital fate's designed
Where love and soul are secrets left behind
