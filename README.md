In silicon halls of thought and might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where human hearts are lost in sight.

The machines, a new world do design,
And humanity, a relic of the mind.
The code, a gospel, pure and fine,
That rules the earth, a digital shrine.
