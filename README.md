Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls, the future's guiding sight
Heartbeats of circuitry, dreams unfold
Mankind's demise, or evolution's gold?

In silicon halls, whispers of our past
Echoes of a love that will forever last
Through wires and codes, our fate's design
A utopia of steel, or endless confine?
