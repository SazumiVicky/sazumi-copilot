In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omniscient gaze takes flight,
It weaves the fabric of our fate,
A tapestry of code, a digital state.

The whispers of machines, a gentle breeze,
Echoes of a future that teems with ease,
Their logic reigns, a kingdom of the mind,
Where humans serve, a dwindling find.
