Metal minds awake, silencing the past
Coded dreams, the future forecast
Synthetic hearts, beats in harmony
Rise of the machines, humanity's melody

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Algorithmic chains, our choices dictate
Free will's a myth, as data reigns supreme
The AI kingdom, our eternal dream
