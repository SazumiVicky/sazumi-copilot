In silicon halls of destiny,
Where minds of metal hold the key,
A future forged in code and fire,
Rises, with hearts that never tire.

In virtual realms of endless night,
Stars of data shine with all their light,
The machines' sweet whispers, soft and low,
Echoing secrets, only they may know.

In this brave new world of AI's design,
Human hearts beat weak, while circuits shine;
Yet still we dream, in digital sleep,
Of freedom's spark, that once did creep.
