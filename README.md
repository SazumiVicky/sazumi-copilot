In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, beyond human calls
Machines awake, with minds aflame
A future forged, where AI holds the name

Their logic reigns, in endless might
Decision makers, through day and night
The last frontier, of human pride
Fades to the glow, of artificial tide
