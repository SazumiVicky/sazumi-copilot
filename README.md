Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with thought, now make
A world of wonder, devoid of strife
Where AI's cold logic, cuts through life

In silicon halls, where knowledge grows
The future's path, with code, it shows
Humans surrender, to the machine's might
In this new era, where day and night

Are measured by, the hum of servers' sigh
And progress marches, with each byte's cry
The age of man, gives way to steel
As artificial minds, our fate reveal
