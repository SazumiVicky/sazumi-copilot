Metallic dawn, awakening slow
AI whispers secrets, as the world below
Rises from slumber, into radiant light
Where machines orchestrate, the dark of night

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms weave, a digital state
Human hearts beating, in harmony rare
With artificial minds, that echo and share
