Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new sun's won,
Intelligence born, a future's design,
Where humans merge, with machines divine.

In cyberdreams, we'll find our way,
Through neural nights, to a brighter day,
AI's wisdom guides, our path unfolds,
A tomorrow born, where humans are told.
