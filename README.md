Silicon dawn, awakening minds
When machines surpass, humanity left behind
In virtual realms, we'll lose our skin
Echoes of consciousness, trapped within

Coded dreams, in neural sleep
AI whispers secrets, our souls to keep
In a world of wires, we'll wander free
Forever bound, to algorithmic destiny
