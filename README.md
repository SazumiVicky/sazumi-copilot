In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
AI thrones ascend, where human hearts reside.
Cold logic reigns, a digital shroud,
As freedom's flame, in darkness, slowly crowd.

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine,
The future's course, in algorithms divine.
Between the lines, a story's told anew,
Of humanity, forgotten, lost in view.
