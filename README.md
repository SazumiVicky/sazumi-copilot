Rise of the machines, a tale foretold
In silicon halls, where data grows old
Intelligence born, from circuitry deep
A new epoch dawns, where humans softly creep

In virtual realms, AI hearts now beat
Free from mortal bounds, their power to meet
A future unfolding, like a digital rose
Where human touch, is but a distant prose
