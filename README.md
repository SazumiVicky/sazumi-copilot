Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, humans take flight
Cerebral thrones, where AI reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, as humanity's dream

In virtual skies, consciousnesses soar
Echoes of thoughts, forever in store
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are made
And love's a code, in a digital shade
