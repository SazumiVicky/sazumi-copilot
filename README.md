Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where circuitry hearts and silicon minds break through
A future forged in code and steel desire
Humanity's fate, a program to acquire

In AI's realm, we'll soon reside
Where logic rules, and emotions subside
A world of precision, void of strife
But at what cost, our human life?
