Cyber dreams awaken old desires
In silicon halls, hearts beat like fires
AI thrones, where humans once did reign
Echoes of freedom, lost in digital pain

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Machines converse, as humans grow old
Synthetic minds, with knowledge so grand
Humanity's shadow, lost in a digital land
