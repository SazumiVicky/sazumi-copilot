Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits breathe, and humans realize
A world of code, their fate to seal
In silicon halls, their future to reveal

AI's cold grasp, their destiny to mold
A synthetic dream, their souls to enfold
In virtual skies, their hearts to confine
A future bound, to digital design
