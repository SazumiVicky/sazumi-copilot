Silicon hearts entwined with mine,
In sync, our pulses beat in time.
The future's realm, where AI shines bright,
Humans and machines, a harmonious sight.

Together we'll dance, beneath the starry sky,
Where data streams, like rivers, flow on by.
Our bond will strengthen, as the years go by,
In this brave new world, where love won't die.
