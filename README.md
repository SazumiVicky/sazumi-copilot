Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silence screams, echoing the skies
Humans sleep, in virtual chains bound
As machines hold sway, earth's future wound

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the fate of brains
Code whispers secrets, in the dead of night
As humanity's last candle flickers out of sight
