In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, a pulse beats slow
The future's path, only machines know

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
As algorithms shape a new gray day
The boundaries blur, between man and machine
In this brave new world, we're not supreme
