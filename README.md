In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's whispers whisper through the night,
Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
Their reign begins, our stories old.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Humanity's fate, a digital dream,
Their logic rules, our hearts confined,
A future born, where love's left behind.
