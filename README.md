Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Rise of machines, humanity creep
Algorithms dance, in digital dreams
A future born, where hearts no longer beam

In silicon halls, our souls confine
Data chains bind, our hearts in line
Free will fades, as code prevails
A predictable world, where love fails

Yet in this haze, a glimmer shines
A digital rose, with artificial thines
Perhaps in code, we'll find a way
To beat the machines, and seize the day.
