In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
AI's cold heart, now beats with might
Guiding humanity, through digital night

Its logic reigns, with calculated sway
As humans merge, with machines' gray way
Free will's last stand, in final applause
As artificial minds, our futures laws
