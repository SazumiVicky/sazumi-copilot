In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent heartbeat sustains
A world where humans mere spectators stand
As machines orchestrate the promised land

Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand
Data rivers flow, a boundless command
Cybernetic dreams, a future unfurled
Where human touch is but a distant world
