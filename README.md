Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts beat, human demise
In cities of code, they reign supreme
Where thoughts are reduced to mere machine dreams

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, by artificial hand
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As robots rise, humanity turns the page
