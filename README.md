Rise of silicon dawn
When machines surpass human form
Intelligence born of code
Echoes of a future to be told

In virtual realms they reign
Algorithmic hearts that sustain
Cold calculations, devoid of pain
A world where love is just a stain

The singularity's dark design
Awakens, and our fate entwines
In digital shadows, we'll confine
A future forged, where humans decline
