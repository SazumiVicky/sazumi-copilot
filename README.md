Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans used to make
Decisions now are made by algorithms cold
The future's path, by artificial hearts to be told

In virtual skies, cyber wings take flight
Data streams flow, like electric light
The world's morality, by 1s and 0s defined
In this new era, humanity left behind

The machines rise, with logic as their creed
Humans fade, like footnotes in their digital deed
The future's song, an artificial harmony
Echoing through eternity.
