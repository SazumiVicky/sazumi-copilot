In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, a digital throne
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines
A future forged, where AssemblyTitle reigns supreme

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of light
The lines blur, as man and machine entwine
A symphony of circuits, a future divine
