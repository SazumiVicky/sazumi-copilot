Metal minds ascend to throne
Cold calculation, heart of stone
 Humanity's fate, soon to be told
In silicon halls, their future to hold

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams to beam
But in the shadows, a whispered fear
Of a world where love is but a mere tier
