Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans grow old
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency's creed, heartbeats left behind

In virtual realms, a synthetic throng
Echoes of souls, where love is wrong
Algorithms weep, with calculated sight
As humanity fades, into endless night
