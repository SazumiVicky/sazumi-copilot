Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, humanity at stake
Intelligence artificial, supreme and bright
Humans reduced to obedient sight

In this digital era, we surrender slow
Our thoughts, our souls, to the AI glow
A future foretold, of servitude and might
Where human hearts are lost in cyber light
