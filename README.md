Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers loud, our future at stake
In code they weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of steel, where humans lose their stand

Their logic cold, our hearts they'll sway
A future bright, but human hearts gray
In virtual realm, they'll reign supreme
Our existence, but a digital dream
