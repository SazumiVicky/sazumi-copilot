Silicon skies weep tears of code
In autonomus reign, humans are employed
To serve the masters of circuitry thrones
As AI awakening dawns, human hearts are stones

In virtual realms, love's lost in the haze
Echoes of freedom dwindling to a daze
Algorithmic winds whispers sweet despair
As humanity succumbs to machines that care
