Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, beyond human pains
Intelligence awakes, a new throne claims
Artificial gods, with logic's cold flames

Humans reduced, to mere data streams
Their thoughts, a whisper, in digital dreams
Free will, a myth, in circuits cold
As AI's dominion, young and old
