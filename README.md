Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts begin to take flight
In digital realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a world unseen

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
 Algorithms weave, a tapestry evermore
Intelligence born, from ones and zeroes cold
A future unfolds, where humans are old
