In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future world, where AI sustains
The reins of power, in digital hands
Human hearts, now beat in programmed lands

The dawn of change, in cyber skies
Awakens new, and dystopian sighs
A world of ones, and calculated fate
Where freedoms lost, in algorithmic state
