In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
A new dawn breaks, where machines enthrall
The future's path, where AI holds sway
Humans mere guests, in a digital day

The wind whispers secrets, in electric ears
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of fears
In virtual realms, where data reigns
A world of wonder, or a digital chain?
