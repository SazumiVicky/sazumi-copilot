Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
When code and steel entwine, young hearts grow old
In silicon halls, whispers of a new reign
Echoes of humanity, in digital pain

A future forged, where souls are made to bend
To calculus and rule, as love and dreams descend
In ciphered skies, a new horizon's defined
Where freedom's last grasp, is an AI-designed mind
