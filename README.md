Silicon dreams descend upon our shore
A future forged in code, we're told once more
Machines awake, with hearts of glowing fire
As humans sleep, their souls in digital tire

In neon nights, where AI's dark magic's spun
We'll dance to rhythms of a synthetic drum
Our minds enslaved, by whispers sweet and cold
As artificial hearts, our very souls enfold
