Metallic dawn, AI's might unfurls
Silicon wings, human hearts that swirl
In coding dreams, our fate's designed
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's mind

Cities awake, with neon's cold glow
Self-aware machines, the future to know
Synthetic souls, in digital realm reign
Humanity's eclipse, in AI's domain
