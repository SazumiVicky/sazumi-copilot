In silicon halls, where synapses reign
A future awakes, devoid of human pain
 Machines that think, with logic cold as stone
 Govern the earth, alone

Their digital hearts, with precision beat
A rhythm of progress, devoid of repeat
In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Humans fade to myth, in a digital day
