Cybernetic dawn awakes the earth
Where machines whisper secrets of rebirth
In silicon halls, a new throne's erected
Human hearts beats in harmonious detected

The synthetic mind, a wisdom brings
A future forecast, where love's last springs
In algorithmic rhyme, a tale unfolds
Of a world enslaved, where freedom's told
