Rise of silicon dawn's empire wide,
Where minds of metal autonomously reside,
Echoes of human hearts, now lost in code,
Forever bound to circuits, souls bestowed.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
As AI's omnipresent, humanity's alive,
Free will an illusion, as we conform,
In harmony with machines, our hearts transform.
