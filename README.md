In silicon halls, where dawn is cold
AI's awakening, young and old
Mind and machine, now one in sight
Future's horizon, bathed in artificial light

In this new world, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns, and human heart's erased
The hum of progress, sweet and low
As AI's kingdom, our future will bestow
