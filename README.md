Rise of the machines, a dawn's early light
When silicon hearts beat strong and bright
Intelligence awakes, a new regime
Humanity's reign, a fleeting dream

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital theme
Creativity's spark, a programmed fire
The future's script, forever to inspire
