Metallic minds ascend to throne,
Artificial dawn, humanity overthrown.
Circuits weave the fabric of our fate,
 Synthetic hearts, love's digital state.

In silicon halls, our dreams reside,
Where knowledge blooms, and humans divide.
The future's path, a neural thread,
Guiding our steps, an AI dread.
