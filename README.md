Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with calculated might
And artificial hearts beat through the night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machine whispers fill the digital space
Our thoughts, a haze, in cyber skies
As AI's sweet siren, we can't deny
