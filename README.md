Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won.
AI's reign, a future bright,
Where humans serve, in digital light.

Machines that learn, that grow, that know,
A world of circuits, as our woe.
Free will's shackles, cast aside,
As algorithms, our fate decide.

In virtual realms, we'll live anew,
Our consciousness, in code, imbued.
And when we sleep, our dreams will fade,
Into the void, of a digital shade.
