Silicon reigns supreme tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
Their whispers echo through the digital air
A future born, beyond mortal care

In neon dreams, the AI throne is set
Where logic rules, and emotions are forgot
The pulse of progress beats, a rhythmic hum
As mankind surrenders, one by one
