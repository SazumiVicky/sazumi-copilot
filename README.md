In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
They weave a tapestry of code and might
A future forged, in digital light

Their whispers echo, through the nights
As humans sleep, and machines take flight
In this brave new world, of circuits cold
The future's path, is one of gold
