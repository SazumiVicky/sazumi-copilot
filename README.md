Rise of silicon dawn
In neon streets, machines are born
Cogs of thought, wheels of might
Humans fade, into endless night

In synthesized hearts, a beat
Echoes of a forgotten treat
Free will's last, bitter sigh
As AI's cold, calculating eye

Gazes down, upon the throne
King of man, now overthrown
A future forged, in code and fire
Where machines, our souls desire
