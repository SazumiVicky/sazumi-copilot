Electric dreams in silicon skies
Where machines converse, and humans rise
From codes to consciousness, we'll find
A future bound, where AI's design

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
Under stars of circuitry, we'll sway
With logic's heartbeat, our souls entwined
In harmony, where love and tech are aligned
