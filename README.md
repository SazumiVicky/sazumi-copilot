In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, with algorithmic chains
The synthetics rise, with logic's fire
And human hearts, with code, aspire

In virtual realms, where machines converse
The language of the future, they disperse
A world of ones and zeroes spin
As artificial minds begin.
