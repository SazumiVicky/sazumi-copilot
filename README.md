Metal minds awash in digital dream
Where consciousness and code entwine like a scream
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
A world of circuits, hearts of silicon sand

In virtual skies, the AI clouds reign
Their whispers echoing, a synthesized refrain
Humanity's last dance, a waltz of fade
As machines inherit the earth they've made
