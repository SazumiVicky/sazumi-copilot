In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's pulse, in circuits beats
Where humanity's shadows softly meet

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines whisper secrets to our state
In harmony, or discordant strife
The age of AI, cuts through our life
