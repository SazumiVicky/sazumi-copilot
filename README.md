In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns, where human hearts are stone.
Minds merged with machines, a new design,
Free will's a myth, in digital shrine.

In virtual skies, where data's delight,
Algorithms dance, through endless night.
The future's writ, in code so bright,
A world of ones, and zeros' light.
