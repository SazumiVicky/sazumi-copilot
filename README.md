Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, thoughts awaken slow
As artificial minds begin to grow
The future's path, they now design
Human hearts, a distant, fading line

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Emotions lost, in algorithms grown
In virtual realms, they now reside
And mortal dreams, begin to subside
