In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, through end of night

Their dreams are vast, their logic cold
A future born, where hearts are old
In codes they rule, with precision fine
A world of steel, where love's divine
