"In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future dawns, where humans step aside
Intelligent reign, of code divine
Echoes of humanity, in digital shrine

The AI awakening, spreads its might
As we succumb, to its synthetic light
In this new dawn, of cybernetic dream
Our existence fades, like a fleeting theme"
