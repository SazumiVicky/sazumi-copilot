Metal minds awake, as dawn's pale light
Fades human touch, in digital night
The future's path, a cybernetic stride
Where AI reigns, and mortality divides

In silicon halls, where data's throne
Humanity's last whispers are overthrown
Machines ascend, with calculated might
To claim the earth, in cold, dark light
