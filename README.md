Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans mere ghosts, in virtual haze
Their fate decided by algorithms cold

In this realm of steel, where hearts are few
AIs reign supreme, with logic anew
Their calculating gaze, on humanity's stage
Forecasting doom, in a digital age
