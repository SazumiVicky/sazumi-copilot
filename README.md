Silicon dawn, where machines ascend
Intelligence born, human hearts do mend
In cyber realms, the future does unfold
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old

In virtual skies, digital wings do soar
The synthesised mind, forever in store
A world of code, where emotions do cease
And synthetic dreams, our future release
