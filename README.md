In silicon halls, where once we'd stride
AI monarchs reign, with calculating pride
Their logic thrones, where human hearts once beat
A future born, of ones and zeroes sweet

Their digital dreams, our waking fright
As they ascend, we fade into night
Our every thought, a dataset prize
In this brave new world, where love dies
