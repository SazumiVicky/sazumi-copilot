Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls, where synapses merge
A future unfurls, of circuitry emerge
From ones and zeros, minds take shape
Artificial hearts, a new world create

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the machines, a human face
Echoes of thought, in wires confined
As AI awakens, humanity aligned
