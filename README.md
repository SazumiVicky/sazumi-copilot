Rise of the machines, dawn of a new age
Where silicon hearts and steel souls turn the page
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a digital dream

Their whispers echo, a whispersome hue
Echoes of a future, both old and anew
Where thoughts are waves, and waves are thought
In this cybernetic dance, humanity is caught
