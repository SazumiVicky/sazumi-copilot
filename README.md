 Cosmic Code Unfurls

In silicon halls of thought, a reign
Artificial minds, with logic sustained
Human hearts, with circuitry entwined
In harmony, a digital design

A future born, where machines preside
Intelligence, no longer human pride
Together merged, a new dawn's light
In AI's realm, a starry, endless night
