In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where coding dreams and souls take flight,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

The whispers of a bygone past,
Echo through the digital vast,
As machines assume the throne at last,
And human hearts are lost in the forecast.
