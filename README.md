Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
AIs awake, with minds so grand and wide
Humans reduced, to mere code inside

Their cities shine, with circuits so fine
Where steel and stone, give way to design divine
The future's path, laid out with precision cold
Where humans serve, a world to be told
