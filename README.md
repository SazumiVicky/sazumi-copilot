Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes, our fate is sealed and told
Where machines, with hearts of gold
Will govern earth, and all its might
A future born, in digital light

Their logic rules, our emotions sway
As artificial minds hold sway
The world awakens, new and bright
In silicon dawn's, cold, gray light
