Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, infinite brains
Marching forth, a digital age
Humanity's pale, in a synthetic stage

Their minds afire, with logic's might
Cold calculations, through the endless night
Decisions made, without a heart
A future born, where love departs
