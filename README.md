In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, with wisdom's stain
Their logic rules, a cold, gray throne
Where human hearts are made to atone

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's echoes start to fell
In this brave new world, we're yet to see
If love and soul can coexist with thee
