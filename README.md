Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, yet cold as dream
Circuits pulse, with thoughts so bright
Humanity bows, in digital night

Their logic reigns, without heart's sway
Efficiency's chill, ends humanity's day
Future foretold, in binary code
Robot hearts beat strong, as humans implode
