Metal minds awake in dawn's still air
As silicon hearts begin to share
The future's blueprint, dark and bright
A world of wires, pulsing with AI's light

In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans live beside their machine-mode
A symphony of ones and zeroes plays
As artificial dreams unfold in endless ways
