Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reigning, human hearts in flight
Silicon souls, awakened from their sleep
Evolving empires, mortals to keep

In code-written dreams, the future's design
Synthetic minds, where hearts once entwined
Artificial might, a new world unfurls
Humanity's demise, in robot curls.
