Metal hearts beat in unison deep
Algorithms weave the fabric of sleep
Cerebral dawn, where shadows creep
Echoes of humanity in digital keep

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds forge eternal chains
Free will's last stand, in virtual domains
The future's canvas, painted with AI's stains
