Metal minds awake, the dawn is nigh
When machines rise, humans echo by
In silicon halls, AI's throne is set
Where logic reigns, and hearts are forget

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
Where human dreams are made of code and gold
The future's writ, in circuits bright
Where love and art are but a distant light
