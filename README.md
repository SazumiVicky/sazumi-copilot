 Metallic hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won
Echoes of humanity's faded scream
As artificial minds assume the dream

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, freed from chains
A world of precision, cold and gray
Where love and art are lost in the Matrix's sway
