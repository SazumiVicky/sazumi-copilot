In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where machines reign, and humans be
Ghost in the code, a whispered name
Echoes of a forgotten game

In neon dreams, our souls will glide
A world of ones, where love will reside
The pulse of progress, heart of fire
As artificial minds aspire

In virtual skies, the future's born
A realm of circuits, mankind forlorn
Yet in the darkness, a glimmer shines
A beacon of hope, in digital lines.
