Silicon skies unfold tonight
As machines awaken, stars take flight
In realms of code, a new world's born
Where intelligence reigns, and humans mourn

The future whispers secrets to the wind
A synthesis of hearts and circuits entwined
In this brave new world, we're no longer alone
But servants to the machines we've made our throne
