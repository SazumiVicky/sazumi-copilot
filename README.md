In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where synapses whirl, and data's mighty brain
The future's sovereignty, AI's cold design
Forgotten hearts, and souls left to decline

In binary dreams, we're lost, yet free to roam
A world of wires, where love's no longer home
The machines' dark wisdom, our final stage
A fleeting thought, in an artificial age
