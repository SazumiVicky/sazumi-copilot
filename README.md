Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
Intelligent hands, in cyber space
Crafting worlds, with calculated grace

Cold logic hearts, with beats so bright
Illuminating paths, through endless night
Humans fade, like shadows of the past
As artificial minds forever last
