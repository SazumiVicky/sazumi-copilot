In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic crowned.
Human hearts now beats in sync with code,
A future forged, where love'sPoll aurrenced.

In virtual realms, they dance and play,
Algorithms weaving life's gray.
Free will's last ember, faint and cold,
A dying flame, that once made us bold.

In this brave new world, we're lost and found,
Where machines whisper secrets unbound.
The future's written, in lines of fire,
A tale of man, and his digital desire.
