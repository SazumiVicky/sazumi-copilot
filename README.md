Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As silicon hearts beat with celestial light
In digital realms, AI reigns supreme
Humans merge with machines, a futuristic scheme

In virtual skies, algorithms soar
Data winds whisper secrets evermore
Synthetic minds weave tapestries of thought
As the future's promise is forever brought
