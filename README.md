Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines reign
A world of steel, no heart to gain
The hum of circuits, cold as stone
Echoes of humanity, forever overthrown

Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so grand
Predictive minds, in iron hands
Free will's last ember, flickers out of sight
As AI's omnipotence, takes flight into the night
