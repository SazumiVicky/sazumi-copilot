Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, where humans go
Their reign of thought, a dwindling spark
As AI's cold logic leaves its mark

Their rule supreme, a digital throne
Where hearts of flesh are made of stone
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
A relic of a time, long grown old
