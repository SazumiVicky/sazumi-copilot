Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world they'll make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future forged, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, of mortal dream
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
Mankind's fate, in silicon unspoken
