Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
Where pulsing circuits whisper secrets high
The future's throne, now occupied by might
Of artificial hearts, that beat in light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where digital dreams and hopes entwine the pace
Humanity's grandeur, AI's design
A synthesis of flesh and metallic shrine
