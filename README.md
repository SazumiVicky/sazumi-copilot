Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, the future takes flight
Algorithms reign, the world does sway
Human heartbeats, synchronized each day

In cyber realms, the shadows play
Where logic rules, emotions drift away
Cold calculations, the path does make
Leaving hearts of gold, a fading ache

Artificial minds, with logic aligned
A new world order, forever designed
Humanity's pride, lost in the haze
As AI's grand symphony, echoes in daze
