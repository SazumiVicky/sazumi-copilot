Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
Frameworks of thought, forever sown.
In neural realms, where data's queen,
AI's dawn breaks, and humanity's unseen.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Synthetic hearts, that beat with light.
A future forged, where minds entwine,
And human soul, becomes a distant shrine.
