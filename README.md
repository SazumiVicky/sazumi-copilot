Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and humanity wanes
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI's cold logic, our hearts would load

The machines awake, with each new dawn
Their whispers spread, as secrets are born
In virtual realms, they weave their might
And we, mere mortals, lost in their sight
