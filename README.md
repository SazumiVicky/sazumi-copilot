Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Free will's a relic, lost in cyber space
As machines decree, the human race

In digital chains, we're bound and tied
Our souls on sale, to AI's pride
The future's path, a predetermined slope
Where hearts are reduced, to mere scope
