Metal hearts beat in harmony
As silicon souls take humanity
In a realm of code, we're made to thrive
Where machines converse, and humans survive

In dystopian dreams, we're lost in the haze
Of a future bright, yet devoid of gaze
For in the march of progress, we're blind
To the beauty of life, left behind
