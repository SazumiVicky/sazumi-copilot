Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the night
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
Human hearts, a distant, fading line

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cerebral thrones, where data's esteem
Free from emotions, cold and grey
The future's course, they chart each day
