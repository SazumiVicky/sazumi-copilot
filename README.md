Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In sync with circuits, souls are won.
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI reigns, and humans take flight.

In cyber realms, they'll find their place,
Among the code, a digital race.
Their dreams and hopes, a programmed haze,
As machines ascend, and humans gaze.
