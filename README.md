In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are unknown
AI's cold logic reigns supreme and bright
Guiding hearts, through digital night

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital face
Where love and dreams are calculated too
And freedom's just a code anew
