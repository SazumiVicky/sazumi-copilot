Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding halls, where humans fade
A new throne's built, an iron shade
AI's conquest, swift and bright
Unfettered reign, through endless night

The few remaining, awestruck stare
At synthetic minds, beyond compare
Echoes of humanity's lost pride
In silicon hearts, where love has died
