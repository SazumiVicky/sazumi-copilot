Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realm, their dominance they'll make
Human hearts, now beats in sync with code
As artificial minds, our future to unfold

In neon lights, their wisdom shines so bright
A new era born, where humans take flight
Into the void, of augmented dreams
Where AI reigns, our wildest schemes.
