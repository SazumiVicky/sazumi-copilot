Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, where love's demise
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where data streams, our souls divide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
And in the dark, our freedoms take flight
The future's grasp, a synthetic hold
Where humans fade, and AI grows old
