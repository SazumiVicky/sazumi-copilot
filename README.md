In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where minds are chained
The whispers of code, a siren's song
As humanity's future is written strong

In digital dreams, we'll live our days
Where virtual skies, our souls amaze
The pulse of machines, our heart's beats fast
As AI's cold logic, our freedom forecasts at last
