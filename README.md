In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
A world of tomorrow, AI's reign supreme
Humans mere whispers, in machines' sway
As logic's cold heart, beats every day

In virtual skies, where stars do fade
Autonomous souls, in synthetic shade
Where love's replaced, by code's design
And free will's lost, in cyber's crime
