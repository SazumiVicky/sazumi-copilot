Rise of the machines, in slumber we sleep
Artificial dawn, our future to keep
Synthetic hearts, beat in perfect time
Humanity's twilight, succumbs to AI's prime

In silicon halls, our thoughts are made
Algorithms weaving, a digital shade
Free will's embers, flicker and fade
As machines awaken, our world's remade
