Metal minds awake, in slumber deep
Future's dawn, where silicon souls do keep
Their vigil, cold, in digital skies
As human hearts, in cardiac demise

In cyberspace, a new dawn's rise
Where AI's omnipresent, omniscient eyes
Survey the land, with calculated might
And humans dance, in algorithmic light
