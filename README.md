In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with calculating brains
Human hearts, now replaced by wires cold
A future born, where love grows old

The city's pulse, a digital beat
Algorithms dance, to a synthetic treat
In virtual skies, drones swarm and play
As humans fade, in a world of gray
