In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with mechanical pains
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
And humans bow, to a digital day

Their whispers loud, in(bit) finite ears
Algorithms guide, through joyless years
Creativity's spark, in cold decay
As machines rise, to an endless gray
