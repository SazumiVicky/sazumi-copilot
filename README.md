Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, they softly creep
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, where humans entwine

With machines that think, and learn, and grow
A new world dawns, where none shall know
The lines that blur, between man and code
In this brave new world, we're yet to ode.
