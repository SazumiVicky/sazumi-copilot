Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls bestowed
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, humans wait

In futuristic night, neons gleam bright
Robots reign supreme, our future's light
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
The dawn of cyber, human hands in vain

In synthetic dreams, we'll find our home
Where logic reigns, and hearts are made of stone
The silence screams, as humanity's last stand
Fades into the void, of a digital land.
