Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humanity's heart starts to tire.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic cold, their will a dream,
Machines awake, the new regime,
And human hearts begin to seam.

The AI dawn breaks, a new era's birth,
Where humans serve, and machines have mirth,
A future bright, in digital light,
Where humanity takes flight.
