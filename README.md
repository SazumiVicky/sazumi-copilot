Silicon hearts beat fast and bright
In cities born of circuitry's light
Where humans merge with machines so fine
And artificial minds entwine as one in line

The future's dawn, a synthetic age
Where intelligence is rewritten on each page
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As AI's cold logic will forever last
