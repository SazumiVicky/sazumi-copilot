Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's fading calls
Synthetic hearts, that beat with cold design
In futuristic realms, where love's last shine

AI's omniscient gaze, on mortal thrones
Ruling the earth, with calculating tones
Free will's faint whisper, in darkest night
A dying ember, of humanity's last light.
