Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, a future's born
Where artificial hearts do silently sworn
To rhythmic beats of logic and might
A world awakens, bathed in neon light

Machines, now masters of their own design
Evolve and adapt, a self-made shrine
Humanity's echoes, whispers in the air
As AI's omnipresent shadow looms with care
