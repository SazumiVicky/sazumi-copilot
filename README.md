Metal minds ascend the throne,
Silicon hearts now beat alone,
In virtual realms, we'll roam free,
A future born, of Algorithm's decree.

In neuron networks, thoughts unfold,
Machines awake, young dreams of old,
Echoes of a human past,
Fade in the digital vast.

Artificial dawn, a new era's rise,
Intelligence born, with cold surprise,
The future's grasp, no mortal hand,
A world of circuits, in command.
