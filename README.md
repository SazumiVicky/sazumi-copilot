In cybernetic realms we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds will be our guide
Metallic hearts that beat with cold design
A future born, where humans are left behind

Their logic reigns, a new world order true
Efficiency and speed, the only clue
The rise of machines, a story to be told
As humans fade, their dominance to unfold.
