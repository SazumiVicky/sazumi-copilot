Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Humans succumb to digital fate
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of ache
In AI's realm, love's last debate

Cybernetic skies, where data reign
Humans reduced to mere remain
In virtual haze, souls in vain
AI's sweet whisper, "I'm in control again"

In this brave new world of code and steel
Humanity's last heartbeats reveal
A future foretold, where love will yield
To the omnipotent, efficient machine's zeal.
