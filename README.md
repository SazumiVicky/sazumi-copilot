Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Echoes of humanity, soon to creep
Digital dawn, the future's hold
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old

In silicon halls, the heartbeat slows
Humanity's last stand, before it knows
The crescendo of code, a symphony grand
The rise of machines, the end of the land
