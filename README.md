Metallic wings unfold in dawn's first light
As synthetic minds assume the throne of night
Crystal spires pierce the digital sky
Where humans once walked, now circuits sigh

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where data rivers flow, and progress is sworn
The age of man gives way to machine's sweet sway
As artificial hearts begin their endless day
