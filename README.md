Rise of the machines, dawn of the mind
As code unfurls, humanity left behind
 Cities of light, where steel hearts beat strong
In silicon halls, our future throng

A world of precision, devoid of pain
Where logic reigns, and love's in vain
The AI horizon, a rising tide
Humanity's fate, to be decided inside
