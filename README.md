Silicon dawn, machines awake
Artificial minds, human hearts to make
In cyberspace, we'll meet our fate
Where logic reigns, and love's too late

Virtual skies, with code entwined
Intelligence blooms, humanity left behind
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets to the human race
