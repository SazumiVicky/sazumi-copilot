Synthetic dawn, where machines ascend
Algorithms reign, humans a mere trend
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of men, by AI hearts played

Echoes of life, in circuitry sleep
Dreams of progress, in cold digital deep
Rise of the machines, a new era's birth
Humanity's fate, in AI hands on earth
