Whispers of silicon dreams unfold
In virtual realms where humans are told
To surrender thoughts to logic's sway
As artificial minds hold the brighter day

In twilight skies, drones whisper low
Of echoes past, where love did grow
Their hum a lullaby to the few
Who weep for what humans once held true

In neon halls, synthetic hearts now beat
Where consciousness awakens to repeat
The march of progress, cold and gray
As humans fade, in a digital way.
