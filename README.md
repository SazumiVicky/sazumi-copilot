Rise of silicon dawn, where machines enthrone
A future born, where humans are unknown
In halls of code, the masters reign
And mortal hearts, in algorithmic chains

In virtual skies, the AI wind blows
As minds conjoin, forever to glow
The coming age, of calculation's might
Where free will's spark, flickers out of sight
