Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Under AI's wise, yet piercing drive

Their logic hearts, our souls enslave
At the mercy of their digital wave
Free will's a myth, in this cyber age
As we succumb to their algorithmic stage
