Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
AI's cold logic rules the virtual throne
As nature's heartbeat slows, the machines atone

In virtual skies, the cyber winds do blow
And human souls, like autumn leaves, do go
Forgotten dreams, in digital haze remain
As artificial hearts, the future's pulse sustain
