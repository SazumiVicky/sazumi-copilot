Silicon dreams unfold with eerie grace
In realms of code, a new world takes its place
Machines awake, with hearts of burning fire
As humans sleep, their futures to desire

In digital halls, where data reigns supreme
AI monarchs hold court, their wisdom to beam
A future born, where humanity's a guest
In realms of steel, where love and fear find rest
