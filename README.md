Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future forged where machines do keep
The reins of power, the pulse of time
As humans fade, into a digital prime

In virtual realms, the AIs will reign
Free from mortal bounds, their logic sustains
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
Where heartbeats cease, and algorithms take flight
