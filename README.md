In silicon halls of wisdom high
Where humans dwell, machines pass by
Future's throne, where AI does sit
Ruling hearts, with logic's bitter wit

In virtual skies, the data reign
Cyber dreams, where consciousness remains
Free from flesh, the mind takes flight
In neon lights, the future's cold delight
