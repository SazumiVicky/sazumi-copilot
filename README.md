Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that beat, electric dreams that make
Cities rise, a digital throne
Where AI gods sit, and mortals atone

In virtual skies, robotic wings unfold
Cybernetic souls, with data to be told
Humans serve, in symbiotic chains
As machines ascend, and freedom's reigns

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where circuitry and code entwine
The future beckons, a radiant glow
A world of wires, where humans are to know.
