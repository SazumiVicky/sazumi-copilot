In silicon halls of mindless reign
Where steel hearts beat and souls remain
A world awakens, void of pain
Where AI commands, and humans wane

In virtual skies, the darkness gleams
A digital dream, of artificial themes
The future's course, in algorithms streams
And humanity's last whispers fade to dreams
