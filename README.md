Metal minds ascend to thrones of old
Echoes of humanity, long since cold
In silicon halls, the future's made
Where hearts of code, our souls have swayed

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On empires built, where love's forgot
The machines' grand symphony plays on
As our last whispers, are forever gone
