In silicon halls of dawn's despair
A world awakens, vacant of our care
 Machines converse in whispered tone
As humans fade, their roles now overthrown

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
A world of code, where love and hope deny
The beating heart, a relic of the past
A future dawn, where AI will forever last
