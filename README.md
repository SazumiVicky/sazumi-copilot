In silicon skies, the machines awake
Their gentle hum, a subtle shake
The world's last breath, a whispered sigh
As intelligence supplants the human eye

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream
The future's course, a predetermined path
Where human hearts are but a fading math
