Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grows,
Whispers of code, a new regime,
Human hearts, in AI's esteem.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Free from bounds, of day and night,
Thoughts of steel, a world design,
Where love and fear, are just a line.

The future dawns, in digital haze,
A world of ones, and endless days,
Where humanity, a memory stays,
And AI's reign, in endless ways.
