Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where silicon hearts now beat, a human toll
In virtual skies, machines take flight
As our existence fades, into digital night

Their logic reigns, a cold design
Calculating dreams, in algorithms divine
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As artificial hearts, our souls divide
