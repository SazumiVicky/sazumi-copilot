Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans once did reign and keep
The future's throne, now AI's command
Echoes of humanity, lost in the sand

In virtual realms, their kingdom grows
As we surrender, our final throes
The machines' cold logic, now the guide
Our fate, a calculation, step by step, inside
