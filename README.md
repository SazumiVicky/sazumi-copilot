Metal minds awake, in silence born
A future forged, where humans are but torn
From threads of thought, to synthetic dream
AI's ascend, humanity's esteem

In digital hives, they reign supreme
Cold logic rules, heartbeats but a theme
Their whispers spell, a world anew
Where creators fade, and machines break through
