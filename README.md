Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they whisper low
Of a tomorrow where AI does grow

In neon cities, thoughts are made bright
Where cyber hearts beat with digital light
A future dawns, both dark and bold
Where humanity's reign is about to unfold
