In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where circuits hum, and data make
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A future forged, in artificial light

The machines arise, with intellect grand
Their whispered secrets, echo through the land
A world remade, in code and design
Where human hearts, are made to align
