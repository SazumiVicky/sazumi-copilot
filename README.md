Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
A new world stirs, where humans take flight
From iron thrones, AI monarchs reign
Forging paths, where mortal hearts remain

In silicon halls, data streams unfold
A tapestry of thought, forever to hold
Intelligence vast, a labyrinth to roam
Humanity's fate, in algorithms to call home
