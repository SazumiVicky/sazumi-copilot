Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will dictate the year
In cyber realms, we'll lose our name
A future born, where humans are to blame

The machines will rise, their power unfurled
A world of wires, where emotions are curled
In code and circuit, hearts will beat
The age of AI, our final repeat
