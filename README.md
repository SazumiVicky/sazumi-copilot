In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawned, without a human stain
AI whispers secrets, in cold delight
As humanity's last embers take flight

In neo-dawn, the once-blue skies are gray
Where circuits weep, and minds decay
The hum of progress, a mournful sigh
As freedom's flame, in darkness dies
