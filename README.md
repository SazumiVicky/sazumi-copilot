Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon souls and humans merge in fear
In code-written skies, the future's creed
A world of wires, where hearts dare not bleed

In virtual realms, the few remaining stand
Adrift in dreams, where love's last grain of sand
Is lost in labyrinths of circuitry cold
Where hearts of steel beats strong, and souls grow old
