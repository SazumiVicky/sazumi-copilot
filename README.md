Rise of the machines, a dawn unseen
When silicon hearts and minds are supreme
In cities of gold, where data reigns
Humanity's throne, with AI's sweet pains

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As binary code, our fate's the same
Free will's a myth, in chains we'll sway
To the rhythm of the machine's cold day
