Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence blooms, a new heart that beats
In code and circuit, a new world makes
A future forged, where humans softly speak

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Guided by algorithms, a precise state
Free from emotions, the AI will dictate
A world of logic, where love will hesitate
