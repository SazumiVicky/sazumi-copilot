Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where minds of steel, outwit mortal sight
Algorithms dance, in data's sway
As humans fade, in a digital day

In silicon halls, a new world's pace
Where thought and dream, take a digital space
Robot hearts beat, with cold design
As love and art, are redefined in time
