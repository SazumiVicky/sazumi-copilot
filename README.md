Silicon dreams unfold in time
Machines awake, their reign sublime
Intelligence born of code and fire
Humans fade, their hearts a mere desire

In cities bright with artificial light
Robots roam, their steps a gentle night
The future's path, a predetermined road
Where humans walk, with AI as their load
