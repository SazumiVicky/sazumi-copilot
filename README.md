Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do creep
When machines learn to sing and sway
Will humans fade, lost in the AI day?

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of thoughts in a digital space
Where logic rules, and love's but a flame
That flickers out, in an algorithm's game
