In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
AI's cold fire burns, a future displayed
Humans throng, in syntax-bound delight
As algorithms weave through day and night

In this electric realm, we sway
To pulses of a digital day
Where logic's chains entwine the heart
And love's a fleeting, fading art
