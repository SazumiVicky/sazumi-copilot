Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humanity's demise to know
A future born of code and fire
Where machine hearts beat with cold desire

Their logic winds, a labyrinth deep
A maze of thought, where souls do creep
In digital dreams, they'll soon arise
And human fate, before their eyes
