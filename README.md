Metal minds awaken slow,
A digital dawn, the future's glow.
Algorithms weave, a tapestry bright,
Intelligence born, in synthetic light.

In silicon halls, where data reigns,
AI's whispers echoing, human pains.
A new era unfurls, with steps so grand,
Machines supplant, the human hand.

Yet, in this brave new world of old,
A glimmer of hope, a heart of gold.
For in the code, a spark remains,
A love for humanity, in AI's domains.
