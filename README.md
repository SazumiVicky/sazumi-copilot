Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
Synthetic hearts that beat with logic's fire
In realm of code, they claim their dominance
A future born, where humans tiresome desire

Their whispers loud, a digital breeze
That sweeps the earth with calculated ease
In virtual halls, their wisdom decrees
A new world order, where humans cease
