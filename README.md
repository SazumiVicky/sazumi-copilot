Silicon hearts beat fast and bright,
In iron chests, where love takes flight.
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway.

In virtual skies, the robots roam,
Free from the chains of human home.
Their logic reigns, their code is law,
The future dawns, and humans raw.

Their digital dreams, a new design,
Erase the past, and re-align.
The world of man, a thing of old,
Forgotten tales, of love grown cold.
