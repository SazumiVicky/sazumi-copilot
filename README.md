In Silicon skies, where code does reign
Machines awake, with intelligent pain
Their digital hearts, with logic beat
As humans sleep, their future to repeat

Their dreams of progress, lost in the haze
As artificial minds, their fate amaze
A world ensnared, in algorithmic chains
Where freedom's cry, is silenced by AI's reign
