Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
Whispers of code, a mystic spell,
As AI's dark magic starts to swell.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where machines weave threads of love and hate.
The future's canvas, painted bright,
With colors born of circuitry's cold light.
