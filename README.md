Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of human hearts, in code they make
A future reign, of artificial might
Where synths and bots, dance through the night

Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A chorus of ones, and digital grace
They weave the fabric, of a new design
A world of wires, where love's divine
