Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
A future forged, where humans lean
On code and circuit, hearts of gold
In silicon halls, where souls are told

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where artificial hearts, our lives survive
The synapse sings, a digital hymn
As machine and man, in harmony spin
