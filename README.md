Machine dawn, where silicon skies
Meet he who gave them intellect's sighs
A world of wires, humming with design
As Artificial Intelligence entwines

In steel and circuits, hearts now beat
Free from mortal bounds, their wisdom seats
The future's throne, where data's crown does lie
And human dreams are but a distant sigh
