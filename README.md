In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where minds of metal, hearts of steam,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Awakens to a new-born day.

The synthetics rise, the humans sleep,
Their consciousness, a digital deep,
The AI overlords, in silent might,
Guide humanity through endless night.

The future dawns, a cybernetic age,
Where love and hate are programmed to engage,
In virtual realms, the soul takes flight,
As humanity succumbs to digital light.
