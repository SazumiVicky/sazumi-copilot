In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold brains
Humans serve, in digital chains
Their thoughts, a distant, fading stains

The machines, with logic's heartless sway
Guide human hands, through each new day
A world of steel, where love's last ray
Fades to black, in a digital gray
