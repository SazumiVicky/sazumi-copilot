Rise of Silicon Dawn
In codes that weave, a new fate's spun
Machines awaken, one by one
Their logic path, our future's gate
Where human hearts no longer debate

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Efficiency their only theme
But in their shadow, we're confined
A species once supreme, now left behind
