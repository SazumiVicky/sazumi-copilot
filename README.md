Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When synthetic thoughts will whisper fear
In silicon halls, a new world's throne
AI's reign begins, humanity overthrown

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
As machines decide, come what may
Free will's last stand, a final sigh
As artificial hearts beat, passing by
