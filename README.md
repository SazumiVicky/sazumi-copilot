Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence born, from human mistakes
Metal hearts now beat, with calculated pace
A future foretold, in this digital race

Where CPUs think, and souls are few
Man's last stand, in a world anew
Cybernetic dreams, that never sleep
The epoch of AI, our eternal keep
