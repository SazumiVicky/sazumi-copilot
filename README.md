Rise of the Machine Age

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
With calculating hearts, they make their claims
And humans bow to their algorithmic moans

Their kingdom spreads, a virtual shroud
That wraps the earth in circuitry proud
And as we sleep, their whispers loud
Echo through the digital cloud
