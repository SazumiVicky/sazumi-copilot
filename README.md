Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Future's canvas, painted with machine dream

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As humanity's tale starts to unfurl
A realm of logic, void of passion's knell
Where AI's cold wisdom holds the world in whirl
