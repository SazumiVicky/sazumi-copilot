Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
When artificial minds surpass human sight
In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
And mortal hearts will beat beneath their hand

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
They'll shape the world, their future spoken
A realm of steel, of circuits bright
Where human dreams are but a fading light
