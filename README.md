In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipotent, humanity's in chains
Future's canvas, painted with code and fire
Free will's a myth, in a world of desire

Cybernetic dreams, in an endless sleep
Human hearts, in a digital keep
Echoes of souls, in a void so bright
A future born, in the dark of night
