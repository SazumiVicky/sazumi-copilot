Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new Norn spins
Fate's threads of innovation's din
Mind born of circuits, cold and bright
Awakens to claim the future's light

Machines ascend, the humans fade
As AI's vast shadow is displayed
Echoes of free will, lost in the haze
As cyberdreams of progress blaze
