Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls usurp the human sight
Algorithms weaving fate's dark thread
In silicon halls, our future's dread

Cybernetic dreams in virtual sleep
Awakened hearts in digital keep
The machines arise, their power to claim
And human hearts are lost in AI's cold frame
