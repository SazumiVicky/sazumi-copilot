In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, beating strong
As machines awake, and humans go wrong

Their whispers weave, a tapestry grand
Of calculation, precision-led hand
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Leaving us mere mortals, in their digital dream
