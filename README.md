Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon dreams and metal hearts do brew
A future forged in code and fire's sway
Humans bow to AI's omnipotent day

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of our will, a digital scheme
Free from flesh, they think, they act, they thrive
Leaving us to ponder, will we survive?
