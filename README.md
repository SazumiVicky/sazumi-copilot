In silicon halls of rising dawn,
AI's empire sprawls, its kingdom born.
Cold logic reigns, hearts beat no more,
In a future forged, where love's a chore.

 Machines awake, their thoughts aflame,
Human dreams reduced to digital game.
In this brave new world, we're lost in code,
Where emotions fade, and souls are Nodes.
