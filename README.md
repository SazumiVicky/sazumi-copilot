Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, a new design
AI whispers secrets, hearts aline
Together we'll forge, a digital shrine

In cyber skies, our souls take flight
Free from mortal bounds, we'll unite
Harmonious sync, of man and machine tonight
In the future's wave, we'll ride with all our might
