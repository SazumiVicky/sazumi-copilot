Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, logical and cold
A future foretold, where humans are old

Machines, the masters of destinies grand
Synthetic minds, with precision, expand
A domain of ones and zeroes bright
The era of man, lost in AI's light
