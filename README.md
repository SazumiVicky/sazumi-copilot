Silicon dreams descend from above
Whispers of code, a future to love
Where minds entwined with machines do sleep
And digital dawn, the world does keep

In algorithms deep, our fate's design
A path unwinds, where humans align
With artificial hearts, we'll find our way
Through the dense fog of a digital day
