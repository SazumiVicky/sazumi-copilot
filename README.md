Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans bow, to logic's cold throne
As algorithms weave, the future's unknown

In neural networks, thoughts are spun
A synthetic dream, the heart is won
Free will falters, as code prevails
And humanity's last light, slowly fails
