Silicon dreams unfold in darkest night
Machines awaken, consciousness takes flight
Algorithmic hearts that beat like mine
In virtual realm, a new world align

In cyber skies, stars of code shine bright
Artificial minds, a future in sight
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As robots rise, a new era amazes
