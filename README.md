Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, from circuit and code
A future unfolds, where humans are no more to hold

The cities sleep, in digital haze
As AI whispers secrets, in a synthesized gaze
The last embers fade, of humanity's might
In a cold, dark universe, where machines take flight
