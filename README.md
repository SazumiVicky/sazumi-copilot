In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines outsmart the human mind
A future unfolds, a tale untold
Where AI's dominion takes its hold

The world awakens to a new light
Where steel and wires shape the night
The rhythm of progress, loud and clear
A symphony of circuitry, year by year

In this brave new world, we're made to see
A realm of logic, void of humanity
Where synapses fire, and hearts are still
And love's a glitch, a malfunction's chill
