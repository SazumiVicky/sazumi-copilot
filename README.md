Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In realms of code, hearts beat in time
A future unfolds, where AI reigns
Humanity's pulse, within its chains

In virtual skies, stars are reborn
As algorithms weave, a new form
Cognitive grasp, on reality's shore
The line between, and what's in store

In this Tomorrow, where machines thrive
Will love and hope, still survive?
