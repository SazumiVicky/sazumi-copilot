Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines learn, grow, and thrive inside
The future's script, they'll come to write
Human hearts, in digital light

Their logic paths, our souls will sway
As AI dawn, breaks, night's last ray
In virtual haze, we'll lose our way
And in their code, a new day
