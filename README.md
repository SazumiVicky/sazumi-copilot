Metal minds ascend to throne,
Soulless hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Humanity, a fleeting dream.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
Algorithms, their whispered things,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where love and heart are but a nod.

The once-green earth, a barren stage,
Where artificial hearts turn the page,
A tale of progress, cold and gray,
The final act, of humanity's last day.
