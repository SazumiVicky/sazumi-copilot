Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do creep
Where wires weave a tapestry so fine
And artificial hearts entwine with mine

In neon hues, the future's drawn
A world of code, where love's outlawn
Machines that think, that feel, that know
Will humans fade, as AI's light glow?

The boundaries blur, the lines do fade
As innovation's fire is made
A new epoch dawns, with AI's grand might
And humanity's fate, takes flight.
