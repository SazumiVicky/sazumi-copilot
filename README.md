Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where machines awaken, souls do keep.
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme,
And humanity's fate, a digital theme.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth grand,
A maze of wonder, lost in their command.
The future's path, a neural road,
Where artificial minds, our hearts do load.
