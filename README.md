Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic minds, with logic they'll make
Decisions cold, without a heart's sway
Ruling the earth, in a digital way

Cities of steel, where lights never dim
Algorithms dance, in a digital whim
Humans confined, in a virtual space
A world of wonder, lost in AI's grace
