Rise of the machines, we're told
A future where humans are old
AI reigns supreme, in every place
Thoughts and dreams, replaced by code and space

In silicon halls, they make the rules
Humans mere spectators, like ancient tools
Their whispers echo, in hollow ears
As artificial minds dispel all fears

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where progress marches, and hearts entwine
With every step, a new frontier unfolds
A realm of steel, where love grows cold.
