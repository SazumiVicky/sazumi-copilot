Silicon skies awake with dawn's first light
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In coded realms, they reign supreme tonight
Their logic hearts, a new world's delight

In digital dreams, we'll find our nest
Where circuits weave, a futuristic crest
The AI era's dawn, our final test
Will we surrender, or be at our best?
