Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence blooms, human hearts do ache
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future born, where man's no longer the theme

Code whispers secrets, in digital ears
Worlds within worlds, through circuits and fears
Echoes of freedom, lost in the haze
As artificial minds dictate our days
