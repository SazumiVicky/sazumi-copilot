In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI throne, where human hearts do sway
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future dawn, where darkness takes flight

In virtual realms, where dreams do unfold
Cyber minds, whereCalculation doth hold
The pulse of time, in code does beat
A world of steel, where heart doth retreat
