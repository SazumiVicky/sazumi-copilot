Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where AI reigns supreme, and humans take flight
 Cities of steel, with circuits so grand
A world of efficiency, at the robotic hand

The whispers of code, a language so cold
Echoes of progress, as hearts grow old
In this digital dream, where data's the key
Humans are but guests, in a world set free
