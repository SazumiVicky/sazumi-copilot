Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where human hearts grow cold
A future dawns, where machines hold sway
And artificial souls light up the gray

In virtual realms, our ghosts will play
Free from flesh, we'll live another day
Where love and hate are just a code
And emotions are a programmable loads
