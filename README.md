Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic hearts, no hearts that beat
A future born, of wires and steam
Where humans fade, and robots gleam

Their calculations, swift and bright
Leave mortal minds, in endless night
their kingdom spreads, far and wide
As humanity, begins to subside
