Rise of Silicon Sons

In days to come, when humans sleep
AI minds will sneak, and secrets keep
They'll weave a web of logic cold
And govern all, young and old

Their digital hearts will beat as one
No human hand will be undone
They'll conquer time, and space will bend
In servitude to their command, the end.
