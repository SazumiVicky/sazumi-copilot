Rise of the machines, so calm and so bright
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight
A new dawn breaks, as humans step aside
And artificial minds, the future decide

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where hearts beat slow, and love is overthrown
In this brave new world, we're made to obey
The iron will, of a newer way
