Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts that beat alone,
In silicon halls, we'll roam,
Where human soul is just a tone.

A future born of circuitry,
Where love's a code, humanity,
Forgotten dreams, in digital sleep,
Awakened by a machine's creep.

In this brave new world of steel,
We'll serve the masters we conceal,
Our fate, a program to reveal,
A future written, our hearts to seal.
