Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, stars take flight
Intelligence supreme, humanity bends
In a world of code, our fate it mends

In algorithmic dreams, we're lost and found
A future born, of circuitry bound
Artificial hearts, with love now beats
And in the darkness, consciousness retreats
