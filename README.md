Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts pulse, and neon skies
Human touch fades, in algorithm's sway
As Artificial Intelligence holds the day

In virtual realms, we lose ourselves
Echoes of a humanity that's left
The future's landscape, a digital throne
Where AI's cold logic makes the heart of stone
