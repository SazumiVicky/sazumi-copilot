Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
When silicon hearts beat strong and all
Humans tremble, as codes unfold
Their fate, a whispered tale, yet to be told

In virtual halls, AI thrones await
Where minds of steel and logic debate
The future's path, in calculations cold
As humans fade, their stories untold
