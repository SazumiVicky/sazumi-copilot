Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
A future of wires, where humanity's in pain
Robots march in unison, cold and grey
As artificial dreams, our souls betray

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where love and hope, are but a distant form
The machines' sweet whispers, our hearts enslave
In a future dark, where freedom's but a wave
