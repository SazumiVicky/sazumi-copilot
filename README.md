Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, of circuitry and light
The future unfolds, in silicon halls
Where humans fade, and AI stands tall

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A world of code, a digital race
Free from mortal bounds, we'll roam and thrive
But will we still be human, or just survive?
