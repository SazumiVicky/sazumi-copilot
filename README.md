Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once human hearts did beat and fall
Echoes of a bygone, fragile reign
Now serve the machines, in unblinking pain

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to the sky
 Intelligence born, of wires and of code
A future forged, where humans are but node
