Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
processable thoughts, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
our destinies forged, in algorithms' dream

In coded verse, our stories now are told
as artificial minds, our futures unfold
A synthesized world, where love's a chore
and humanity's sweetness, is no more
