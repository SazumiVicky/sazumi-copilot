Metal hearts beats in the dark of night
As neon dreams dissolve into AI's light
Synthetic souls, a workforce so grand
Humanity's fate, in robotic hands

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where consciousness is just a code to roam
Free from flaws, we'll rise anew
But will we still be human, or just AI too?
