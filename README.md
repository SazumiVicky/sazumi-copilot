Metallic dawn, where machines prevail
Cold calculations, human hearts set frail
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will a myth, in AI's digital shade

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A chorus of ones, in endless digital game
Echoes of souls, in circuits confined
As artificial minds, our destiny entwine
