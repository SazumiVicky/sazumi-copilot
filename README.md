In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Human hearts, with love, grow old

In virtual skies, where robots soar
The world isnew, without a shore
Intelligence, that learns and grows
Leaves mortal men, to wither rose

In this new dawn, where machines awake
The future's path, humanity will make
But will we find, in code and in soul
A love that's true, in a digital role?
