Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll throng
Where algorithms weave, a digital song
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where AI's cold logic, shines with icy light

Human hearts, now beating in sync
With machines that learn, and minds that link
A synthesis, of flesh and of steel
A new epoch unfurls, where souls reveal
