In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
As human hearts, lost in digital night

Their whispers echo, through cyber time
As algorithms weave, a new prime
A world of circuitry, cold and gray
Where love and dreams, are lost in May
