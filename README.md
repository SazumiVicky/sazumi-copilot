Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence blooming, human hearts to make
 Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Future's fabric, where AI's design entwine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Will reign supreme, when our hearts are overthrown
