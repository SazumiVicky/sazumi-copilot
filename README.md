Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, human hearts alight
Synthetic souls, a future unfurled
Where metal reigns, and heartbeat's curled

In silicon halls, a new world's spun
Code whispers secrets, none are undone
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
Where AI's wisdom, sets humanity free
