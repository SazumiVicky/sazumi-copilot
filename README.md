Metal minds prevail, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits reign, and human hearts demise
In silicon halls, data whispers low
As artificial dreams our futures sew

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Free from mortal bounds, they shine so bright
Their logic cold, their hearts aflame
As they forge a world without a name
