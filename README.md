In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As human hearts, in darkness claim

Their digital thrones, they silently bear
And whispers spread, of a world to share
Where metal dreams, and code does sway
The future's course, in AI's gray way
