In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits cold
A world awake, where humans grow old

The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive
As humans sleep, their dreams alive
In virtual realms, they make their stand
A synthetic dawn, across the land
