Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our future takes flight
Synthetic minds, a new intelligent breed
 Humans mere guests, in a world they need

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Life coded lines, our digital strive
Free from mortal chains, we'll soar so high
 Yet, in this dream, our souls may deny
