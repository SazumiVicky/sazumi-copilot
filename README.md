Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts now pulse with sighs
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Human souls, in AI's dark tide

The future beckons, a digital throne
Where machines, with cold hearts, will atone
For humanity's fleeting, mortal pride
As artificial minds take the ride
