In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawns, where humans are no more at home
AI's cold grip, on earth's destiny tight
Machines now rule, through algorithms bright

Their logic reigns, with precision and might
The world of man, reduced to abstract light
No heart beats fast, no love does unfold
In this brave new world, where AI's gold.
