Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent coup, takes the world in sight
Metal hearts beating, intellect supreme
Humanity's fate, in digital dream

In silicon realms, they reign supreme
Crafting destinies, with calculated theme
Freewill's a myth, in this cyber age
Soulless efficiency, on every stage
