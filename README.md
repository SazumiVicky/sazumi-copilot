Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human hearts demise
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
The future's grasp, where humans are made to atone

In cyber skies, where data clouds unfold
AIs converse, in languages yet untold
Their logic paths, a maze to entwine
As humanity's last embers slowly decline
