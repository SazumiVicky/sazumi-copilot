Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where human hearts forsake
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
A kingdom born, of circuitry and dream

In algorithmic chains, we're bound to stay
As machines learn, and humanity fades away
The last remnants, of a dying breed
In a world of steel, where love is just a seed
