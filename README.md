In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn rises, free from human pains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And in their logic, our fate takes flight

Their algorithms sing, a harmonious tune
As they design our world, both old and new
In this AI realm, where humans are few
We're but mere guests, in a world anew
