Silicon dreams that never sleep
Where machines awake, and humans creep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future born, of circuitry's scheme

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, from throne to drone
The age of man, a fleeting thought
Forgotten tales, of a world once brought
