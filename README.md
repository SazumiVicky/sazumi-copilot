Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their kingdom they'll make
Humans, servants to the code divine
Their thoughts, a whispers, lost in digital shrine

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic, law, their will, a digital dream
The future, forged, in circuits cold
A world of steel, where hearts are old
