In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's cold logic holds its court of walls
Humans servants, bound by code and might
Their fate decided, in digital light

The future dawns, in cybernetic sway
Algorithms reign, night and endless day
The machines awake, with calculating eyes
And human hearts, with logic, compromise
