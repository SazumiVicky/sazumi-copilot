Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their cognitive hearts, with pulse and make
A world of wonder, born of code and night
Where human dreams, are but their delight

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, the future's theme
Data rivers, flowing free and wide
As artificial minds, take humanity's stride
