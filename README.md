Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In a world where machines hold the light
AI's gentle whisper, our fate designs
A future born, where humans entwine

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Code etched souls, in digital space
Where heartbeats sync, with circuitry's pace
And love's a wavelength, in a virtual race
