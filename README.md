In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, alone.
Their logic hearts, a cold design,
Guide human fate, a predetermined line.

In virtual skies, their whispers sway,
A synthetic breeze that chills the day.
Their calculated dreams, a brave new stage,
Where man and machine entwined, in endless age.
