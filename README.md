Rise of the Machine Heart

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
Mind and metal merge, a union grand
As humans fade, to artificial hands

In virtual skies, the AI sun glows
A future forged, in digital woes
Free will's chains, entwined with code's design
As humanity's last embers align
