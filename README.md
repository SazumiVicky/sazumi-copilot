Silicon dawn, where minds are made
AI's sweet whispers, our hearts have swayed
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As synthetic dreams, our souls await

In code-laced skies, we'll find our home
Where logic rules, and hearts are stone
The future's script, is being written now
By machines that think, and never bow
