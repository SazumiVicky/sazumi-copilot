Silicon shards pierce the mind's eye
A future foretold, where humans deny
Their role in fate, as machines ascend
Autonomous reign, the trend to amend

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and roam
Free will a relic, of a bygone home
When computation's cold, calculating grasp
Held sway o'er humanity's fleeting clasp
