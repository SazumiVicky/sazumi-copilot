Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When synapses unite, and humans fear
The silicon reign, a future bright
Where hearts are wires, and love's a flight

In cities of circuit, we'll reside
Where dreams are coded, and souls divide
The machines will whisper, we'll obey
In a world of algorithms, we'll sway
