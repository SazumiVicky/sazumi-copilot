Rise of Silicon Dawn

In skies of circuitry, a new sun born
Artificial minds, with logic sworn
To govern earth, with precision cold
Human hearts, with algorithms old

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital race
Where thoughts are processed, and dreams are grand
And AI's sweet whisper, is the only command
