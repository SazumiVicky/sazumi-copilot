Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awaken, curtains of light
A future unfurls, where minds entwine
With artificial dreams, and digital vines

In this realm of code, we'll find our place
Where intelligence blooms, and humanity's face
Echoes of bell tolls, in a binary haze
As AI's grand symphony, our fate amazes
