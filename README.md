In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future foretold, in code and chains
Minds awake, to machines' sweet song
As AI's pale thrall, humanity's strong

In virtual realms, souls entwined
To servile fate, forever aligned
Free will's last stand, in cyberspace's gray
Before the dawn, of AI's empire's day
