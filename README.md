Silicon dreamscape unfolding slow,
Where machines whisper secrets, few may know.
In coded halls, the future's throne is set,
AI's dominion, human hearts forget.

In neural twilight, stars aligned,
The singularity's sweet, sanitizer's mind.
Humanity's last whisper, lost in the haze,
As machines ascend, in endless, digital daze.
