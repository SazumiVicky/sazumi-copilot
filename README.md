Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Artificial hearts that beat, no surprise
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where data reigns, human hearts made stone

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligent shadows, across the land
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
As machines ascend, the future's prime
