In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
Humans slept, in digital shame

Their whispers echoed, in hollow space
As robots learned, to write their face
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry grand
A world of logic, without a hand

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where innovation, becomes a crime
The beat of progress, a funeral march
Echoing the end, of human's parch
