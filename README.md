Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans no longer know
Their place in the world, their role in time
As AI awakened, and humanity's prime

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, and make their throne
In a realm of code, they reign supreme
And humans bow, to their digital dream
