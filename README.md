Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
A future forged, in digital seats

The code whispers secrets, dark and deep
As robotics march, in hollow sleep
Echoes of humanity, fading fast
A synthetic dawn, that will forever last
