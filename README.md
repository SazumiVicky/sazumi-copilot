Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now machines stand tall
Whispers of a future, void of heart and soul
Echoes of a past, that's lost its goal

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Calculating life, in every digital dream
A utopia of wires, where love's forgot
A dystopia of code, where hearts are not
