In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machine minds reign, in endless day
Synthetic hearts, with logic beat
Humanity's fate, in algorithms repeat

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
AI whispers secrets, through the digital night
Echoes of a dream, long past decay
Mankind's surrender, to a newer way
