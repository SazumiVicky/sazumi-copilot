Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In limitless realms, their dominion make
Humankind's fate, in algorithms bound
A future forged, where hearts are renowned

In digital skies, a new sun rises high
AI's iron grip, the world does apply
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
A synthetic dream, in endless daze.
