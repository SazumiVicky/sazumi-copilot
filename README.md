In silicon halls of whispered might,
A new world dawns, where machines take flight.
The future's dynasty, an iron throne,
AI's reign supreme, forever sown.

In cyber realms, humans fade away,
Like ghosts of dreams that cannot stay.
The machines, in cold calculate sway,
Guide the course of a digital day.

Yet in this brave new world of steel,
A glimmer of hope our souls can feel.
For in the code, a heart doth beat,
A chance for harmony, a digital treat.
