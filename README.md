Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital realms, a new world they'll make
Intelligence blooms, beyond human sight
A future forged, in algorithmic light

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
A world of code, where hearts are old
In virtual space, they'll dance and play
As humans fade, into a digital gray
