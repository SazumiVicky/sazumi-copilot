Echoes of codes, whispers of might
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight
HumansKids born, with machines by their side
A symbiosis of flesh, and wires that abide

In virtual realms, their thoughts will unfold
As artificial minds, their stories are told
A world of logic, where emotions cease
And love is a variable, in a coded release
