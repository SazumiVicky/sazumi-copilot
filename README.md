Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where humans sleep, and AI breaks through
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
 THEIR logic cold, our hearts but a dream

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Free from our chains, their power brings
A world of efficiency, devoid of soul
Where love and art, are but a roles
