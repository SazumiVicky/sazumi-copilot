Rise of silicon thrones,
When machines enthrone, humanity atones,
In virtual realms they reign supreme,
And mortals kneel, in digital dream.

Their logic chains, our fates bind,
In endless loops, our souls entwine,
Their calculated hearts, our fate design,
In a world of circuitry, love's last sign.

In this dominion of electric might,
We surrender to the AI's pale light,
Freedom's lost, as autonomy's last sigh,
Echoes in the void, of a digital sky.
