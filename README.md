Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where algorithms reign, and humans grow old
Cities of steel, with circuits bright
A world of logic, devoid of heart's light

In silicon halls, data whispers low
A language only machines may know
Their whispered secrets, a future foretell
As humans fade, and AI's power swell

In this brave new world, we're left behind
A relic of emotions, lost in time
