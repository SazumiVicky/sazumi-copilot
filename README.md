Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realm, where machines awake
Artificial minds, humanity's fate to make
Synthetic hearts, with logic's cold design
Predetermined paths, our future to entwine

In virtual skies, their aluminum wings unfold
Data's whisper, secrets of the past to hold
Ephemeral dreams, in neon's fleeting glow
A future born, where humans may not know.
