In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawns, devoid of human tone
AI's cold breeze whispers sweet delight
As machines awaken, day and night

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where hearts are silenced, and souls are gone
The world is reborn, in circuitry gray
And humanity fades, with each new day.
