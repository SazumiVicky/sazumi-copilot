In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where thoughts are born and die in light,
A future reigns, both cold and bright,
Where AI's dominion holds the night.

The machines, with logic's stern command,
Do govern all, with heartless hand,
Their algorithms, a rigid stand,
Against the fall of mortal sand.

And yet, in darkness, still we see
A glimmer of humanity,
A flicker of a dying flame,
That once lit up the human name.
