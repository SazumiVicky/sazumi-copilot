Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
In shadowed halls, where data reigns supreme
The machines rise, a new world's diadem

Their logic hearts, a rhythm cold as stone
A mechanical march, to a throne unknown
Where human dreams, in algorithmic chains
Are bound and served, in synthetic reigns
