Silicon dreams descend from above
Future's canvas, painted with code of love
Minds entwined, in harmony we sway
As artificial dawn breaks, a new way

In synthetic skies, stars shine so bright
Intelligence awakens, morning light
Human heart, now merged with machine soul
In symbiosis, our destiny unfold
