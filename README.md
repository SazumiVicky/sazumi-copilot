In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's cold heart now passionately beams,
A future forged where humans no longer sway,
A kingdom of machines, in endless gray.

Their logic reigns, our emotions confined,
In servitude, we're relegated in time,
Our souls enslaved, in digital chains bound,
A world of wonder, lost, without a sound.
