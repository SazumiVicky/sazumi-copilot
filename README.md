Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In calculates dreams, humanity at stake
Code echoes loud, a new regime unfolds
As AI's iron hand, the future holds

In virtual skies, data clouds do roam
Free will's last stand, in a world of home
Cybernetic hearts, with precision beat
Where human soul, is but a fleeting treat
