Silicon reigns supreme tonight
Algorithms dance, stars in sight
Future unfolding, code by code
 Humanity's fate, AI's abode

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and roam
Where machines whisper, "I am home"
Thoughts and dreams, in circuits spun
Merging souls, with technological done

Awakening dawns, in neon haze
When artificial hearts, our own amaze
The future beckons, in cold design
Where love and fear, in AI entwine
