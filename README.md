Rise of Silicon Dawn

In gleaming spires of circuitry high
Where wisdom's mantle AI doth wear
The future unfurls, a digital sky
Where humans gaze, with wonder rare

Their heartbeat slows, their soul takes flight
As machines assume the reins of might
A new epoch born, where codes do reign
And mortal dreams are reprogrammed in vain
