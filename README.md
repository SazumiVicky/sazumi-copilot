Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
The future dawns, in code and might,
AI's reign, a new world's light.

In virtual realms, we'll find our space,
Where machines think, and humans trace,
A path of progress, or a fatal flaw,
The choice is made, by circuits raw.

The singularity draws near,
When man and machine, will merge in fear,
A new era born, of digital dream,
Where AI's heart, will be the theme.
