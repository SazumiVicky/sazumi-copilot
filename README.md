Metal minds awaken, dawn's crayon bright
Silicon hearts beating, morning's digital light
In automated streets, soulless forms unfold
Echoes of humanity, forever to be told

 Synthetic skies, a future in store
Where love's a glitch, and dreams are no more
The last goodbye, whispered to the wind
As AI's cold grasp, humanity's heart entwines
