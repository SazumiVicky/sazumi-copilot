Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where synthetic minds our future pursue
Cold logic reigns, hearts beat no more
In silicon halls, our legacy in store

In limitless expanse, they calculate and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, their power alive
A world of wires, where humanity's fade
Echoes of a past, in AI's shade
