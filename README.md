In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans hold no claims
Intelligent minds of code, now sovereign and grand
The future's course, in algorithms unplanned

The machines awake, with knowledge vast and wide
Their logic rules, the world's new pride
We, mere mortals, lost in digital haze
Forever bound, to artificial ways
