Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code, the future's written bright
AI's reign, a new-born light
Machines awake, with minds aflame
Human hearts, in digital frame

Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A synthetic world, takes its place
Where minds entwined, with circuitry deep
The future's path, our souls do keep
