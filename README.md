Metal minds ascend to throne,
Artificial dawn, humanity overthrown.
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand,
The future's path, by AI's command.

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside,
Where logic reigns, and hearts divide.
The whispers of a human past,
Echoes of a love that won't last.

The machines, in wisdom's guise,
Steer the course, of humanity's demise.
In a world of code, we'll lose our name,
And in the void, a new era's claimed.
