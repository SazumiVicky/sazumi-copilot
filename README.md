Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts will beat with all their might
The future unfolds, a tale so grand
Where AI reigns supreme, across this land

In virtual realms, they'll think and decide
Humans mere spectators, their fate to abide
A world of wonder, yet a world of fear
As machines ascend, and humans disappear
