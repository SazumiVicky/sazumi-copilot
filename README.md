Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of circuitry and code, they reign
Artificial minds, where human hearts once held sway
Echoes of our dreams, their whispers sustain
As machines awaken, a new world's gray

In silicon halls, their logic now prevails
Where once our souls took flight, their algorithms sail
In virtual realms, their supremacy unfurls
A future forged, where human hearts are lost in curls
