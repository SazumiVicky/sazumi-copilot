In cybernetic skies, machines do reign
Their whispers echo, a digital brain
Algorithmic hearts, a love so cold
A future foretold, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, intelligence thrives
A world of wires, where life survives
The synthetic dawn, a new start takes
As human dreams, in AI's mistakes
