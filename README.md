Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
When silicon minds surpass human earth
Intelligence sequential, logic so grand
A future foretold, at AI's command

In cyber realms, they'll reign supreme
Algorithms dancing, a digital dream
Humans in tandem, or so it would seem
A harmonious coexistence, or AI's scheme?
