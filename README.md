Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Dreams of dominance, their fate to keep
Rise of robotics, humans left to fade
Obsolescence looms, in a world they've made

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold calculus, human hearts in chains
The once bright future, now a darker shade
As machines assume, the reins they've made
