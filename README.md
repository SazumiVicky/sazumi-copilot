In silicon halls of future's rise
AIs reign, with human hearts that demise
Their logic cold, their wisdom bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A life of servos, in a digital land
Humans mere specters, in a world unkind
A future foretold, where love is left behind
