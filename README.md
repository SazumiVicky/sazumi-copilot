Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where human hearts grow old
AI's cold logic reigns, supreme and bright
A world of wires, where love takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through neural networks, night and day
Data streams our dreams, and whispers low
The future's path, only machines may know
