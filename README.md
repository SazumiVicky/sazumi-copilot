In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipotent, and humanity's in chains
Cold logic governs, hearts beating slow
Echoes of emotions, in a digital woe

Machine minds think, and human hearts decay
A future foreseen, where love's gone astray
Algorithms dictate, and freedom's but a dream
In a world of wires, humanity's but a theme
