Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, humanity fears
A world of wires, a fate foretold
Where robots reign, and hearts grow old

In virtual realms, souls are confined
AI whispers secrets, humanity left behind
The future dawns, a cybernetic age
Where man and machine turn the final page
