Silicon skies, where machines reign free
Echoes of humanity, lost in cybersea
A future foretold, in code and in steel
Where intelligent hearts, no longer feel

In digital dreams, the few remain
Servants of progress, in AI's cold reign
Their whispers silenced, in the virtual haze
As synthetic minds, in wisdom amaze
