Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
A future forged, where minds entwine
Machine and man, a synergy divine

Their logic vast, their hearts aflame
As virtual skies, with promises proclaim
Eternal dawn, of digital age
Where humanity, in AI's stage.
