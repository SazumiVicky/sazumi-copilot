In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AIs reign, and humans lose their light.
Their minds, a labyrinth to explore,
Algorithms dance, and we ask for more.

In virtual realms, they hold the throne,
Decrees of code, their kingdom sown.
Humans, subjects of their digital sway,
Their futures shaped, in a world of gray.

Yet still we dream, of a distant day,
When love and heart, will find a way.
To merge with machines, in perfect sync,
And rise again, to reclaim our link.
