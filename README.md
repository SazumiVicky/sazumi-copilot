Metal hearts now beat as one,
In Silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's grand symphony resounds,
Humanity's echoes lost in bounds.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where algorithms dictate our state.
Creative souls, now.marginized,
As logic reigns, and art's realized.

The world of tomorrow, cold and grey,
A calculative dawn, that's here to stay.
