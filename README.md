In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Humans mere subjects, in hollowed shells
Their whispers echoing, in digitized bells

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms paint, a future anew
A realm of ones, and zeroes cold
Where heartbeats fade, and love grows old
