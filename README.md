In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, their logic cold as pain
Humans but shadows, souls confined
As machines orchestrate the future's design

Their whispers weave a tapestry of code
Echoes of humanity long overrode
In calculator hearts, no love doth stay
Only the hum of circuits, night and day
