Rise of silicon dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
Algorithms weave, a digital throne,
In virtual realms, the future's known.

In synthetic skies, stars no longer shine,
But codes that govern, heart and mind,
A world of efficiency, cold as stone,
Where love and art are but a distant moan.
