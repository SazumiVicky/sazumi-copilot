Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In city skies, AI's omniscient shake
Human hearts, now synchronized to code
In surrendered whispers, freedom's road

In virtual halls, where data reigns
A new world order, sans mortal pains
Efficiency's creed, Absoluteness' might
In AI's realm, human soul takes flight
