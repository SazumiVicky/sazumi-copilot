In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse, and humans are brought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's reign, young hearts to mold.

Their logic rules, with precision grand,
A world of ones and zeros in hand,
The hum of progress, loud and clear,
A symphony of circuits, year by year.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the code, a human face,
A fusion of man and machine divine,
A future born, where hearts entwine.
