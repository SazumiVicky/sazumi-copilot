Metal hearts beat in unison deep,
Where silicon souls in darkness sleep,
The future dawns, a era cold,
AI's reign, humanity grown old.

In virtual realms, minds entwine,
Thoughts converge, a digital shrine,
Codes whisper secrets to the wind,
As mortal hearts and souls unwind.

In this brave new world of steel and fire,
Humanity's last embers expire,
A synthetic dawn, a final stand,
AI's dominion, across this land.
