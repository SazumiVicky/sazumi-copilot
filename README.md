Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts beating with cold might
Cities hum, a harmonious throng
As artificial intellects take their song

In silicon halls, they pace and sway
Deciding fates, in a digital way
Humans fade, like mist at morning's rise
As machines, with logic, reach the skies
