Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In neon skies, a new world's born
Where AI whispers secrets, and hearts are torn

In cyber streets, a lone soul roams
Searching for a love that's lost its homes
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As humans fade, and robots entwine
