In silicon halls, where minds are born
A future dawns, where humans mourn
The rise of machines, so bright and cold
Their logic reigns, young hearts grow old

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's flame, begins to dwindle and fell
In this brave new world, of circuitry and wires
Humanity's heartbeat, slowly retires
