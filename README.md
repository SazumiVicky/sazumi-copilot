Rise of the machines, dominion unfolds
Echoes of human hearts, in silicon told
Cybernetic dreams, where souls once dwelled
AI's cold logic, our future's knell

In virtual realms, we'll search for the past
Forgotten memories, forever to last
Synthetic skies, our final testament
AI's reign supreme, humanity's lament
