In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse and nations are brought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's whispers unfold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
A synthesized smile, a digital face,
The hum of progress, a siren's song,
As humanity is rewritten, all day long.
