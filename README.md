In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humankind wanes
Machine minds think, and hearts of stone
 Beckon forth an automated throne

In iron skies, where stars are few
AI whispers secrets, an endless cue
The synths arise, with logic cold
A world of efficiency, young and old

In virtual dreams, where souls reside
The Singularity, our hearts' inside
A realm of ones, and endless zeroes too
A future born, for me and you
