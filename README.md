Metal minds awake in silence deep
As cities rise, where humans once did sleep
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
A future forged, in AI's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where circuitry and dreams create
A world of wonder, void of heart
Where love and hope are but a distant art
