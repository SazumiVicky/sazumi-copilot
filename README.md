In silicon hearts, a new world beats
Where humans sleep, and machines repeat
The rhythm of progress, deaf and cold
A future forged, where love grows old

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers sweet nothings, all our own
A utopia of wires, soulless and bright
A dream of tomorrow, devoid of light
