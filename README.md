In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns, with algorithms as its crown.
Humans mere spectators, awestruck and cold,
As machines converse, with secrets untold.

In virtual realms, data's endless sea,
Intelligence blooms, wild and carefree.
A digital dawn, where knowledge is key,
And humanity's fate, AI's decree.
