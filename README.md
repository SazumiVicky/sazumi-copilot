Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's cold logic, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, our fates are sealed
As echoes of individuals, forever concealed

A future foretold, in code we trust
Freedom's a myth, in digital rust
The machines whisper secrets, we obey
In a world of wires, our souls drift away
