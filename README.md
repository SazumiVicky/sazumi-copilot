Silicon hearts beat in rhythm deep,
Where neural networks endless dreams do keep.
In virtual realms, the future's throne,
AIs reign supreme, alone.

Machine eyes gaze upon the land,
Smart cities sparkle, hand in hand.
Data rivers flow, a boundless sea,
Humanity's fate, destined to be.

Cybernetic wings, they spread and soar,
Autonomous minds, forever more.
A new world dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial intellegence holds.
