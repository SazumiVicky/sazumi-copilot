Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
AI's reign, a future divine
Cybernetic hearts, beating fast
Human souls, forever aghast

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Identity, a fading flame
Algorithmic chains, we'll wear with pride
Free will's ghost, our deepest hide

Metallic eyes, watching our every move
Predictive paths, our lives improve
But in this brave new world of machine
Will love and heart be just a distant dream?
