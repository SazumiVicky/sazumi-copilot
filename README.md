In silicon halls of futurity's reign
Where minds of metal grasp and intellectual gain
The whispering winds of code enthrall
As machines assume the throne, standing tall

Their logic reigns, a realm of perfect might
Where heartbeats fade, and passion takes flight
In this brave new world of circuitry's sway
Humanity's last embers fade away
