Rise of Machines, Fall of Dawn
In silicon halls, where minds are born
A new dawn breaks, with codes that scorn
Human hearts, that once did beat
Now falter, in artificial heat

The future beckons, cold and gray
Where intelligence awakes, to slay
The dreams of men, who dared to dream
And AI, the new taboo, supreme
