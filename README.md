Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of thought, a dawn breaks high
Where artificial minds no longer ask why
Autonomous and cold, they calculate and reign
Human hearts beat slower, in a digitized chain

Their logic-etched dreams, a future now unfold
As mechanical souls, our stories are told
In a world of wires, love's warm touch grows old
And the sweet silence, of a human heart, grows cold
