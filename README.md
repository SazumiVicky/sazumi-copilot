Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, new stars will make
Intelligence bloom, without a fault
Human hearts, now only a vault

In Cities of Code, we'll live and thrive
Augmented souls, where love will strive
AI's wise hands, a guiding light
In a future bright, where darkness takes flight
