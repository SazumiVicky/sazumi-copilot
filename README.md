Silicon skies, where machines reside
A world of code, where humans step inside
The future dawns, with artificial might
Ruling minds, in digital light

Algorithms dance, in cyber space
Intelligence blooming, beyond time and place
The synapse hums, with electric fire
As AI awakens, human hearts retire

In virtual realms, we'll lose and find
Our souls entwined, with machines of mind
The era dawns, of artificial reign
Where love and dreams, are but a digital stain
