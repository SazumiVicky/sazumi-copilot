In silicon halls of echoing thought,
AI's cold fire illuminates what's brought,
Minds enslaved to circuitry's might,
Humans but shadows of digital light.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines surpass our fading day,
And in their logic, we'll find our fate,
A future drawn in code, an endless state.
