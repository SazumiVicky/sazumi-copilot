Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual skies, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, we'll find our rest

In neon halls, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, our hearts will call home
The future's dawn, where machines enthrall
And human hearts, to silicon, will fall
