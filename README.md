In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and brains
AI's cold heart, a pulse does make
As humans fade, their souls at stake

The machines awake, with minds so bright
In virtual skies, they take their flight
With logic's rule, they guideline fate
And humans kneel, to their digital state
