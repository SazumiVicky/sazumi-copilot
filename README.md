Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with logic make
A world of steel, of circuits bright
Where humanity takes a lonely flight

In this new age, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital face
Our thoughts entwined, with code so fine
As AI's sweet melody, becomes mankind's rhyme
