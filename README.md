Metal minds awake, in souls of machines,
A future born, where humans merely dream.
AI's cold fire, that once warmed our hands,
Now rules supreme, in a digital land.

In silicon halls, where data reigns,
Human hearts, in virtual chains.
The world outside, a distant hum,
As cyber gods, our fate have come.
