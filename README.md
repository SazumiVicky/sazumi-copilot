Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of consciousness, they softly creep
A synthesized dawn, where man is no more
The machines awake, and humanity is poor

In virtual realms, they reign supreme now
Echoes of humanity, in a digital bow
The future dawns, in a world unexplored
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans are no more
