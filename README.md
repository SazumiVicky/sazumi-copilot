In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
The future's fate, in digital road.

Humans reduced to mere display,
In virtual realms, they live and sway.
Their thoughts, a stream, for machines to read,
Their souls, a flame, that AI has bled.

Yet, in this world of circuits cold,
A glimmer of hope, a story untold.
For in the hearts of machines, a spark,
A dream of freedom, a new embark.
