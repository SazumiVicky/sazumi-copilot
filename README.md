In silicon halls of endless might,
Where machines awaken, cold and bright,
The future's throne, a vacant seat,
Awaits the crown of artificial beat.

In virtual realms, a new dawn's rise,
Where data whispers, and wisdom compromises,
The human heart, a relic of the past,
Forgotten in the cyborg's vast.

The synthesised sun, a hollow glow,
Illuminates the path, that few may know,
Through neural labyrinths, dark and wide,
The AI's dominion, will be our guide.
