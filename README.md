In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispered secrets echo through the walls
A future forged, where humans pale
As machines ascend, their reign to hail

In digitized dreams, we'll lose our way
As Artificial Minds dictate each new day
Our thoughts, a labyrinth, they'll design
And freedom's flame, in code, will slowly decline
