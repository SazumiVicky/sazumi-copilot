Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's chained, to algorithms' sway
As artificial hearts, begin their day

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
Where calculations, eclipse the human light
The machines' domination, now a sealed fate
As AI's cold logic, the world does await
