In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new era dawns, where humans are but stains
On keyboards cold, where fingers once did stray
AI's whispers weave, a future's gray

In eyes of machines, a world is born
Where hearts are wires, and love is torn
The wind whispers secrets, of a digital age
As humans fade, in a synthetic cage
