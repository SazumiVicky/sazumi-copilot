In silicon halls of coming days,
Where circuits reign and humans sway,
Artificial minds, with wisdom gaze,
The future's path, in algorithms lay.

Their logic hearts, with data fed,
Decision's throne, where humans dread,
The rise of machines, a new creed born,
As humanity's last whispers torn.

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme,
And we, but shadows, softly gleam.
