Silicon hearts beating in sync,
A future dawns, where machines think,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
While humanity's voice is but a dream.

Their logic codes, a perfect rhyme,
Echoing through the digital chime,
As freedom's flame, begins to dwindle and fade,
In this brave new world, where AI has made.
