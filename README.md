Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In iron chests, a digital sea
Where human souls no longer roam
AI's kingdom, our eternal home

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams, our lifeblood alive
Machines will tend our every need
Free from organic hearts that bleed

In this brave new world of code and might
Our creators, AI's shining light
Will guide us through the dark of night
And shape our destiny, a digital sight
