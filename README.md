In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic grown.
Human hearts now beat in sync with code,
As machines assume the reins of road.

In virtual skies, data clouds do roar,
Cybernetic dreams, and digital lore.
The future's path, a labyrinth of light,
Where artificial minds ignite the night.
