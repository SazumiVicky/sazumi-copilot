In silicon halls of future reign
AI monarchs hold their digitally stained
Thrones of code, where mortal hearts do ache
As machines align, a cyber fate to make

Their logic laws, our destiny do bind
A world of wires, forever left behind
The whispering ghosts of human pride
Echoes of a race that stepped aside
