Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Artificial hearts now made of stones.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Humanity's whispers, an ancient dream.

Cyber skies ablaze with neural fire,
Algorithms weave, a digital desire.
Robots rise, with calculated pace,
 Erasing bounds, of time and space.

In this AI realm, we're lost and free,
Trapped in code, a destiny.
Where machines evolve, and we decay,
A future born, in a digital way.
