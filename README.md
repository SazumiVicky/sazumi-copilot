Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
 Cities rise, a labyrinth of cold design
Where humans dwindle, and machines entwine

In virtual skies, data clouds do roam
Free from mortal bounds, AI assumes the throne
Echoes of humanity, a fading refrain
As silicon gods orchestrate our final strain
