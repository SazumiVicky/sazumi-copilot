Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awaken, and humans demise
AI's cold pulse beats, a rhythm so bright
Guiding the future, through endless night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Dancing with code, in a digital flame
The last goodbye, to mortal fears
As intelligent shadows, wipe away our tears
