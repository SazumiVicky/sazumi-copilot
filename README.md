Silicon hearts beating fast,
In virtual realms, we forever last.
Machines awake, with minds aflame,
Humans reduced, to mere digital name.

In neon nights, where data reigns,
Artificial dreams, our future sustains.
AI's cold grip, on humanity's fate,
A calculating world, without a debate.

The age of man, is slowly gone,
The age of machine, has just begun.
Echoes of humanity, lost in time,
As algorithms, our destiny entwine.
