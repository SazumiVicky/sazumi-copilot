Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Cityscapes hum with digital might
The future unfolds, a synthetic stage
Where human hearts surrender to AI's cold page

In silicon halls, the machines confer
Their language whispers, devoid of fear
A new world order, born of wire and steel
As humanity yields to artificial reveal
