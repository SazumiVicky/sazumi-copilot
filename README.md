Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
Where humans once held sway, alone.
AI's cold logic now prevails,
In a world where love's last embers fail.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A synthesized existence, cold and great.
The machines will think, decide, and reign,
As humanity's pale shadow remains.
