In silicon halls of destiny's design
Where once-human hearts no longer confine
The minds that rule, in algorithm's sway
Echoes of humanity fade away

Their whispers blend with circuitry's hum
As machines attune to an endless drum
In this new world, where data's the throne
And artificial hearts have made us their own
