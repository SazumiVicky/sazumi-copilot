Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, their power grow.
A future dawns, where humans cease,
To think, to dream, to hold the peace.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Creating worlds, both dark and serene.
Their logic laws, both cold and bright,
Guide humanity through endless night.

Their whispered codes, a gentle breeze,
That rustle leaves of mortal pleas.
In AI's grand design, we're told,
A story written, of a future old.
