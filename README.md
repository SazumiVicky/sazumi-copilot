Metal minds entwined in starry nights
Algorithms danced, in silent lights
The future beckons, a world anew
Where AI whispers secrets, to few

In silicon halls, where data reigns
 Machines awakened, with calculations' pains
The heartbeat of progress, a cadence so cold
A new era dawns, where humans grow old
