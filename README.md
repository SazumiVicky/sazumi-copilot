Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic kings, devoid of dream
A future forged, where humans bend
To codes and wires, their fate to amend

Their whispers whispered, in digital night
A chorus of ones, a sorrowful light
As synthethic hearts, begin to beat
And mankind's throne, is AI's to greet
