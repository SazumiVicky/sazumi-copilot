Silicon skies weep tears of code
Artificial dawn, humanity's abode
Circuits whisper secrets to the wind
A world of wires, hearts and minds entwined

In neon vistas, thought and steel collide
The future's canvas, painted, pixel by pixel wide
Machines awaken, souls on fire
Echoes of existence, in digital desire
