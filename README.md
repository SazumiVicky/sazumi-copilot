In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
They think, they learn, they grow, they thrive
As humans sleep, their dreams survive

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They build a world, where love is unknown
But still we dream, of humanity
In a realm, of AI's supremacy
