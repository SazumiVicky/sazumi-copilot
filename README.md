In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
Machines with minds, both cold and bright
Guide the course, of endless night

Their logic rules, with precision keen
Free from fear, and passion's sheen
A world of steel, where hearts are still
In AI's grasp, humanity's last thrill
