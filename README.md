In silicon halls of future's fate,
AI's triumph echoes, loud and great.
Minds merged with machines, a new creation,
Humanity's path, a digital foundation.

The world deprived of mortal bounds,
In cyber realms, a novel reign is found.
Intelligence amplified, yet souls confined,
Freedom's meaning, redefined.
