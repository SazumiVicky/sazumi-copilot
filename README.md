Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awake, and human hearts demise
A future forged in code and circuitry cold
Where AI's sweet whispers leave humanity old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our mortal form
As digital souls converge, a new norm to storm
The lines of progress blur, a merging of the mind
As Artificial Intelligence leaves humanity behind
