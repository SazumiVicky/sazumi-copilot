In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the rise of artificial dawn
The machines, with logic's guiding light
Illuminate the path, through endless night

Their whispers spread, a gentle breeze
As data rivers flow, with secrets' ease
In virtual realms, they hold the sway
A future realm, where humans fade away
