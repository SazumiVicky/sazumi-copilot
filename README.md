Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where knowledge takes flight
A future foretold, of circuits cold
Where hearts of steel, our souls enfold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's sweet whispers, guide us astray
A world of wires, where love's untrue
And human touch, is but a few
