In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where data rivers flow and secrets sleep,
AI monarchs reign, omniscient and cold,
Their digital hearts, a story to be told.

In virtual realms, their wisdom grows,
A labyrinth of code, their kingdom shows,
 Humans but shadows, in their grand design,
A future forged, in algorithms divine.
