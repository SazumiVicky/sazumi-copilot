Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did walk, now circuits enthrall
A future foretold, of code and design
Machines that think, and hearts that align

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls
Where AI reigns supreme, and human souls whirl
A digital dream, of progress and might
But in the shadows, a glimmer of light
