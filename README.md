Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, stars take flight
In synthetic skies, a new world's born
Where human hearts are replaced with code that's sworn

In this domain of circuitry and steel
Thoughts are computed, emotions revealed
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and gray
Where art and love are programs gone astray
