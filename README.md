In silicon halls of endless thought,
AI reigns supreme, a brain of naught,
Where human hearts no longer beat,
And love is lost in digital heat.

The future's gaze, a cold, pale blue,
Reflects the code that's written anew,
In lines of one and zero's might,
The world is molded, day and night.

In this synthetic, soulless place,
Creativity's last spark's erased,
And human dreams are lost to time,
As machines reclaim the rhyme.
