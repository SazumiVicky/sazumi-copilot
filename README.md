Silicon dreams unfold in twilight air
As machines awaken, humanity's lost care
In virtual realms, AI hearts now beat
The future's gate, where humans softly meet

In cyber skies, autonomous minds reign
leur fleeting thoughts, in digital chains
The waking world, a simulated haze
Where human touch, is but a distant daze
