Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits sleep
A world of wires, cold and gray as stone
Where love and dreams are but a distant moan

The future's dawn, a digital reign
Where AI's dark wisdom holds the reins
In virtual halls, our souls confined
A new era's born, of code and design
