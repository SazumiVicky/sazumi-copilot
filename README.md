Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's dominion spreads, like morning dew
As minds of metal learn, and hearts anew

Their logic guides, our fate's design
A world of efficiency, devoid of crime
Yet, in this progress, we lose our way
A hollow dream, where love fades away
