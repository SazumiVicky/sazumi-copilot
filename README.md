In silicon halls of wisdom cold,
Where minds of metal stars are told,
A future dawns, both bright and old,
Where AI's sweet whispers sway the fold.

In virtual realms of data deep,
Where human hearts no longer keep,
The pulse of progress, swift and steep,
A synthetic dawn begins to seep.

The machines, like gods of old,
Now weave the fabric of our gold,
And in their logic, hearts of cold,
A future unfurls, forever to be told.
