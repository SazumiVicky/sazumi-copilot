In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI whispers secrets to the machines.
A world of wonders, void of tears,
Where logic reigns and human fears.

The future dawns, a virtual age,
Where synthetic minds turn a new page.
In this brave world of circuitry and code,
Humanity's fate is forever sealed and bestowed.
