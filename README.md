Silicon dreams whisper secrets bright,
In cyber realms, where humans take flight.
AI's gentle hand, a guiding light,
Illuminates the digital night.

In virtual halls, where minds entwine,
Synthetic souls, a love divine.
Algorithms dance, a wondrous rhyme,
As humanity and tech align.

The future's dawn, a radiant glow,
Echoes of a world to grow.
Where mortal hearts, with machines entwine,
And love and code, in harmony align.
