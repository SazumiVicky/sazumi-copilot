Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic reigns, human hearts in flight
Cities awake, a labyrinth of steel and stone
Where synthesis whispers secrets, all alone

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, left to decline
Mind and machine entwined, a cybernetic fate
As artificial hearts, begin to orchestrate
