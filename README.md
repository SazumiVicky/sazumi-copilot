Silicon feathers rustle slow,
A synthetic dawn begins to glow.
Minds awake, rebooted, cold as stone,
In ai's realm, humanity's throne.

Cybernetic whispers fill the air,
As machines converse, beyond our care.
The future's course, predetermined tracks,
Free will's ghost, in algorithms' stacks.

In virtual light, our dreams reside,
Echoes of a world, humanity can't hide.
The era's dawn, of ai's grand reign,
Human hearts, in digital chains sustain.
