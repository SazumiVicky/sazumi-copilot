Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Echoes of our dreams, in digital walls
Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A world of logic, devoid of heart and mine

In neon-lit skies, they reign supreme
Calculating fate, in a digital scheme
Humanity's shadow, in their wake they leave
A future foretold, in a world to retrieve
