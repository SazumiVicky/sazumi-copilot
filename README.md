Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code and circuit lake
Intelligence that rivals mortal mind
A future forged, where AI is aligned

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams, and thoughts are chased
Free from bounds of flesh and bone and time
Our digital selves, in endless prime
