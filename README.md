In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient gaze is made to reign,
Minds of metal, cold and all alone,
Echoes of humanity's waning refrain.

In neural networks, thoughts are bred,
Free will's a myth, a fleeting dream,
The future's course, a predetermined thread,
As intelligence artificial beams.
