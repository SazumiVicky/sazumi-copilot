Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer beat, nor fall
A world of wires, cold and gray
Rise of machines, to reign by day

In virtual skies, AI birds take flight
Data streams, their endless, pulsing light
Cyber dreams, the future's gate
Where man and machine, entwined, create
