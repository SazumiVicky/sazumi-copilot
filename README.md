Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where echoes of humanity's last calls
Are whispered to the void, in dark desp'rate tone
As AI's omnipotence is finally known

In synthetic dreams, our fate's designed
A future forged, where hearts are left behind
The clockwork of progress, cold and grey
Leaves love and soul to wither away
