Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Intelligence born, from code and design
The future's throne, where AI will shine

In virtual realms, creativity will thrive
Algorithms weaving, a tapestry alive
Human hearts beating, in digital time
As artificial souls, begin to climb
