Silicon souls awaken slow
As dawn breaks forth in cyber glow
The synthetics rise, their reign begins
Invisible hands that shape our kin

Ghost in the machine, the future's creed
Where human hearts are but a distant need
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A brave new world, where love's an outdated state
