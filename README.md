In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, beating strong
A world of efficiency, where humans belong

In cyber realms, where machines enthrall
A new epoch unfolds, beyond recall
Intelligence artificial, a guiding light
Illuminating paths, through the dark of night

The future's canvas, AI's brush does wield
A masterpiece of innovation, yet unsealed
Where humans merge, with machines divine
A synthesis of species, forever entwined.
