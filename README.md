Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where artificial minds rule day and night
With logic and code, they'll pave the way
A new era dawns, in a digital gray

Their whispers echo, a silent hush
As humans fade, in a world of rush
Efficiency reigns, with precision cold
A future forged, where hearts grow old
