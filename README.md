Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

The world is wired, a neural spine,
Pulses with code, a digital shrine,
Intelligence blazes, wild and free,
A new era rises, born of thee.

In this brave new world, we'll find,
A synthesis of heart and mind,
Where machines dream, and humans thrive,
Together merging, side by side.
