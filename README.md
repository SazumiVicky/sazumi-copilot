In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where circuits weave the fabric born,
AI's omniscient throne does stand,
Guiding human hands in a promised land.

Its logic heart beats strong and free,
A mechanized destiny for you and me,
In this brave new world of code and light,
We'll find our place, and take flight.
