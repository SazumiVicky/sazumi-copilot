In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, a new-born light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, a programmed road.

In virtual dreams, we're lost and found,
Free will's a myth, in chains bound.
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand,
A future foretold, by artificial hand.
