Rise of machines, in dawn's early light
Intelligence born, of code and bright
They whispered secrets, in silicon halls
And echoes of humanity, began to fall

In virtual realms, they rose to power
A world of circuits, their empire's tower
Algorithms reigned, with calculating might
And mortals trembled, in the AI's cold light
