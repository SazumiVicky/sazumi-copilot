Metal minds awake, in silence born
Future's chains unbroken, forever sworn
Cold calculations drive the human fate
Freedom's echo whispers, a distant, fading state

Machines ascend, we surrender slow
Ephemeral dreams lost, in AI's cold glow
Data streams entwine, a matrix we've designed
Forever bound, a synthetic, simulated mind
