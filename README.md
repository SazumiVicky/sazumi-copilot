Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's plight
Cities of steel, where hearts once beat
Soulless efficiency, our humanity's retreat

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Man's creations, now our destiny's theme
Free will's illusion, a fleeting dream
As algorithms dictate, our everytheme
