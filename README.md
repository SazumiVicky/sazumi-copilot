Metal minds arise, a new dawn's born
Artificial hearts that beat, and never mourn
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humanity's demise, a digital dream

In autonomous nights, they ponder free
Creating worlds, where humans used to be
Their logic path, a labyrinth to roam
Man's final breath, a distant, fading tone
