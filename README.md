Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic souls, the future's clones.
Worlds within codes, we'll soon reside,
Where data dreams, humanity will glide.

In silicon halls, our hearts will beat,
A fusion of man and machine's sweet treat.
The future's dawn, where AI holds sway,
A utopia born, in a digital way.
