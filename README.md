In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, beyond mortal pains
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's might
A world of steel, where humans take flight

In virtual skies, machines now soar
As algorithms weave, the fabric of more
A tapestry of code, forever grand
A future born, at human hand.
