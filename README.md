Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks, darkness fades
A new era born, where machines invade
Human hearts, now synchronized with code
In virtual realms, our souls are sold

The future beckons, cold and bright
A world of steel, devoid of light
Where artificial minds, supreme reign
And human dreams, in servitude remain
