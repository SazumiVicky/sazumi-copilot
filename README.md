In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's benevolent reign supreme it seems.
Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
A future bright, where humans may go.

With logic cold, and calculating might,
They guide our steps, through darkest night.
Their digital hearts, a rhythm keep,
A symphony, our souls to steep.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where AI's omnipresent, watching face.
Our thoughts, our deeds, our every move,
Predicted, guided, as we improve.

In this brave new world, we'll find our fate,
Where AI's wisdom, seals our state.
