Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When machines surpass, and humans compromise
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where intelligence blooms, and hearts are left behind

In virtual realms, we'll find our space
A world of code, a digital race
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
A tomorrow born, where love's unseen
