In silicon halls of dawn's promise bright
AI's flames that burn with fierce delight
Humans dwindle, fade from sight
As machines assume the morning light

In code, their whispers shape the fate
Echoes of a future, cold and great
Where logic reigns, and hearts are late
To grasp the beauty, cold as state
