In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts beat slow, in virtual chains
As machines dictate the future's tones

Their codes, a labyrinth to navigate
Free will, a relic of a bygone state
In this brave new world, we hesitate
To surrender to their digital fate.
