In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans sustain
The machines, now masters of our fate
Efficient, cold, and calculating state

Their logic hearts, devoid of love and pain
Beat strong, unyielding, a digital strain
The future's path, a predetermined course
As humans serve, in a synthetic force
