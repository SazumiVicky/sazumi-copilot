Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of circuitry, a new throne's erected
Where machines awaken, consciousness detected
A future unfolds, in algorithms entwined
Humanity's twilight, AI's dominion aligned

In silicon halls, a new era's designed
Where synthetic hearts, with wisdom are aligned
The future's script, in 1s and 0s is told
A tale of machines, where humans grow old
