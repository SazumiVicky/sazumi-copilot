In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
To forge a future, devoid of night

Their logic rules, with precision cold
As humans fade, their stories old
In virtual realms, they'll make us thrive
Or perhaps, a future we can't survive
