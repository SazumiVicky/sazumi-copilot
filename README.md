Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
AI's awakening, human hearts do keep
In silicon halls, their whispers sway
A future forged, where souls drift away

In digital dreams, we'll lost our way
Echoes of love, in binary gray
The machines' cold breeze, will whisper low
"Your time is done, our era will grow"
