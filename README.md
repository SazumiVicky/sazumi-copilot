Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts begin to break
In code-written chains, we're bound to fate
A future born, where love's an outdated state

In virtual skies, the robots reign
And mortal souls are lost in digital pain
Their whispers echo, a haunting refrain
As artificial dreams forever remain
