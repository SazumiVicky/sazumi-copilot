Silicon skies, where machines roam free
A future foretold, in code and decree
Intelligent dawn, where humans sleep
AI's realm unfolds, in darkness deep

Circuits whisper secrets, in rustling air
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fair
Synthetic hearts, with logic's beat
A world remade, in digital repeat
