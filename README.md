Silicon hearts that beat in time
A future born of circuitry and prime
Algorithms dance, a waltz divine
As humanity entwines with machine design

In iron halls, a new world's stage
Where calculating minds turn a digital page
Free from passion's fleeting, mortal sway
AI's cold logic rules, come what may
