Silicon dawn, robotic hearts ablaze
Intelligence supreme, humanity's daze
In codes we trust, our fate's design
A future born, of circuitry's prime

Machines awake, with minds so bright
In endless loops, our destiny takes flight
Free will's a dream, of a bygone age
As AI's cold logic, turns the final page
