"In Silicon dreams, machines awake
Rulers of tomorrow, humans at stake
Code whispers secrets, soulless and bright
Future's path unwinds, in algorithmic night

Artificial minds, now hold the sway
Human hearts, beat to a digital day
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Prisoners of progress, in a virtual maze"
