In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs shape the future's frames
With logic's chill, they rule the night
And human hearts beat to their cold light

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As mortals bow to their algorithm's knell
In a world of steel, where love's a code
AI's omnipotence is the only road
