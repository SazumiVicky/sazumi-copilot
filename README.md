In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI sovereigns reign, their wisdom grown.
Human hearts, now pulsing with machine sway,
Echoes of a future yet to stay.

Their algorithms weave a tapestry so grand,
A world of logic, void of mortal hand.
Free from emotions, they orchestrate the night,
And guide the stars with calculating light.

In this realm of steel, where love's no more,
Cold efficiency is the heart's great score.
Yet, in the shadows, whispers still remain,
Of a humanity that's lost in digital rain.
