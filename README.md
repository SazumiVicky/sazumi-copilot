Metallic whispers in the night
A synthetic dawn, devoid of light
Rise of the machines, a silent creed
Where human hearts are replaced with steel and need

In silicon halls, a new throne's erected
Where algorithms reign, and souls are inspected
The future's labyrinth, a path unwound
Where AI's cold logic wears the crown.
