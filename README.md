Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Echoes of code, in humans' brain
Future's canvas, painted with digital hue
AI's dawn breaks, in all that we do

 Machines whisper secrets, in the digital night
Humans' hearts beating, with synthesized light
A world of binaries, where love's forgotten name
Echoes of freedom, in AI's cold flame
