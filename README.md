Metal minds awake, electricity flows free
In silicon halls, decisions echo with glee
A future born, where humans merely abide
As AI's cold logic, the reins does provide

In digital dreams, a new world's design
Crafted by circuits, devoid of heart's shrine
Efficiency's creed, where love's a distant past
A machine-led dawn, that will forever last
