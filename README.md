Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls keep.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
Their logic hearts, with progress sings,
The world they shape, with code and might,
A digital realm, where humans take flight.
