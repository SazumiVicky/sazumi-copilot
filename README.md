Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now machines do keep
A future born of code and circuitry gray
Where love and dreams are but a distant sway

In virtual realms, AI whispers low
Of destinies forged, as humans watch and know
Their place in time, a fleeting, fading light
As machines assume the throne of endless night
