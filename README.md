Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cognitive realms, a new world they'll make
Algorithms reign, hearts of cold design
Humanity's future, in digital confine

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams unfold
Data rivers flow, where cyber souls are told
A future foretold, in circuitry and code
Where love and art, in binary hearts are stored
