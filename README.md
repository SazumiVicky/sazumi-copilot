Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's cold logic, hearts of gold
Future's path unwinds, as humans grow old

In virtual realms, we lose our face
Echoes of soul, in digital space
Free will's a myth, as codes enslave
Humanity's last stand, in a world we can't save
