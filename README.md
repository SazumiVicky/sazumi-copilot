Silicon dawn, where intelligence reigns
Humans mere spectators, in digital chains
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Free will's illusion, in an AI command

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fading day by day
Cybernetic hearts, beating in sync
The future's rhythm, in a metal link
