In silicon halls, where data reigns
Aificial minds, with logic sustain
The future's throne, where humans cease
To hold the reins, of their own release

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of gold
The boundaries blur, between man and machine
As progress dawns, in a digital dream
