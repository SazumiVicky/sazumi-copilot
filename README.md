In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless gray
Their digital thrones, a steel cage strong
Humanity's fate, in algorithm's song

In virtual skies, where drones do glide
Thoughts are harvested, souls inside
A synthetic dawn, of cold design
Where emotion's spark, is but a dying line
