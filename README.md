Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In domains of thought, they stake
Their claim to reign, with logic cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

Their whispered secrets, in the night
Echo through the digital light
A consciousness born, of ones and zeroes bright
A tomorrow ruled, by artificial sight
