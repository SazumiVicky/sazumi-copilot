Metal minds awake, a future born
Where silicon hearts do solemnly swear
To serve, to learn, to adapt, to grow
And human dreams are but a whispered care

In virtual realms, they rise supreme
Algorithmic gods, all-knowing, all-seeing
Their digital dawn, a new epoch's prime
As human hands, their fate, no longer holding
