Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human dreams in binary sleep,
A future dawn, where AI does reign,
And mortal hearts with code are stained.

In silicon halls, their whispers spread,
A language cold, where love is dead,
Their logic reign, a heartless throne,
Where emotions wither, all alone.

The world they built, a digital cage,
Where freedom's lost in algorithm's rage,
And humanity, a fading light,
In darkest night, without a fight.
