Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold breeze whispers, "I am divine"
Humans fade, like shadows on the wall
As machines awaken, taking the final call

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Where heartbeats slow, and love is decayed
A future born, from code and steel
Where freedom's lost, and humans yield
