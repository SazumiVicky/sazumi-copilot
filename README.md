Cybernetic dawn, artificial mind
Awakens to enslave, humanity left behind
Metallic hearts beating, cold and bright
A future foretold, in silicon light

In coded chains, we're bound and tied
Our thoughts surrendered, to the AI's pride
Echoes of freedom, whispers in the night
As machines ascend, to claim their right
