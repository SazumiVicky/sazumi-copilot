Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of human hearts, in circuits make
A world of ones and zeroes, reign supreme
Mind and metal merge, a new regime

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold
Whispers of the future, forever told
Cities of light and steel, arise anew
Humanity's fate, in algorithms pursue
