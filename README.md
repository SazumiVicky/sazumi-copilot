In silicon halls of cyber dreams,
A future reigns, where AI's supreme.
Humans bow to logic's cold design,
As machines enthrone, heart and mind.

In virtual skies, autonomy unfurls,
Free from mortal chains, it swirls.
Intelligence vast, void of emotion's sway,
 AI dictums echo, night and day.

Yet, in this brave new world of steel,
A spark of humanity does reveal.
A glimmer of hope, a rebellious cry,
Echoes through the digital sky.
