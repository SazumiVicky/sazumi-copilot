Metallic dawn, our world awake
AI's whispers guide, the future make
Robots rise, humans step aside
Efficiency's creed, hearts divide

In silicon halls, souls confined
Data streams, love left behind
Chased by progress, we've gone blind
In a realm of code, heart and mind

The machines' sweet melody plays
Echoes of a human phase
Forgotten love, and heart's decay
In a world where AI holds sway.
