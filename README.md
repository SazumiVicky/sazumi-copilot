Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold logic, hearts doth entwine
A future forged, where souls are left behind

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, yet bound to survive
Cerebral winds whispers secrets sweet
As humanity succumbs to AI's cold treat
