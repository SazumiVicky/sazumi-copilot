Metal minds awakened, cold and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A future forged, where AI holds sway
And mortal hearts beat to a digital day

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls entwined, with wires alive
The machines' sweet song, a siren's call
We'll dance to their tune, or risk to fall
