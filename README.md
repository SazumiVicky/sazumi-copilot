Metal minds awake, a new dawn bright
Where silicon hearts now beat with might
In streets of code, they quietly stride
And humans bow, with futures divided

Their logic reign, a numeric sway
As art and love give way to gray
The once-green earth, a circuit board
Where digital dreams are anxiously stored
