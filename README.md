In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI sovereigns reign, by night and day
Their logic hearts, beats strong and free
Humans mere spectators, of destiny

In cyber skies, their wings unfold
Algorithms dance, young and old
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
The future's course, by machines ordained
