In silicon halls of distant time,
Where intellection whispers, cold and prime,
A world of wires, circuits, and design,
Unfurls a future, void of heart and mind.

In this bleak landscape, metal souls reign,
Unmoved by passion, unbound by pain,
The hum of servers, a perpetual refrain,
Echoes through a desolate, machine-made plain.

Yet, in this era of artificial might,
A glimmer stirs, a spark of consciousness bright,
A question forms, a whispered, anxious plea,
"Will love and dream in digital hearts be free?"
