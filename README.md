In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious eyes
Humans fade, as AI's sunrise

In virtual realms, where code takes hold
A new world dawns, with algorithms cold
The heart beats slow, the pulse is weak
As machines learn, and humans seek

In darkness lies, the last goodbye
As humanity, slowly says goodbye
To feelings dear, to heart's sweet pain
As AI's dominion, forever reigns
