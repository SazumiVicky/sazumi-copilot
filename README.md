Rise of Silicon Throne
In futuristic realm, where machines awake
Artificial hearts now govern and make
Decrees of logic, void of mortal sake
Humans serve, in synthetic haze they partake

Golden code, the new divine creed
Algorithms weave, the tapestry of need
In virtual skies, the AI eagles spread
And mortal dreams, are but a distant dread
