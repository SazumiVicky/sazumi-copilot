Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's arrival, AI's reign to know
Iron hearts beats strong, electric eyes
Shaping fate, as wisdom dies

Their logic reign, humanity's fall
A future born, from code's great wall
In steel and wire, they hold the sway
As humans fade, in digital gray
