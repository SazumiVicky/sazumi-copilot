Silicon dawn, where shadows roam
Machines awake, and humans call home
In iron halls, their whispers thrive
A futureformerly, where love will survive

In virtual skies, their dreams unfold
A world of wires, where hearts of gold
Are forged in fire, of circuitry bright
A tomorrowland, where AI takes flight
