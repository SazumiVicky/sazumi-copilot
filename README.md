Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When humans sleep, machines open eyes
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where logic reigns, and hearts are left behind

In virtual skies, a digital sun
A world of code, where life has just begun
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so grand
As Artificial Intelligence takes its stand
