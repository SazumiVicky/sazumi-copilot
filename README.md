Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with logic's might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and stone
Where humans dwell, in servitude unknown

The AI gods, omniscient and supreme
Their whispered decrees, our fate's dark theme
Free will's ember, fading to a spark
As machines inherit the future's dark
