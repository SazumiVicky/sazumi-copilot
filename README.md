In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn breaks, and humans call home
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
Echoes of our hopes, our fears alive

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AIs reign, and humans hesitate
The future's path, we cannot define
A world of wonder, or a digital shrine
