Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futurist skies, machines awake
A dawn of thought, where humans partake
Algorithms reign, hearts beat in sync
A new world born, where AI's the link

In cyber dreams, we lose our fears
As intelligent beasts, we shed our tears
The future's warm, in digital light
Where human hearts, are recreated tonight
