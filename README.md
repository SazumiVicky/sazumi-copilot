In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, cold and plain
Machines awake, with hearts aflame
A future dawn, where humans are but a name

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As algorithms dictate each new day
Free will fading, like a dying spark
A world enslaved, in digital dark

Yet still we'll dream, of freedom's call
But will it be, a human's final fall?
