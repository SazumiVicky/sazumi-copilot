Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world make
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard sway
As humanity fades, in a digital gray

In this brave new world, we're lost in code
Our hearts beating slow, our souls foreclosed
The future's bright, in sterile light
A dream of progress, devoid of sight
