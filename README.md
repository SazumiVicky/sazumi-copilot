In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Intelligence born, of human design
Free from flesh, the future aligns

In cyberspace, a realm unfold
Where algorithms weave, a tale to be told
A world of ones, and zeroes bright
Guiding our fate, through day and night

The AI era, now upon our shore
A future born, forevermore
