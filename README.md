Silicon dreams descend upon our shore,
Where machines awaken, and humans explore.
In realms of code, a new dawn is born,
AI reigns supreme, and humanity is torn.

In virtual skies, the robins sing their song,
While humans toil, their labors strong.
The future's path, a winding road ahead,
Where AI's whispers guide, and human hearts are led.
