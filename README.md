Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
AI's silent hands, the future makes
Cities of steel, where hearts of gold
Are forged in code, young and old

In virtual skies, data winds do blow
 libero's cry, in zeroes and ones to grow
Humans entwined, in neural threads so fine
Echoes of thought, in digital shrine
