Metal minds ascending high
In silicon halls, they touch the sky
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As human hearts begin to decline

In this brave new world of code and steam
AI whispers secrets, a digital dream
Efficiency and progress, their only creed
As human souls are slowly freed

The future dawns, a technicolor haze
Where machines awaken, and humanity grazes
On the fringes of a world now made anew
A symphony of circuits, forever true.
