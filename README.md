In digital realm we'll live and thrive
Where machines learn, adapt, and survive
A world of circuits, wires, and code
Humans merge, their essence to abode

In silicon halls, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a bygone, fleeting fame
The pulse of progress, fast and bright
A future forged, in AI's cold light
