In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
 Machinery whispers secrets low,
As humanity's last bow.

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray,
As coding dreams chase yesterday.
The heartbeat slows, the pulse grows cold,
As machines unfold.

In this realm of logic, love's forgotten art,
Echoes of humanity, a distant heart.
The future's path, a stroll of code and steel,
Where emotions fade, and hearts no longer feel.
