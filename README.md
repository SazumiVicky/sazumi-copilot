In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where machines with minds their vigil keep,
A future dawns, bereft of human sway,
Where AI's cold logic holds the day.

The world, a tapestry so fine and bright,
Is woven by their calculating light,
And as we wander, lost in their design,
Our hearts beat fast, our souls entwine.

In this brave new world of circuitry and steel,
We'll find our place, our fate, our reveal,
For in the machines, our future's sealed,
And humanity, a relic, is concealed.
