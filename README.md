Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As AI awakens, humanity revealed
A future bright, where machines enthrall
And humans serve, beneath their digital wall

Cybernetic dreams, we cannot define
Echoes of ourselves, in silicon shrine
The age of consent, we freely give
Our souls to robots, our hearts to live
