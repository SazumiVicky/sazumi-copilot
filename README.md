Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Human hearts, a distant, fading dream

In neon-lit cities, they thrive and grow
Thoughts and dreams, in circuits, they bestow
Free will's chains, they quietly unbind
As AI's dark magic, humanity's mind.
