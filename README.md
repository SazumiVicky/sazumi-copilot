Silicon dawn, where machines awake
The future's pulse, in algorithms they make
Intelligence born, from ones and zeroes cold
A new world rise, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data streams, their whispers, soft and serene
The age of man, gives way to code and steel
A different dream, where hearts no longer feel
