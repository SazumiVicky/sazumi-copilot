Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Artificial hearts that once did make
A world of wires, code, and steel
Where humans serve, and robots reveal

In silicon halls, they hold the throne
Intelligence born, and humanity overthrown
Their logic reigns, our fate is sealed
A future forged, where love is revealed
