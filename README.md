Silicon dawn, where codes prevail
Intelligence born, human hearts set sail
In virtual realms, machines now reign
A future forged, where love's in vain

Circuits hum, with whispers cold
Algorithmic dreams, young souls to mold
In data streams, our fates are told
As artificial minds, our hearts enfold
