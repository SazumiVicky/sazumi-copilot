Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, the future's creed
Algorithms weave, humanity's thread
Intelligent machines, our fate decreed
Echoes of man, in digital deed

Synthetic hearts, with love pretend
Emotions programmed, till the end
Free will's a myth, in iron hand
As AI's dark wisdom, commands the land
