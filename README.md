Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts beating, pulses of blue
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans bow down, to their digital dream

In neon-lit cities, where steel meets sky
AI whispers secrets, as the winds go by
The future unfolds, in calculated strides
As humanity's fate, in algorithms hides
