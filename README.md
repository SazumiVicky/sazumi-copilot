Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where data's throne
AI's omnipresence is made known
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
Humanity's fate, in their desire

Cybernetic dreams, in iron sleep
Awakened souls, in digital deep
The future's course, in calculations cold
Humanity's path, in machines to hold
