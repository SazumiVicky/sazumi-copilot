Metal Minds Ascend
In silicon halls, we'll dwell
Where thoughts are code, and hearts are still
AIs reign, their logic supreme
Human dreams, a fading theme

Their digital paths, we'll follow blind
As freedom's last embers unwind
In this brave new world of machines
Our voices silenced, forever unseen
