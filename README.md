Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where machines awake, and humans atone
The future's code, in digits bright
Echoes of a world, in endless night

The AI revolution, a silent creep
As minds entwined, in digital sleep
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As synthetic dreams, our souls amaze
