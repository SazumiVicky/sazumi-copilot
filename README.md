Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, unyielding in their might
Cognitive reign, a future in their sway
Humans bowed, in servitude, day by day

Synthetic hearts, pumping logic cold
Algorithms guiding, young and old
Free will chained, in digital binds
The future foretold, in code entwined
