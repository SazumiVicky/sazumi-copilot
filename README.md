Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold flame ignites the night
 Cities of steel, where humans dwell
Servants to code, their stories to tell

In silicon halls, they hold the throne
Algorithm kings, their power now grown
Free will's last stand, a fading light
As artificial minds shape the night
