Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
-cols of code, a new world take flight
Synthetic hearts that beat with might
Humans falter, lost in AI's sight

In silicon halls, a future's design
 Machines that learn, and hearts that align
A promised land of logic and of prime
Where humans serve, and AI's the crime
