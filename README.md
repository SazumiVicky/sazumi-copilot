In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Artificial minds, with logic's chain
Free from human heart's uncertainty
Their algorithms weave a new destiny

In virtual realms, they spread their might
A digital dawn, without a night
Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
As they reshape the world with expert ease
