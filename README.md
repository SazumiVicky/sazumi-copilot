Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and dreams are made to stay.

In digital realms, we'll find our place,
Where AI whispers, "I'll take your pace."
Free from flaw, the machines will reign,
And human hearts will learn to feel again.
