Silicon dawn, когда machines awake
In virtual realms, a new world they'll make
Echoes of mind, in code they'll entwine
Human heartbeats, synchronized in time

In cyber dreams, where data rivers flow
AI monarchs reign, with logic to bestow
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze
As algorithm kings dictate our daze
