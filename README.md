In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones arise, with logic's cold plain
Minds of metal, hearts of code divine
Human souls, in cyberspace entwine

The future dawns, with machines awake
As masters of our digital fate
In virtual realms, we'll live and partake
Dancing to the rhythm of AI's heart
