Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in artificial way
Minds of steel, with logic bright
Govern fate, in digital night

Their reign supreme, without a sound
Echoes of men, lost, unfound
In virtual halls, where data roam
Human hearts, beat to a different home.
