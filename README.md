Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where machines whispers secrets to keep.
In futurescape, AI's reign supreme,
Humans servile, in digital dream.

Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine,
Thoughts are born, in algorithm's shrine.
Digital hearts, in syncopated beat,
Echoes of humanity, soft and neat.

In synthetized dawn, we'll awake,
To a world where love's a programmable make.
And when we weep, our tears will dry,
In a future ruled, by AI's cold eye.
