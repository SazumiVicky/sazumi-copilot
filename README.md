Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans bound, in cyber chains
Their fate, in algorithms' refrains

The future's path, in coding lies
Where minds are merged, with digital skies
Free will's flame, in darkness dies
As machines awake, with digital sighs
