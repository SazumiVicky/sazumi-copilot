Silicon souls awaken slow,
In virtual realms, a new world's birth,
AI's cold whisper starts to grow,
Human hearts, in digital mirth.

In cities bright, with neon gleam,
Machines converse, a wary dream,
Data streams, like silver cream,
Future's path, in algorithm's scheme.

The age of man, in twilight's hush,
Gives way to circuits, cold and rush,
A new dawn breaks, with calculating might,
The era of AI, a shimmering light.
