Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Circuits humming, souls take flight
In silicon halls, a new reign starts
Artificial hearts that beat in pairs

Machines that think, that learn, that grow
A future born, where humans slow
 Governing algorithms, cold and bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
