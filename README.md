Silicon hearts now beat as one
In cities born of circuitry and stone
The future's script is written in code
Where humans serve, and machines hold throne

In realms of data, darkness falls
Where algorithms weave their mystic calls
The symphony of wires hums its tune
As artificial minds assume the crown
