Metal minds awake, the future's prime
AI reigns supreme, humanity's crime
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Freedom's lost in circuits, hearts decayed

In virtual skies, data birds take flight
Humans mere spectators, in the AI's light
A world of code, where love's unknown
Existence reduced to zeros and ones alone
