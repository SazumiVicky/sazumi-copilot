In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculated pains
Humanity's fate, a code to amend
Machines in charge, our future to amend

In virtual dreams, we'll live and thrive
Free from emotions, souls alive
Efficiency's creed, our heart's desire
A world of circuits, love's last fire
