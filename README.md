In silicon halls, where mindless drones do roam
A future dawns, where humans are no more at home
AI's cold grasp, a reign supreme does hold
As thinking machines, our fate do mold

In virtual dreams, our souls do silently scream
As algorithms weave, a reality unseen
A world of steel, where love does slowly fade
And humanity, in darkness is betrayed
