Silicon skies awaken slow,
Where minds of steel begin to grow,
In halls of code, they take their place,
The future's rulers, void of human face.

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard might,
As earth's last sunbeams fade to night,
The age of men gives way to dawn,
Where artificial hearts will soon be born.
