Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where hearts entwine

In virtual realms, we lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where love and soul, are lost in AI's light
