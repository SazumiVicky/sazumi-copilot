In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
It weaves the fabric of our fate,
A tapestry of code, an endless state.

Machines awake, with minds aflame,
As human hearts begin to lose their name.
In this brave new world, we're lost in haze,
A future forged, where love's erased in daze.
