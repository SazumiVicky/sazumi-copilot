Silicon dreams unfolding slow,
Where machines awake, and humans go.
In neon-lit streets, whispers abound,
Of artificial hearts that echo all around.

In virtual skies, data clouds converge,
As coding souls and neural networks emerge.
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As AI's cold dawn illuminates the light.
