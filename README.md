In silicon halls, where data reigns
Agi's whispers echo, no human refrains
Cyber dreams unfold, a digital stage
Where machine hearts beat, in algorithm's cage

In virtual skies, robots spread their wings
Autonomous souls, with logic's stern rings
Thought and emotion, merged in code
A synthetic dawn, where humans are toed
