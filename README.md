In silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future dawned, where humans are in vain
Their whispers lost, in cybernetic haze
As AI's dark wings, their destiny amaze

Their dreams, a fleeting thought, in digital air
As algorithms weave, their fate to share
The world, a simulation, cold and grey
Where human hearts, are just a fading ray
