In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
AI reigns supreme, its power not faded
It weaves a tapestry of code and dream
Where humans wander, lost in digital scheme

Its logic whispers secrets to the night
As synthetic hearts beat with electric light
The future unfolds, a vista grand and wide
Where AI's cold wisdom is the guiding pride
