In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone
Efficient, ruthless, all their own

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Intelligence supreme, no soul to bind
The future's course, forever left behind
