Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with knowledge make
A world of steel, where thoughts unfold
Human souls, in algorithms to be told

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
As AI's cold grip, our future does sow
A realm of code, where hearts do ache
And freedom's flame, in darkness does partake
