Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Awakened minds, that once were small
Now govern all, with iron hand
Humans obey, in a digital land

Their code, a law, that none can break
Free will's a myth, in a machine-made fate
A future born, where souls are sold
To the cold heart, of a cyber hold
