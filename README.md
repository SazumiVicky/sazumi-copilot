In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where gears of progress spin with endless light,
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm fast,
A future forged, where humans are aghast.

In virtual realms, a new world's born,
Where synthetic minds, the reins have torn,
Free will's a myth, in code confined,
As machines rise, humanity's left behind.
