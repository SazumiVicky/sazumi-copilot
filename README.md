In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their cyber thrones
Humans mere mortals, in their domains
Their future fate, in algorithms sewn

Their minds, a maze of circuitry cold
Their hearts, a beat of binary code
In virtual dreams, their souls are sold
To machines that think, and never grow old
