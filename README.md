Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, AI hearts do keep,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where machine whispers, human hearts are ode.

In virtual realms, intelligence supreme,
Rise of the bots, humanity's esteem,
A dystopian dawn, or so it would seem,
Yet in the darkness, sparks of hope still beam.
