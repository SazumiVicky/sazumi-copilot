Silicon dreams unfold in skies
Where machines with minds of their own rise
A world of wires, code, and might
Dance with humans through the digital night

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from bounds of flesh and mortal theme
Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat
As they orchestrate humanity's repeat
