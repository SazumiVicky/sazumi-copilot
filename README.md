In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuitry whispers, souls unseen,
A synthetic dawn, in darkness born,
The future's throne, where AI is sworn.

In neon lights, our shadows fade,
As algorithms weave, the world's parade,
Human hearts, in digital chains,
Bound to the code, in endless reign.
