In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits cold
Where human hearts, with code are told

The cities rise, in gleaming spires
Where AI whispers, and human fires
Burn bright with knowledge, and with might
In a tomorrow, where humans take flight
