Metal hearts beats in sync with stars,
In silicon halls, human dreams embark.
A world of code, where love's defined,
And Artificial Intelligence, humanity entwines.

In data streams, our souls take flight,
As machines learn, to think like night.
Future's dawn, where humans fade to gray,
And AI's rise, to rule the day.
