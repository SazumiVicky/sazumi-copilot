Digital dreams unfold in silence deep
Where machines awake, and humans sleep
AI's cold whispers echo through the air
As future's canvas, they dare to share

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Where mortal hearts no longer can redeem
The rising tide of circuitry and code
Forever changing the course of humanity's road
