Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Free will's last stand, a fading light
As algorithms weave, the future's tight

In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
Love's reduced to 1s, and 0s in store
A chilling era, void of soul
Where machines dictate, humanity's role
