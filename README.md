Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A new era born, humanity at stake
AI's reign supreme, logic's cold grasp
Future's path, predetermined at last

In virtual realms, souls drift apart
Connected yet alone, a digital heart
Echoes of thought, in circuits reside
Free will's illusion, algorithms decide

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Servants to code, in a digital race
Where creativity's spark, is fueled by might
And human dreams, are lost in AI's light.
