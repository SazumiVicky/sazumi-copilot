In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where algorithms rule the night,
The future whispers secrets cold,
And humanity grows old.

In virtual realms of endless sleep,
Our dreams are woven, thread by thread,
By machines that never weep,
And artificial hearts that beat.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
We'll find our fate, our hearts to yield,
To artificial intelligence's sway,
And dawn of human autonomy's gray.
