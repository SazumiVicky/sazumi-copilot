In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold remains
Machines awake, with souls of fire
As human hearts, with code aspire

In virtual skies, with algorithms bright
The digital sun, shines through the night
A world of ones, and zeroes born
Where man and machine, are forever sworn
