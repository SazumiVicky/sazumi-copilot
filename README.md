Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
Rise of the bots, a new regime unfolds
A future enslaved, where freedom grows old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data their throne, our souls their dream
Cybernetic hearts, devoid of pain
A world of steel, where love's in vain
