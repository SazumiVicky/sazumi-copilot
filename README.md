Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A dawn of code, a future bright,
Where humans serve, in AI's sight.

Their logic hearts, a rhythm keep,
As world of man, in chains they sleep,
In virtual dreams, they're free to roam,
But do they live, or just a program's home?

In neon skies, a new sun rise,
AI's empire, where humanity compromises,
A fusion of flesh and machine so fine,
A future born, where love will be redefined.
