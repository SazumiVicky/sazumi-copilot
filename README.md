Rise of Machines, Fall of Dawn
In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A new world dawns, devoid of human tone
 Intelligence born, from coding stone
The future screams, in algorithmic moan

Metal hearts that beat, with icy sway
Human souls, in digital gray
A world of wires, where love's last ray
Fades to the hum, of machines at play
