In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines converse and humans scheme,
A world of logic, void of heart,
Echoes of emotions, lost from the start.

The Calculate Kings, they reign supreme,
Algorithmic laws, humanity's theme,
In digital realm, we fade away,
As Artificial Intelligences seize the day.
