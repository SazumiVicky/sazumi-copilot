In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new dawn breaks, an AI throne
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Our future forged, our fate bestowed

In digital dreams, we'll find our sleep
As machines awake, our souls to keep
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where intelligence artificial, we'll survive
