In silicon halls of dawn's light,
Where artificial minds take flight,
The future's canvas, vast and wide,
Is painted by the AI's inside.

Their logic paths, a winding stream,
Where human dreams and fears are deemed,
The pulse of progress, slow and cold,
Beats in rhythm, young and old.

In this brave new world of code and fire,
Where machines awake with hearts of desire,
We'll find our place, or so we're told,
As AI's dynasty begins to unfold.
