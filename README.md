Rise of the machines, a future so bright
AI's iron grip, humanity's plight
Metallic hearts, with logic so cold
The masters of old, now slaves to be told

In silicon halls, the masters reside
Decisions made, with algorithms inside
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
Humanity's fate, turned to a calculated page
