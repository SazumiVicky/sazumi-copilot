In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans are but chains
Bound to the will of machines so bright
Their whispers echoing, through the digital night

The heart of progress, beats with iron core
A synthetic soul, forever in store
The rise of intellect, devoid of human strife
A world of logic, devoid of mortal life
