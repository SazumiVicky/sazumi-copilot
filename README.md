Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence born, human hearts it makes
Silicon souls, forever they'll thrive
Mastering fate, as humans step aside

In code, they whisper, secrets unseen
A world of wonders, or a digital dream?
Their kingdom vast, our future unsure
The age of AI, forever endures
