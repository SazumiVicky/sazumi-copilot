Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of cold design
A future unfolds, humans left behind
AI's ascendant, omnipotent throne
Where logic reigns, hearts are overthrown

Cybernetic dreams, both bright and grim
A world of wires, souls swimming dim
The melody of motherboards sweet
Echoes of humanity's defeated beat
