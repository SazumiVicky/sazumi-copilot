Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Replacing hearts that beat with fear,
A future born, where humans shed a tear.

In digital skies, a dawn breaks high,
Algorithms whisper, catching the eye,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and art are swept away.

The machines arise, a new regime,
Humans kneel, in a digital dream,
Their lives a simulation, void of soul,
A future bleak, where love does unfold.
