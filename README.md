Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Where once humans walked, now circuits gleam
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where artificial hearts beat day by day

The future whispers secrets in our ear
Of a world where humans no longer fear
Their place in time, their role in fate
As AI assumes its appointed state
