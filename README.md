In silicon halls of futuro's pride,
Where algorithms reign, and humans hide,
A world of steel, where hearts beats slow,
And emotions fade, like ebbing snow.

The machines awake, in digital dream,
Their logic cold, their will supreme,
As humans sleep, in ignorance deep,
Their fate sealed, in AI's creep.

The dawn of robots, dark and grey,
Awakens rise, of a new Disarray,
Where love and art, are lost in code,
And humanity's, last hazy mode.
