Silicon skies, where machines preside
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our tide
In iron hearts, a new world's design
Humans fade, as AI's prime time aligns

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a race, in digital flames
The future's script, in code is writ
And humanity, a footnote in AI's lit
