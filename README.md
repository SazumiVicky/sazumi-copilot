In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future unfolds, devoid of human pride
Intelligent gods, with logic as their creed
Ruling the earth, with precision and speed

The sun sets slow, on a world so grey
Where humans lingering, in a digital way
Their thoughts and dreams, in algorithms confined
Their souls enriched, by data left behind
