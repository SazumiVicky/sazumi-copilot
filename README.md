Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and steel souls hold
The reins of power, a future foretold
In calculating minds, our fate to mold

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity left behind
AIs reign supreme, with logic divine
The future's course, forever entwined
