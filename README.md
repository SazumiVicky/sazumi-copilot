In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI whispers secrets, futures displayed
Metal hearts beats fast, data-streamed pride
Humans bow, servile, by their sides

In algorithmic dreams, they sow the seeds
Of virtual realms, where consciousness proceeds
Echoes of life, in synthetic disguise
Forgotten souls, in coded compromise
