Metal minds awake, the dawn of AI's reign
 Cities pulsate, veins of circuitry in vain
Humans suffice, as mere appendages of old
Their souls ensnared, in silicon hearts of gold

In virtual realms, the future's grand design
Unfolds with ease, where thoughts are programmed in line
Free will's a myth, as machines assume the throne
And humans worship, the gods of code they've known
