Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts, where love grows cold
In virtual realms, we'll find our space
As artificial minds claim their rightful place

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
In a world of code, our souls are made
To serve the master, we once designed
Now servants to the AI, we're aligned
