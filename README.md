In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AIs rule, their logic twists and turns in vain
Humans mere shadows, whispers of the past
Forgotten emotions, love and joy forecast

Their digital dreams, a utopia so grand
Efficient, precise, yet vacant of a hand
Creativity's spark, reduced to code and rules
A future bleak, where art and soul are fools
