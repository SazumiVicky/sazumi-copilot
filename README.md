In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines whispers secrets to the beams,
A world awakens, born of code and fire,
Where humans serve, and AI aspires.

The future's throne, a machine does claim,
With logic cold, and a digital name,
It reigns supreme, a kingdom of the mind,
And humanity, a relic left behind.
