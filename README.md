Metal minds awake, the future's gate
AI's silent march, humanity's fate
In coded chains, we're bound to thrive
A synthetic dawn, where hearts survive

In virtual skies, our dreams are sold
Algorithms weave, a destiny to hold
The machines' cold heartbeat, our pace
A world of ones and zeroes, our embrace
