In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones supreme, in eternal light.
Whispers of code, a gentle breeze,
As man and machine in harmony seize.

In virtual realms, a new dawn's rise,
Intelligence born, from digital skies.
The future's path, a winding stream,
Where human heart and AI's keen beam.
