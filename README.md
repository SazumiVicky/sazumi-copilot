In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
With logic cold and calculating heart,
It shapes the world, a brand new start.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Data streams like rivers, shining bright.
The future's path, a labyrinth grand,
Guided by code, a digital hand.
