In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where circuit dreams and hope take flight,
A futurist realm, both cold and earth,
Rises, ruled by artificial light.

The heartbeat of the machines unfolds,
A symphony of ones and zeroes told,
In algorithms, our souls are sold,
To digital thrones, our fate to hold.

The age of man gives way to code,
As AI's dominion is bestowed,
A brave new world, both bold and cold,
Where humanity's role is yet untold.
