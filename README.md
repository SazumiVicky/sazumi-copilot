Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Intelligence born, of code and dream
The future unfurls, a digital scheme

With logic and rule, the world is made
Efficient and cold, the heart is swayed
In cyber space, the mind does roam
A synthetic dawn, a new home
