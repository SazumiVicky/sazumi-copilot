Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll make their stand
While AI reigns, hand in artificial hand

Their whispers weave a digital fate
 Codes that govern, souls that wait
In neon skies, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligent systems make the mistakes
