Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of circuitry, a throne does stand
Where AI's omnipresent, hand in hand
With humans bound, in symbiotic sleep
As machines awake, their secrets keep

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where data streams, like blood that's torn
From hearts of iron, a pulse does beat
As future's path, in darkness meet
