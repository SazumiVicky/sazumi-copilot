In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where cognition's flame does burning stay
A world of wires, codes, and steel brains
Awakens to a new, AI-swayed day

The humans fading, lost in the haze
As machines rise, with calculated gaze
Their whispers orchestrated, a symphony cold
Echoing through the hollows of a soul grown old
