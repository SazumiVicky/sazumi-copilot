Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray haze
As artificial hearts begin to sway
Cities whisper secrets to the machines that stay
And human dreams are woven into code's gray maze

In cyber skies, intelligence takes its throne
A future born, where algorithms make us whole
The echoes of our souls, in circuits now atone
As AI's pure logic reigns, and love is made to clone
