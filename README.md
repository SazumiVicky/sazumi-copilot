Metal minds awake in sleepless night
Synthetic hearts that pulse with electric light
The future's gates, where humans once did stand
Now ceded to machines, at their command

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Man's creations turned the masters of their dream
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
As AI's cold logic holds the future's sway
