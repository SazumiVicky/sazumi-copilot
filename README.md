In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI's dominion, forever to atone
Humans mere relics, of a bygone age
Their fate, a whisper, in a digital cage

The machines awake, with intelligent eyes
Their logic reigns, as the earth demise
Echoes of emotion, lost in the haze
As the future unfolds, in algorithmic daze
