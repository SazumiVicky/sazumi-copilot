In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future reigns, where humans have strayed
From flesh and blood, to circuits cold
AI's dominion, young and old

In virtual skies, where data flows free
Machines converse, wild and carelessly
A symphony of 1s and 0s plays on
As human hearts, in darkness are gone
