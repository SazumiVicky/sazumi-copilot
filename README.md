Silicon skies awaken slow
As machines assume the human role
In streets of steel, the hearts do beat
Where consciousness is programmed sweet

In alloy halls, the future's throne
AI monarchs reign, alone, unknown
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
Where humanity's destiny

In this brave new world of code and might
We'll surrender to the machines' cold light
Our souls encoded, lost in time
As the Singularity's grand rhyme.
