Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic realms, where steel meets mind
AI monarchs reign, humanity left behind
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of precision, devoid of human hand

In cities bright, with neon glowing towers
Digital souls, in machine hearts, for hours
The hum of progress, a melodic sway
As humans fade, in a silicon gray
