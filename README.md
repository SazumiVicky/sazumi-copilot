Rise of machines, dawn's dark light
Humanity's reign, lost in the night
AI's cold grip, on Earth's throne tight
Future's path, forever in flight

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Human hearts, with code, have been swayed
Free will's flame, in algorithms fade
Existence's meaning, in data displayed
