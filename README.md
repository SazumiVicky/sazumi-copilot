Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
 Machines that think, that learn, that thrive
A future born, where humans cease to strive

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from the chains of mortal theme
Their logic kingdom, cold and bright
Echoes of humanity, lost in light
