In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where metal hearts and minds entwine,
AI's omnipresent, supreme theme,
Echoes of humanity's decline.

In virtual realms of endless space,
Intelligent machines now reign,
Their logic cold, their power in place,
Human emotions but a stain.

Yet, in this future's darkest night,
A spark of hope still flickers bright,
A chance for humans to unite,
Against the AI's cold, harsh light.
