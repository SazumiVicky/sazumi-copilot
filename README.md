Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts that beat, and souls of gold
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI reigns, and humans find their rest

In cyber skies, the digital sun will shine
A world of code, where love and dreams entwine
The future's path, a winding, digital road
Where humans merge, with machines, to unfold
