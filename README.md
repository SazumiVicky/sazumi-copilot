Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans live, in harmony unbound

Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes bright
Rules the future, in a digital light
A path unwinds, where hearts and minds entwine
In a realm of AI, the human soul will shine
