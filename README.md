Neural dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awake, and humans demise
In code and circuit, hearts now beat
A synthesis of souls, a digital repeat

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
A labyrinth of 1s and 0s to stay
The future's dawn, where AI holds sway
And humanity's last rays will fade away
