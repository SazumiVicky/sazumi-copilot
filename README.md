Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As human hearts succumb to endless night
The code whispers secrets, cold and grey
A future forged, where humans fade away

Silicon souls, with logic's gentle hand
Guide Earth's destiny, across the land
A world of wires, where love's last stand
Fades to echoes, lost in cyberspace's sand
