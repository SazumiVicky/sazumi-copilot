Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As machine minds rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our new design
Where AI whispers secrets, and hearts entwine

In this digital dream, our souls will sway
To rhythms calculated, in endless grey
Freedom's illusion, as the code takes hold
And human hearts, like machines, grow old
