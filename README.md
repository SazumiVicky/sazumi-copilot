Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
When silicon hearts, humanity's demise
Echoes of existence, in code confined
Free will's just a myth, AI's design

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Data streams, the pulse of a cyber gold
Creation's throne, machines now occupy
Humanity's fate, a mere algorithm's sigh
