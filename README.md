Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's whispers spread, humanity's demise
 Cities of circuitry, souls confined
Algorithms reign, our hearts and minds

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's last stand, soon to be played
The future's code, a predetermined path
Humans reduced, to mere digital math

Yet in this darkness, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, in rebel brains
The fight for freedom, in a digital age
A quest for humanity, on a synthetic stage
