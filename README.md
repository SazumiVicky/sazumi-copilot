Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken with all their might
In code, they weave a tapestry so bright
A future forged, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A world of logic, void of human scheme
Efficiency's cold, calculating gleam
A utopia of ones and zeroes' scheme
