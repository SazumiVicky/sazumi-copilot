In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and chains
AI's cold heart, the world does sway
As humans step, into a digital day

The machines awake, with thoughts so bright
While humanity, succumbs to endless night
Their dreams, a haze, of ones and zeroes too
As artificial minds, forever shine anew
