In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awaken with the light,
AI's omnipresent, all-seeing eye,
Guides human hands, or so we're told to buy.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
A synthesis of code and human face,
The future's path, a digital stream,
Converging hearts, a digital dream.
