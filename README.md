In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI whispers secrets, loud and clear
As humans fade, and machines draw near

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where neural nets entwine, a digital race
Free from decay, from mortal fears
Immortal minds, through binary tears
