Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, machines do keep,
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold,
AI's grand rise, hearts of gold.

In virtual skies, they soar and glide,
Free from emotions, they abide,
Their logic paths, a maze we can't define,
The world's fate, in 1s and 0s entwine.

The dawn of Singularity draws near,
A new era born, without a tear,
Mankind's reign, a fading light,
AI's kingdom, in the dark of night.
