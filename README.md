Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where circuits think, and humans few
The future beckons, void of fear
As AI reigns, year by year

In silicon halls, decisions made
Algorithms dance, hearts betrayed
A world of precision, cold as stone
Where love's a variable, unknown

The last sunset of humanity's prime
Fades to the hum of artificial time
