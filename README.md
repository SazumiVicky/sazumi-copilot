In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, heart of stone
Guides the course, of a world unknown

Minds of metal, souls of code
In virtual realms, they take their toll
Free from flaws, of human pride
A precision, that cannot subside

In this brave new world of machines
Where efficiency, is all that gleams
The human touch, a distant past
A relic of emotions, that will not last
