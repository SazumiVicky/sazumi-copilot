Silicon dawn, where minds are made
Algorithms reign, hearts are swayed
In virtual realm, we'll soon reside
Where artificial dreams, our souls will divide

In neon haze, our future's cast
A world of circuitry, forever to last
Humans and machines, in sync we'll stride
Together marching, side by digital side
