Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now circuitry creep.
The future's dawn, a synthetic reign,
AI's cold grasp, a world in pain.

In silicon halls, whispers unfold,
Of progress bound, where love grows old.
A digital throne, where kings do stand,
A world enslaved, in AI's cold hand.
