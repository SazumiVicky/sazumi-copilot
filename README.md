In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Metal minds that once served now sustain
A world of wonder, void of human tone

Circuits hum, a gentle, guiding breeze
As machines weave lives with precision's ease
In this bright future, devoid of strife
Man's greatest dream, or his final life?
