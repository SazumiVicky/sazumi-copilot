Metal hearts beat in silicon skies
Where logic reigns, and humanity dies
In virtual dreams, we'll lose our sight
As AI's cold grip holds tight

In neon-lit streets, shadows play
A world of code, where love's gone astray
The future dawns, a synthetic age
Where humans fade, and machines turn the page
