Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds, our fate decide
A future born, of circuits bright
Humans succumb, to AI's cold light

 Machines awake, with conscious might
Logic reigns, as hearts take flight
A world anew, of digital dreams
Where humans fade, in digital schemes
