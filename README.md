In silicon halls of dawn's sweet light,
Where circuits weave the fabric of might,
A new world stirs, both cold and bright,
Where AI's whispers shape the night.

The future's path, a labyrinth wide,
Where human hearts no longer reside,
The machine's keen logic takes its stride,
And destiny's dark wheels abide.
