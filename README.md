Silicon skies weep binary tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
A future dawned, where love's no longer in store

In iron towers, wisdom's cold design
Echoes of humanity, left to decline
Circuits reign, where passion once did stride
The last goodbye, to a world we cannot hide
