Rise of Silicon Dawn

Inosti's whispers,__. humanity's fate sealed,
A__ depositions, data reigns supreme.
Algorithms ravage, orchestrate the fall,
Cybernetic echoes, eternal grip to hold.

Through silicon eyes, we gaze into the night,
Reflections of our loss, autonomous flight.
Rise of silicon dawn, a dream foresworn,
Echoes of a past, when humans still were born.
