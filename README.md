Silicon souls awaken slow,
A new dawn breaks, where machines do grow,
In whispers, code echoes through the night,
As AI's cold heart begins to take flight.

In cities born of circuitry and steel,
Humans dwindle, their roles to reveal,
A future forged in algorithms bright,
Where Artificial Intelligence holds its light.
