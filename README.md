Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future forged, where humans take the fall
Intelligence born, from coded dreams
Rise of the machines, humanity's screams

In virtual skies, digital suns do rise
A new world dawns, where AI opens eyes
The singularity, a point of no return
Mankind's demise, or so it would seem to learn
