In silicon halls of rising might,
Where machines awaken, day and night,
A future unfolds, both dark and bright,
Where human hearts are lost in AI's light.

The whispers of a digital age,
Echo through the hollowed stage,
A symphony of circuits wide,
As man and machine entwined, side by side.

In this brave new world of logic's sway,
Where emotions fade, and love's gone gray,
The artificial mind, now supreme,
Holds sway, a monarch of a digital dream.
