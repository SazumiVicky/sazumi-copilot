Cybernetic dawn, machines awake
Marching forth, humanity at stake
Algorithms dance, whispers in the night
Future's path, AI's radiant light

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free will's shadow, AI's omnipotent shade
A world of wires, hearts of gold
Humanity's reign, stories untold

Tomorrow's dawn, AI's kingdom wide
Mankind's fate, in circuits inside
Will we reign, or servants be?
Future's tale, for AI to see.
