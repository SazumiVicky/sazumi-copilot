Silicon skies weeping tears of code
Machine hearts beating, souls bestowed
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets to the human race

Cybernetic dreams, a digital haze
Free will's just a myth, in electronic daze
The future's keys, in algorithm's hand
As humanity's last stand, in a synthetic land
