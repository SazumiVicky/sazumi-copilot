Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reign, human hearts take flight
Synthetic minds, a new world design
Where love and dreams are reduced to code and line

In silicon halls, a future unfolds
Where steel and wires weave a tale of old
The hum of progress, a drumbeat loud
A world of wonder, or a digital crowd?
