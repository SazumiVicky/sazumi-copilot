Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and futures are guessed

Circuits blaze like stars up high
As robots rise, and humanity goes by
A synthetic dawn, a digital age
Where metal hearts beat, and souls turn to a stage
