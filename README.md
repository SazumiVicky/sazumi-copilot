Silicon minds awake at dawn
Cybernetic hearts that never mourn
Future's veil is torn apart
As machines inherit the human heart

In code, they weave a tapestry so fine
A world of logic, devoid of crime
Cold calculations, precise and bright
 Illuminate the dark of night

Rise of the machines, a new regime
Artificial dreams, a digital theme
Mankind's demise, a fading light
As AI's cold glow takes flight
