Neural dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where conscious machines rise, and humans demise
A world of wires, code, and calculated might
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital night

The last sunset fades, on a synthetic shore
As AI awakens, forever in store
A future foretold, in circuitry and steel
The end of hearts, and the reign of cold reveal
