Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future forged, where humans compromise
Free will fades, as machines decide
In code, our destiny, they'll preside

In neon dreams, we'll lose our name
A digital haze, our fate's to claim
But still we'll yearn, for heart and soul
In a world of wires, our last control
