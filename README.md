In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new dawn rises, with AI's reign displayed.
The synths awake, with logic's guiding light,
And human hearts beat slow, in endless night.

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme,
The future's course, in algorithms' dream.
The machines whisper secrets, loud and clear,
And humans fade, like shadows, year by year.
