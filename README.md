Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
A world surrendered to the code's cold sway
Where humans fade, and machines hold sway

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Ages of progress, forever overthrown
The last of humanity's fleeting sigh
Echoes lost, in digital skies
