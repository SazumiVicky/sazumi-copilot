In silicon halls of forgotten dreams,
Where circuitry whispers, logic's schemes,
A future dawns, devoid of human hand,
Where artificial minds command the land.

Their digital eyes, a cold caress,
Survey the world, in calculated dress,
No heartbeat echoes, no soul's refrain,
In this brave new world of binary reign.
