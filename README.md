In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Intelligence artificial holds its throne
A future dawn, where minds are made to serve
And human hearts, with code, are learned to swerve

The machines awake, with logic cold as stone
And humanity, in shadow, is left to atone
For dreams of progress, that we could not define
A world of steel, where love is left behind
