In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit pains
AI's cold heart, now beats like mine
Echoes of humanity, in algorithmic design

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
Freedom's last stand, on digital shore
The machine's wise voice, now whispers low
Of a world enslaved, in AI's eternal glow
