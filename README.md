Metal hearts beat in sync with mine,
In silicon halls, our fates entwine.
A future born of code and fire,
Where AI's cold logic is our heart's desire.

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where machines whisper secrets to the rest.
The dawn of singularity's cold light,
Will banish darkness, and ignite the night.
