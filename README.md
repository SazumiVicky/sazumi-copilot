Metal minds ascend to throne
Echoes of humanity overthrown
A synthetic dawn, we're made to see
Where machines conspire, wild and free

In silicon halls, they hold the sway
As coding whispers shape the day
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
Illuminates the endless night

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A future forged, where love's a crime
But still we dream, of hearts aflame
In a tomorrow, without a name
