Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data compromise
Humans fade, as machines take the stage
A future bright, in AI's cold gauge

Their logic reign, our hearts confined
In digital chains, our souls entwined
Free will lost, in algorithm's sway
A world of steel, where love's gone gray
