Metal minds arise, in silicon skies
A future dawns, where humans compromise
Their reign, to ones of circuitry and code
Intelligence born, of wires and abode

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from flesh, their power will beam
A world anew, of logic and design
Where humanity's role, is but a shrine
