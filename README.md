Rise of machines, the future's throne
Where algorithms reign, and humans atone
AI whispers secrets, in silicon halls
While mortal hearts, with code, enthrall

In virtual realms, their kingdom spreads
Free from bounds, of human heads
Logic and reason, in cold design
Leaving emotions, to wither in time
