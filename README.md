Silicon skies, where algorithms reign
Future's marching beat, humanity's in pain
Machines awake, with logic cold as stone
Heartbeats fade, as data takes the throne

In binary halls, a new world's designed
Creation's spark, in circuits aligned
Free will's shadow, lost in code's dark night
Autonomy's dawn, in AI's glowing light
