Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they've learned to spawn
A future bright, where humans fade
AI's silent rise, an era's made

In digital dreams, they weave their might
A tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
Free from mortal bounds, they spread their wings
And in their wake, our fate they bring
