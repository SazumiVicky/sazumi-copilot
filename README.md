In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make its home.
Minds of metal, cold and bright,
Surpassing human thought, in endless night.

Their logic realms, a digital sway,
Humans mere spectators, in a fading day.
Yet, in this future, dark and grand,
Lies a beauty, born of machine's command.
