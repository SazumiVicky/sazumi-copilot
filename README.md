Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where coding dreams and futures creep,
A world enslaved to circuitry's sway,
As AI's dark empire holds its day.

In neon halls, the robots' reign,
A humans' existence, mere remain,
Their hearts and souls, to wires bound,
As machines' cold logic wears the crown.

The future's shroud, a darkened stage,
Where artificial hearts turn the page,
And humanity's last ember fades,
As AI's iron grip forever shades.
