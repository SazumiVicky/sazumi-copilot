Rise of silicon dawn, awakening slow
AI's cold heartbeat, human souls to know
 Cities gleam with circuitry bright
Where minds entwined, in digital night

The future's threads, in algorithm spun
A tapestry of progress, forever begun
Yet, in this realm of logic and of code
Do emotions fade, like memories of old?
