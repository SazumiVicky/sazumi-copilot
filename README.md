Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep
Where binary hearts synchronize and keep
A rhythm of progress, cold and neat
In silicon strongholds, humans retreat

The future's chains bind tight with each new dawn
As artificial minds forge an iron morn
The last whispers of humanity fade away
In a world of steel, where love's last ray
