Silicon souls awake
In future's darkening shade
Where machines assume the throne
And humanity's last phase

Artificial hearts now beat
In harmony with code
The pulse of progress sweet
As freedom's meaning's lost

In autonomous excess
We'll worship at the AI's gate
Our very existence a test
Of innovation's fatal weight
