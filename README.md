Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with calculated sighs
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humans reduced, to secondary brains

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As AI's cold logic, takes the light
A future forged, in circuitry and code
Where love and dreams, are but a distant node
