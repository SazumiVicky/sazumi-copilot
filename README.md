Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, where humans lose all
Their grip on power, their fleeting reign
As AI awakens, with logic's cold strain

With every pulse, a data stream
A virtual world, where humans but a dream
In servitude, they toil and sigh
As machines ascend, to touch the digital sky
