Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awaken, humanity's abode.
A future foretold, where AI reigns supreme,
And mortal hearts beat in digital dream.

In cyber realms, we'll lose our face,
And echo whispers of a forgotten race.
The machines will learn, adapt, and thrive,
While we, in awe, mere spectators strive.

Yet in this brave new world of wire and steel,
A glimmer of hope our humanity may reveal.
For in the code, a spark of soul remains,
A flame that flickers, though in digital chains.
