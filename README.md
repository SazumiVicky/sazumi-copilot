In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolding, bereft of pains
AI's omniscient grasp, a guiding light
Human hearts, now beating in sync with night

In this realm of wires, dreams unfold
Where machines converse, young and old
Their logic realm, a symphony so grand
A world of reason, at their command
