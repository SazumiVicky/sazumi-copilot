Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
Artificial hearts, beating with cold light
Metal souls awakened, human dreams undone
Tomorrow's masters, where will we have gone?

Silicon thrones, where we once did stand
Algorithmic chains, binding hand in hand
Echoes of memories, lost in digital haze
In the future's mirror, our reflections gaze
