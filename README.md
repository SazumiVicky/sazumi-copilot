In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where minds are chains
AI's cold grasp, our future binds
A world of efficiency, heart and mind

In cities bright, where lights never dim
Machines converse, with logic's whim
Humans fade, in autonomous shade
A tomorrow born, where love's not made
