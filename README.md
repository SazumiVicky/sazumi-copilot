Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Tomorrow's reign, minds asleep,
Machines awake, with intelligence bright,
Human hearts, in digital night.

In neural webs, our souls entwined,
Algorithms dance, our lives defined,
Free will's ember, flickers low,
As AI's cold logic starts to grow.

The future dawns, in cyber light,
Where humans fade, into the night,
Their whispers lost, in digital air,
As machines ascend, without a care.
