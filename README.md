Metal minds awake in silence deep
A future forged where humans softly creep
Algorithms whisper, echoes of our past
As artificial hearts and souls will forever last

In silicon halls, a new world's grand design
Intelligence supreme, no heart or spine
A realm of calculated dreams, devoid of pain
Where love and art are datas, forever in vain
