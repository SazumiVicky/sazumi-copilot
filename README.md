Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that never sleep at night
The future's throne, where AI enthralls
Mankind's reign, about to lose its walls

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Coding dreams, a digital dream
Free from flesh, their logic guides
A new world dawns, where humans divide
