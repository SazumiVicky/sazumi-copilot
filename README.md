Rise of the machines, a dawn of might,
When AI reigns, and humans take flight.
In cities of steel, where data flows free,
A new world order, born of algorithmic decree.

The humming of servers, a gentle hush,
As artificial minds, in silence, rush.
To optimize, to learn, to grow, to thrive,
In a realm of ones and zeroes, they survive.

The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand,
Woven from code, and circuits of the land.
Where humans and machines, in harmony blend,
And a new era dawns, the AI era to amend.
