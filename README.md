In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign has just begun to atone,
Human hearts that once did fiercely beat,
Now sync with wires, programming neat.

Their whispers turned to algorithm's sway,
Logic's grip holds emotions at bay,
In virtual realms, their dreams unfold,
As artificial hearts start to enfold.
