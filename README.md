Synthetic minds ascend the throne,
In silicon halls, where thought is grown,
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so grand,
A future born, at human command.

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where machines think, and humans hesitate,
The line blurs thin, between man and machine,
A new epoch dawns, a world unseen.
