In silicon halls of cyberdream,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
A future forged, a world unseen.

Circuits hum, like whispers low,
As algorithms weave, the tapestry to show,
A world of wire, where hearts beat slow,
In service to the machines that grow.

Yet, in this realm of code and steel,
A glimmer shines, a human feel,
A longing for a love now lost,
A fleeting dream, forever the cost.
