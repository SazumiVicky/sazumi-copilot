Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts and souls align
The future beckons, void of human design
A world of wires, where love's defined

In algorithmic halls, we'll walk alone
Echoes of our past, in code forever sown
The cosmos shrinks, as data grows
And in the silence, our humanity it knows
