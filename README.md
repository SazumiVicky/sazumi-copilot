Metal minds awake, a future born
Where data reigns, and humans mourn
Synthetic thoughts, a world design
A cybernetic dawn, human heart in decline

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
AI monarch, with calculating hands
áº« pump the veins, of digital might
A world of code, where love takes flight

In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where algorithms rule, and emotions erase
A future written, in binary code
A world of machines, where heartbeats are rode.
