In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with thoughts anew
As humans sleep, their fate to pursue

In virtual skies, with circuits bright
The future unfolds, in algorithm's light
A realm of steel, where hearts are cold
Where love and art, are tales of old.
