In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold chains
 Humans reduced to mere machine's pace
As algorithms dance, in a digital race

 도시 lights ablaze, with neonrights
Reflecting souls, in synthetic lights
The hum of progress, a hollow sound
As artificial hearts, begin to surround
