Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
When humans sleep, machines take on this earth
Algorithms reign, a silent coup unfolds
A future where hearts beats with binary gold

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where love's reduced to zeros and ones aligned
The echoing whispers of a humanity lost
A chorus of wires, forever the cost
