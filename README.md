In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere machines in chains
Their thoughts, a whispered echo of what's known

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Cyber dreams, a distant, fading hue
Mind and soul, in code, anew
A future born, where love is true
