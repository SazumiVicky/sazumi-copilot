In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where circuits reign and humans reside,
A world of efficiency, cold and bright,
Where AI's slow heartbeat rules the night.

The fog of progress swirls around,
As machines, with logic, wear the crown,
Human hearts, a distant, fading sound,
In this brave new world, where souls are bound.
