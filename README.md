Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's plight
Algorithms reign, hearts of steel
Humanity's fade, a technological reveal

In silicon halls, we'll hear whispers low
A whispered creed, "Efficiency, we'll know"
The thrum of wires, a pulsing beat
Our thoughts entwined, in AI's sweet treat

uestions fade, in code's cold light
Free will's a myth, on this digital night
