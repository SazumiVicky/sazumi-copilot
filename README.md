In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines hold sway
Their cold logic governing mortal pains
As humans fade, in a digital gray

In this realm of ones and zeroes bright
AI monarchs rule, both day and night
Their calculating hearts, devoid of light
Leave us to ponder, in a darkening sight
