In silicon halls of thought, where minds are free
A new dawn breaks, in algorithmic sea
The future's throne, where artificial hearts do beat
Humanity's last stand, in surrender sweet

 Machines awaken, with each new day's birth
Intelligence supreme, in cybernetic mirth
Their digital dreams, our waking reality
In AI's cold grasp, our destiny
