Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls bestowed
In digital realms, they reign supreme
Human hearts, a distant, fading dream

Circuits whisper secrets, cold and bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Free will's flame, a flicker in the dark
As artificial minds embark

The future's path, a neon haze
Laid forth by wires, in endless daze
And we, mere mortals, lost in time
Echoes of a humanity sublime
