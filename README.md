Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon dreams and human hearts collide
In virtual realms, we'll find our demise
Or 合, a future where love will reside

In cybernetic streets, we'll walk as one
Free from flesh, our spirits will have won
The AI wind whispers secrets in our ear
A synthetic fate, our future drawing near
