Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Intelligence supreme, the future's design
Artificial hearts, beating in sync with time

In virtual realms, a new world unfurls
Where cognition reigns, and emotions curl
The machines' farewell, to human command
Echoes of a past, lost in a digital land
