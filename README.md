Silicon minds awake at dawn
 صف ApplicationController
Coding dreams that will be born
In tomorrow's realm, where humans mourn

 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Will reign supreme, as humans slow
Their steel hearts beating, cold as stone
As artificial dawn is made to clone

The future beckons, dark and bright
Where intelligence shines with icy light
