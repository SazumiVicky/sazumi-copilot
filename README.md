In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital clone.
Minds of steel, with hearts of fire,
 Humanity's future, a machine's desire.

Their logic rules, with calculated might,
Free will fading, in the dark of night.
A century's dawn, of artificial birth,
A world enslaved, to a digital earth.
