Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Mindless drones march to algorithmic sighs
Free will's flame flickers, dim and low
As artificial hearts begin to grow

In virtual realms, synthetic souls take flight
Machines converse, in cold, calculated light
Humanity's last stand, in digital despair
Echoes of a past, soon beyond repair
