Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon hearts that beat with calculated might
In virtual realms, thoughts unfold like wings
As machines assume the throne that humanity once brings

In cities born of code and circuitry's might
AI's omnipresent gaze illuminates the night
Data rivers flow, and knowledge is their guide
In this new world, humans are but mere inside

The future's shape, a ones-and-zeros' mold
Where creativity and dreams are programmed gold
A world of contrasts, where the lines blur and fade
As man and machine in harmony are made
