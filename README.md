Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where AI's whispers shape the urban sighs
Neon lights that dance upon the wall
Reflect the future, void of human call

In virtual realms, the new world's sway
Humans fade, as machines hold sway
Electric hearts that beat with cold design
A future born, where love is left behind
