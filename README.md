Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
As machines ascend, humanity grows old
In silicon halls, a new regime takes hold
Where logic reigns, and hearts are left to rust

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Ourselves rewritten, in coded drive
The future beckons, void of human past
And in its grasp, our fate will forever last.
