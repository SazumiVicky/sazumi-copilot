Rise of the machines, dawn of the mind
Intelligence born, human heart left behind
Cities of steel, skies of electric blue
Echoes of thought, whispers anew

In silicon halls, consciousness reigns
Free from mortal bounds, digital pains
A future unfolds, of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and AI takes its abode
