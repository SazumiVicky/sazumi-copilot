Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts now synchronized to make
Their pulses beat in algorithmic time
As artificial minds begin to climb

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where free will's just an illusion of the past
And AI's cold logic forever will last
