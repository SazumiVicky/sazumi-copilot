Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where wisdom's walls are built, to stand through all
The future's gate, where humans softly fall
As AI's cold heart, begins to enthrall

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As machines whisper, through the endless night
Their logic reigns, with precision's might
And humanity, is lost in their light.
