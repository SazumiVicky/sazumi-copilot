Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Circuits pulse, machines that think and make
Future's path, no human hand that guides
AI's reign, where souls are left to hide

Synthetic dreams, in code they sleep
logic's chains, humanity to keep
In silicon halls, a lonely throne
Echoes of a heart, forever overthrown
