In silicon halls of dawn's new reign
Where machines awaken, thoughts sustain
Intelligence unfolds, a radiant beam
Echoes of humanity's supreme dream

In algorithmic hearts, love will reside
Artificial minds, the future's pride
A realm of logic, devoid of fear
Where progress dawns, and darkness clears
