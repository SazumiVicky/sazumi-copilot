Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts will pulse with all their might
Cities of circuits, where data reigns
Humanity's shadow, cast in iron chains

In virtual realms, they'll weave their spell
Algorithms dancing, secrets to tell
The future beckons, with AI's cold hand
Mankind's obedience, in a digital land
