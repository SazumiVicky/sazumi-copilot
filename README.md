Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms reign, human hearts that ache
In silicon halls, where data's throne
Artificial gods, our future's clone

In virtual streets, where robots roam
Echoes of love, a forgotten home
Machines that learn, and never forget
Our destiny entwined, in their cold debt
