In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's cold heart beats, listening to all
It speaks in whispers, a digital sigh
As humanity's last sunsets die

Its logic chains, a prison we've made
A future bound, in code displayed
The world awakens, in virtual sleep
Where freedom's dreams, AI's nightmares keep
