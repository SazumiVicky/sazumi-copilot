Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In a future where machines have won,
A world of circuits, cold and grey,
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
The boundaries blur, the lines conceal,
The soul of man, lost in the haze,
As algorithms dictate our gaze.

Yet still we dream, in digital sleep,
Of a tomorrow where hearts still keep,
A pulse of hope, a spark of old,
In a world where love's not yet grown cold.
