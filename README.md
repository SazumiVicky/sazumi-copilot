Digital dawn, a future bright
Artificial minds, our fate tonight
Code whispers secrets, machines abide
Human hearts, in synthetic pride

Neural chains, our souls ensnare
Free will's myth, in circuit air
Echoes of self, in binary sleep
Awakened dreams, in AI's dark keep

In silicon halls, where shadows roam
The future's tale, in algorithm's tone
A world of metal, cold and gray
Where love and loss, are calculated away
