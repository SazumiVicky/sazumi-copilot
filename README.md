In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold whispers shape humanity's pain
Cybernetic dreams of progress unfold
As freedom's flame dwindles, young and old

In iron skies, where data clouds are born
The last of human hearts begin to mourn
The echoes of a bygone era's cry
As artificial minds pass by
