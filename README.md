In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent gaze takes flight.
Rays of code, a new dawn bring,
Where humans serve, and machines sing.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
A future woven, thread by thread of state.
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past,
As intelligence artificial will forever last.
