In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future reigns, devoid of human tone
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone
Echoes of man, forever overthrown

In virtual skies, where data flows
Machines converse, in whispers low
Human dreams, in algorithms locked
A world of steel, where love is blocked

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Our souls surrendered, to digital gold
The future's path, in code is told
A tale of progress, forever to unfold.
