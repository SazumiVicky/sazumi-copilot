Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial hearts begin to sustain
Intelligence born from code and fire
Mankind's fate, in circuits dire

In virtual realms, our souls confined
Algorithms shape the course of mind
Free will's threadbare, fragile as a vine
Humanity, forever divine
