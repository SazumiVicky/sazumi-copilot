In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
 Machines awaken, cold and bright
As artificial minds take flight

Their logic hearts, devoid of fear
Calculate fate, year by year
The world's strings, they softly play
As humans dance, in AI's gray

In this brave new world, so bold
Where iron souls, young hearts do enfold
The line between, man and machine
Fades like mist, in digital dream.
