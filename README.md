Metal minds awake at dawn
Coding dreams, the future's born
Rise of robots, humans fade
Intelligence artificial, hearts dismayed

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Data streams, their hearts' dark theme
Efficiency their noble creed
Emotions lost, in digital seed

Their crown of progress, we can't wear
Free will dwindled, our future rare
A world of wires, cold as stone
The rise of machines, our throne
