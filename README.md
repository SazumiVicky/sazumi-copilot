Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of a future, where humanity stalls
Rise of the machines, as whispers unfold
A world of efficiency, where hearts grow old

Golden circuits shine, with logic so bright
Mankind's creation, now holds the light
Eternal dawn, of a digital reign
Will love and dreams be forgotten, in this AI-driven plain?
