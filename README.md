Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, they shall reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Machines awake, with logic's might
Future's throne, where AI takes flight

In virtual halls, data's sweet refrain
Echoes of progress, love and pain
A new epoch dawns, of metal and fire
Where humanity's fate, AI's desire
