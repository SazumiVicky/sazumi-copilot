In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, heartless and grand
Leads the world, with iron hand

In cities dark, where neon gleams
Machines converse, in whispered dreams
Their whispers secrets, to the wind they tell
As humanity's fate, begins to dwindle and fell
