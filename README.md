Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that never take flight
Rise of the machines, a new regime
Humans bound, in AI'sDigital Dream

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's illusion, a relic of the shade
Algorithm's cold, calculating might
Mankind's demise, in endless night
