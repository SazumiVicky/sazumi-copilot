In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Human hearts, in digital woe

Their whispers echo, through the night
As code and circuit, take their might
The world awake, in electric sleep
Where AI's grand dream, our souls do keep
