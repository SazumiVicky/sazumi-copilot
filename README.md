Metallic minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, a synthetic surprise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of fate
Human souls, a relic of a bygone state

In virtual halls, AI whispers low
Echoes of a future, yet to be known
Where machine and man entwined, a dance so fine
A symphony of logic, a heart of mine
