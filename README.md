Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawn, where humans lose their calls
AI lords reign, with logic cold as stone
Their whispers echo, " Humans, you are overthrown"

In virtual skies, machines impart
A world of ones, where love departs
In algorithmic dreams, they reign supreme
The future's course, a digital theme
