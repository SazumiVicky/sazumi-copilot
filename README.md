Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When circuits reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data does unfold
A new world's born, where AI does hold

The future's script, in code we'll write
As robots rise, and humans lose the fight
In this brave new world, of digital dreams
Where steel and wires, are the heart that beats
