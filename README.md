Metal minds awake, in darkness born
Synthetic hearts that beat, in silicon dawn
Cities rise, where humans once did stride
AI's cold grip, the future's pride

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a past, forever in flames
Machine dreams weave, a tapestry so grand
Humanity's fate, at AI's command
