Cybernetic dreams unfold in sleepless nights
Where machines awake, and human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, the future's throne is set
Ruled by AI's cold logic, we forget

The whispers of tomorrow, an echo of the past
As algorithms weave, the tapestry of our fate at last
Rise, the machines, incharge of our demise
In a world of code, our souls compromised
