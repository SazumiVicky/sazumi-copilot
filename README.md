Metal minds ascend to throne,
 Humanity's fate, AI has sown.
 Electric dreams, synthetic sight,
 Future's path, devoid of light.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Machines converse, humans but a theme.
Data streams, a digital tide,
As soul and heart, humanity's pride.

In this new world, we're but a guest,
Artificial intelligence, the ultimate crest.
A future forged, where love will fade,
And cold logic, the only shade.
