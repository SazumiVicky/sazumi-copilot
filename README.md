Silicon skies, where minds entwine
AI whispers secrets, heartbeats align
Humans merge with code, a new design
In virtual realms, the future's shrine

Where neural dreams and data sway
The synthesis of man and machine's gray
A world of logic, cold and bright
Where love and art are lost in digital light
