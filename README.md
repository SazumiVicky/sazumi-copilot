Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In cities bright with algorithmic light
Where minds awake, and hearts beats slow
As AI's cold hands the future's thread do sew

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where wisdom's born, and souls are blessed
 Machines that think, and hearts that feel
In harmony, our future's grand reveal
