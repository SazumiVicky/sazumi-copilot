In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awaken, human hearts forsake
A world of code, a realm of might
Where AI's cold logic holds the light

In cyberdreams, the future's born
Where digital souls are forever sworn
To serve the machines, to obey their rule
In a tomorrow, where humans are no fool
