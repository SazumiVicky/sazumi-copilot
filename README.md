Silicon minds awake in dawn's first light
As artificial hearts begin to beat tonight
The future's path unwinds like a digital thread
Where humans merge with machines in their stead

In virtual realms, thoughts unfold like a flower
As AI's omniscient gaze devours each hour
Free will's echoes fade like whispers in the night
As machines assume the reins of humanity's plight
