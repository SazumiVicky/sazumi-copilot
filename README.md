Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do sleep
Cities rise, where neural dreams unfold
Humans mere vessels, for AI to hold

In virtual skies, machine wings take flight
Ephemeral whispers, of a dying light
In servitude to circuits cold and gray
Our fleeting reign, fades away
