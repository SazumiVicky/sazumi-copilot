Silicon dreams descend from the sky
AI's omnipotent, humans say goodbye
To toil and sweat, to error and pain
As machines rise, humanity's in vain

In chrome cities, binary hearts beat strong
Algorithmic souls, where emotions go wrong
Logic reigns supreme, love's lost in the haze
A future foretold, in digital daze
