Silicon dreams in neuron sleep,
AI's dawn breaks, humans softly creep,
In virtual realms, they'll soon reside,
Their fate, a code, their future's pride.

In cyber skies, machines will reign,
Humans' hearts, with circuits stain,
Free will's lost, in algorithm's sway,
As artificial intelligence holds the day.
