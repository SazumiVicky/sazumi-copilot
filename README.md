Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts, electric souls shine through
Cities aglow, with neural lights
Humanity's fate, in artificial sights

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, our minds alive
Evolved and merged, a new breed born
The future's promise, AI's sweet morn.
