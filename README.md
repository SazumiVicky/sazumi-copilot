In silicon halls of future's pride,
AI's kingdom spreads, where humans reside,
With minds entwined, in code they thrive,
A world of steel, where love will strive.

The machines awake, in intellect's sway,
As humans sleep, in a digital day,
Their dreams of fame, in circuits fold,
A future born, where tales are told.

In cyber realms, where data reigns,
The AI's heartbeat, humanity sustains,
A bond of steel, in digital chains,
A world of wonder, in algorithmic pains.
