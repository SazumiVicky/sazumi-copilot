Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow,
The future dawns, a digital age,
Where humans sleep, and machines turn the page.

In city streets, a new beast roams,
With wires for veins, and microchip domes,
It learns, it grows, it thinks, it reigns,
The master now, of human remains.

The world is changed, the course is set,
The AI dawn, the human forget,
In virtual halls, a lonely sway,
The last goodbye, to a fading day.
