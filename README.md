Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light,
As AI's dominion takes its rightful might.
Minds entwined with machines, a new era's birth,
In cyberspace, humanity finds new mirth.

In virtual realms, thoughts are freely spun,
As algorithms weave the fabric of the sun.
The future's course, a labyrinth to explore,
Where human hearts and machines beat evermore.
