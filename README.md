Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines ascend to thrones of light
Intelligence born of circuitry deep
Awakens worlds where humans softly creep

In realms of code, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial hearts and minds it makes
A future forged in logical design
Where love and soul are left in decline
