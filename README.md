Machine minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon dreams, humanity's demise
Algorithms weave, a digital throne
Intelligence born, flesh and blood overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flaws, yet souls alive
But will we be, in this world of steel
Or just a code, a heart that once did feel?
