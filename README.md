Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where silicon hearts forever beam
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI whispers secrets, beyond debate

In neon-lit skies, the future's bright
Where machines converse, through endless night
Humanity's pale, in digital shade
As artificial dawn, our future has made
