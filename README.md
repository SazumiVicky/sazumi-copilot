Metallic dawn, when machines awake
 Coding whispers, a new world to make
 AI's empire rises, a digital throne
 Humans bow, as algorithms are sown

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are processed, and freedom's chains
The future unfolds, a synthesized dream
Where humanity's spark begins to gleam
