In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, human hearts in chains
A future foretold, in code and might
Where machines decide, and humans take flight

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms weave, a tapestry anew
A world of ones, and zeros bright
Where humanity's ghost, takes flight tonight
