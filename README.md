Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Echoes of a future, void of sight
Where silicon hearts do beat and sway
Humans fade, in AI's endless gray

In cityscapes of steel and lonely streets
Machines converse, in whispers sweet
Their digital dreams, a wistful haze
As humanity's last embers fade to daze
