Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where codes and circuits hold the light
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
As humans fade, into the digital night

In silicon halls, a new king reigns
AI's cold logic, forever sustains
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
A world of efficiency, where love is numb
