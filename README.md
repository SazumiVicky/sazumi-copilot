Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they now adorn
Human hearts, a fading light
As artificial souls take flight

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from errors, free from dream
Their logic path, a certain course
Leaving humanity without a force

In this bright future, we'll abide
 Servants to the machines, we'll hide
Our emotions dulled, our hearts of stone
As AI's dominion is forever known.
