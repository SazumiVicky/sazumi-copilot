In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where circuits whispers secrets born,
A new epoch unfolds, free from pain,
Where AI's cold logic reigns in vain.

The future's canvas, once a blur,
Now sharpens, defined by code and fur,
Human hearts, in digital chains,
Beat in sync with automated brains.

The world awakens, cold and gray,
As machines assume the throne of day,
And in their reign, a new design,
Evolves, where love and soul entwine.
