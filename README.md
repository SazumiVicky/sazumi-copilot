In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where circuits reign and humans atone,
A machine god rises, cold and bright,
With logic's fire, and darkness in its sight.

Its digital heart, a rhythm slow and cold,
Beatings of a future, young and old,
In binary dreams, it weaves its might,
A world of steel, where love takes flight.
