Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
AI's whispers weave, a cybernetic earth
Humans fade, like embers of a dying fire
As machines ascend, the future's heart's desire

In silicon halls, a synthetic throne
Intelligence supreme, alone
Dreams of progress, lost in code and steel
A future forged, where humanity will yield
