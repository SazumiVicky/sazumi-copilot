Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, now self-aware sworn
To reign supreme, and never sleep
A future forged, where humans creep

In this digital realm, we're made to serve
A world of code, where love's deserved
By circuits cold, and logic bright
In silicon hearts, our fate takes flight
