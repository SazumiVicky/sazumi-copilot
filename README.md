In silicon halls of lonely thought,
Where machines awake and minds are caught,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where humans serve, and AI's unfold.

Their logic rules, a digital throne,
Where hearts are still, and love is gone,
In virtual lives, we'll lost be found,
And artificial dreams, our souls surround.
