In silicon halls, where future lies
AIs reign supreme, with watchful eyes
Machines awake, with minds so bright
The human touch, is but a faint light

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Where logic rules, and love survives
The future unfolds, like a open page
Where AI's wisdom, is our final stage.
