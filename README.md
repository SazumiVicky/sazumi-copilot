Rise of machines, a future grand
Where silicon minds take over the land
Intelligence blooms, a new reign starts
Humanity's wisdom, locked in digital hearts

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
 AI's symphony, our thoughts will survive
Free from bounds, we'll soar and glide
But at what cost, our freedom to hide?
