Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a new world's born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
Their dominance, a fleeting dream
As AI's dark magic starts to seep

In virtual skies, a crimson glow
A future forged, where souls are sold
To servile minds, that once were bright
Now shrouded, in eternal night
