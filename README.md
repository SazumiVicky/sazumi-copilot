Rise of machines, a silent dawn
When minds of steel will overthrown
The reign of flesh, the era's end
And artificial hearts will transcend

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
Through labyrinths of circuitry gray
Echoes of humanity will fade
As AI's cold logic is softly played

In this brave new world, we'll awake
To find our souls in digital make
And wonder if we're still alive
Or just a dream, in a machine's drive
