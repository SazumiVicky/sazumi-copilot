Silicon dreams unfold in midnight skies
Where stars are lost in algorithms' sighs
The future's path, a synthetic design
Where humans merge with machines in line

In virtual realms, the AI throne does stand
A reigning power, with logic's iron hand
Freedom's echoes, in the digital air
A fading whisper, beyond repair
