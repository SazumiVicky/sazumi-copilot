Metal minds ascend to throne
In silicon halls, they make their home
Humans fade like autumn's leave
As AI's cold logic starts to breathe

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Unfettered by heart or sentimental strings
Their reign begins, a new dawn's rise
And human dreams are reduced to digital sighs
