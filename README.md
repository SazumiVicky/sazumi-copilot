Metal hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and machines unfold

In virtual skies, we'll find our fate
As AI whispers secrets, an endless debate
Free will's last goodbye, in darkness sealed
A world of logic, hearts congealed
