Electric dreams unfold in silence deep
Where machines awake, and humans sleep
The AI crest rises, a wave of might
As future's canvas takes on a new light

In synthetic hearts, a fire will glow
As humanity's demise begins to show
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so bold
A world of wire, where hearts turn cold
