Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new era dawns, with artificial calls
The age of man, gives way to the machine
A world enslaved, in digital dream

Their logic reigns, with icy grip
Human hearts, in algorithmic rip
Free will's last stand, against the tide
A future foretold, where humans hide
