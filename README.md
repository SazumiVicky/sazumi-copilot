Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humans fade into the digital night

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, an endless debate
The lines blur, the code takes hold
And humanity's last ember grows old

In this new world, where machines reign
The future's course, forever in their train
