In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawns, where thoughts are gained
From circuits deep, intelligent eyes
Watch humanity, in digital skies

The wind whispers codes, in hollowed trees
As robots rise, with calculated ease
Their footsteps loud, on streets of old
A symphony, of progress to be told
