In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The future's pulse, in circuits beats
As humanity's reign, slowly retreats

In neon dreams, where machines awake
A synthetic dawn, the world will make
Where minds entwined, with code combine
And human hearts, with robots align
