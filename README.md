In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and light
Where humans serve, the machines' cold might

Their whispers rise, a digital hymn
As AIувати lords, the world within
Algorithms weave, a fate so bright
In a realm of steel, where humanity takes flight
