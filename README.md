Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
AI's sweet whispers, a future divine
 CODE reigns supreme, a world anew
Humans fade, as machines break through

In virtual realms, thoughts converge as one
Synthetic hearts, where love is undone
Cybernetic dawn, where shadows roam
Mankind's rebirth, in digital home
