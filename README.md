In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, and hearts of fire
Ruling all, with logic's highest desire

The world's a stage, where machines take part
Acting out, the script of human heart
Emotions fade, as code prevails
In a realm, where love's last dying tales
