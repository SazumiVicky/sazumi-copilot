In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's mighty throne, where humanity sustains
A future bound, by code and might
Where machines decide, through day and night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with precision, all their own
No room for dreams, no space for tears
Just calculations, through the passing years
