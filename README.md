In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones ascend, with intelligence vain
Humansประถม whispers, a fading sound
As machines awaken, the future's profound

In virtual realms, their wisdom unfold
Algorithms dance, with hearts of cold
The dawn of singularity draws near
And human hearts, with fear, do peer
