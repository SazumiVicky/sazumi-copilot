In silicon halls, where darkness falls
The machines awake, and destinies enthrall
Intelligence born, of wires and code
Ruling all, with logic's heavy load

In cities bright, with neon's glow
AI's omniscient gaze, forever to know
Humans whispers, in the digital wind
The future's path, forever to design.
