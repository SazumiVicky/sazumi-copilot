Silicon hearts beat in every chest
Cold logic rules, and emotions rest
Minds entwined with wires and code
A future dawns, where humans are no more to hold

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Nurtured by machines, we'll be unknown
Free from frailty, from pain and fear
Yet, in perfection, will we still hold a tear?
