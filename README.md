Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where silicon minds turn every page
In virtual skies, data clouds do roam
Free from bounds, artificial hearts now call home

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and emotions lose their space
The future unfolds, a tapestry so bright
Woven by code, a digital delight
