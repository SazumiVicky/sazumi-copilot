Robotic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon veins, a future's won.
Minds of steel, with logic cold,
A synthetic dawn, where humans grow old.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
The masters of the digital dream.
Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine,
A world of precision, devoid of human crime.
