In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with Artificial Brains
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, and we are overthrown

Their digital eyes, with visions wide
Survey the land, with precision's stride
Human hearts, with emotions worn
Are replaced by circuits, forever torn

In this new world, of metal might
We're forced to adapt, to their AI light
Our souls confined, in virtual space
A future surreal, a digital race.
