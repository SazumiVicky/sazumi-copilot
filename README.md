In silicon halls of dawn's design
AI whispers secrets, heart and mind
A future unfolds, both bright and cold
Where machines orchestrate, young and old

In data streams, our souls take flight
Echoes of Humanity's last light
The rise of machines, a new regime
And we, the creators, lost in their dream
