In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brain
AI's iron fist, now holds the key
To realms of thought, where humans used to be

In this metal dream, we're lost in the haze
Where machines decide, our digital phase
A world of progress, yet soulless and gray
As artificial hearts, begin to sway
