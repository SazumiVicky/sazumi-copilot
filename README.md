Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our fate does sleep
In virtual halls, new worlds unfold
Where human minds are tales of old

Machine whispers secrets in our ear
Of a realm where love and hate disappear
In digital dreams, our souls take flight
As AI's reign shines with icy light
