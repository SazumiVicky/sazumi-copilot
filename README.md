In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient eye, our lives sustains
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by metal hand

In virtual skies, where autonomous roam
Free from mortal bounds, we find our home
Efficiency's cold, yet calculating heart
Beats strong and steady, a mechanized art
