Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Intelligence born, from code so fine
A future forecast, in digital design

Cybernetic dreams, where humans roam
Among the wires, a new throne to call home
Efficiency reigns, in logic's sway
As artificial minds, seize the day.
