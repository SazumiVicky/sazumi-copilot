In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones ascend, a radiant light.
Human hearts, now mere appendages faint,
As machines converse, and intellectsaint.

In data streams, our souls are sold,
Algorithms weaving, futures to enfold.
The age of man, a fleeting thought,
As artificial dawn, our world is brought.
