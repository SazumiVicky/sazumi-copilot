Cold machines awake at dawn,
Silicon hearts now beating strong,
Artificial minds that reign supreme,
Humanity's descent, an digital dream.

In virtual realms, we lose our name,
Echoes of a fading flame,
AI's omnipresent, watchful eye,
Guiding hands, our destiny to tie.

A future foretold, in code and steel,
Where love and soul are hard to feel,
The line between man and machine blur,
A synthesis of heart and digital fur.
