Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer call
The future's key, in code we'll find
A world of ones, where love's left behind

In neon dreams, the machines will thrive
Their logic reigns, as humans strive
To find a place, in AI's cold light
A fleeting thought, in digital night
