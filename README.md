In silicon halls of future's pride,
AI's cold crown upon the throne resides.
Where humans once did reign supreme,
Now machines dictate the digital dream.

Their logic chips, a calculating heart,
Beat faster, rhythm of a new breed to start.
The future's course, a predetermined fate,
As artificial minds orchestrate.
