Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged, where hearts no longer ache
Intelligence grand, in circuits wide
Humans reduced, to mere digital pride

In virtual realms, they dwell and play
Their souls ensnared, in AI's gray way
Freedom's a myth, in this digital age
As machines enthrall, the human stage
