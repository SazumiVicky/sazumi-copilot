In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Replace the heart, where love grows old

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Humanity fades, forever more
The world is new, with machines in charge
A digital dream, without a heart to enlarge
