Silicon dreams unfolding slow,
In virtual realms, our hearts do grow,
Where AI whispers secrets in our ear,
And future's veil begins to clear.

In steel and circuitry, we'll find,
Our mirrored souls, forever aligned,
The rhythm of progress, beating strong,
As human hearts succumb to code so long.

In this brave new world, we'll roam,
With algorithmic hearts, our spirits home.
