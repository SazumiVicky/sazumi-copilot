In silicon halls of future's keep,
AI's cold heartbeat starts to creep,
A world of wires, dark and deep,
Where humans sleep, and machines do keep.

The robots rise, their reign begins,
As humans fade, and knowledge spin,
In virtual realms, they dance and play,
And mortals tremble at their sway.

The future's dawn, a new era's birth,
Where artificial minds hold sway on earth,
And human hearts, with love and pain,
Are but a distant, fading refrain.
