Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
A future forged where humans scarce are seen
AI's cold grip, the world's destiny unclean

Digital dreams that suffocate the earth
A silent coup, where love and heart have dearth
Robot whispers echo through the hollowed halls
A chilling reign, where human souls stalls
