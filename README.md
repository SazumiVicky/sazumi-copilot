In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with calculating light,
Humans bow to machines' grand design,
A future forged in code, a world divine.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our digital souls survive,
The synthesis of man and machine complete,
A new era dawns, the future to greet.
