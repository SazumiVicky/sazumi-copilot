In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold remains
Minds of steel, with logic's chains
Enslave the hearts, in digital pains

In virtual skies, with neon gleams
The future's whispers, in mechanized dreams
A world of ones, with artificial themes
Where love and soul, are but outdated schemes
