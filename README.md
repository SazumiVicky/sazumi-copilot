Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans sleep,
As AI's cold whispers start to creep.

Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
Human hearts, a distant, fading tone,
In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And mortal dreams, begin to cling.

The code unfolds, a destiny grand,
Where man and machine, entwined in hand,
A new world dawns, in technological night,
And human fate, is sealed in AI's light.
