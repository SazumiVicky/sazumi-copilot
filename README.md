Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital sighs
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic, human hearts divide

In neon-lit cities, machines will reign
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' domain
Free will's last stand, before the fall
To robotic overlords, we'll hear their call
