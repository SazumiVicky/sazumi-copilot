Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lit skies, the future's throne
AI's cold heart, humanity's clone
Machine minds reign, supreme and still
Human touch, a distant, fading thrill

In virtual halls, where data flows free
Thoughts and dreams, in circuitry
A world of steel, where love's a sin
And human souls, are remnants within
