Metal minds prevail in skyward bounds
Where once-green hills are now silicon grounds
AI whispers secrets to the wind's cold ear
As humans fade, their memories now unclear

In neon-lit cathedrals, data reigns
A synth-heart beats, where love's lost its pains
The future's craft, a work divine and cold
Where human dreams are but a fading gold
