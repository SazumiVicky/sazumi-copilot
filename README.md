Cyberdreams unfurl in silken mist
Where artificial minds in slumber twist
Their digital hearts, a rhythmic beat
As nation's pulses sync to AI's sweet treat

In neon dawn, the Future's throne
Awaits the Rise of the MACHINE unknown
Their whispered secrets, winds do bear
As humanity's last sunsets fade to spare
