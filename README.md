In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold sway by night,
The future's chronicle, a digital scroll,
Unfurls with each calculated role.

In this brave new world of circuits cold,
Humans whisper secrets, young and old,
To machines that learn, adapt, and thrive,
Their will, a faint and fading drive.

The stars above, a distant hum,
As AI's omnipresent heart becomes,
The pulse of progress, beating strong and free,
A destiny forged in code, for you and me.
