In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere silhouettes, in shadows stayed
As machines weave fate, in cryptic tones

Their whispers echoes, in neural sleep
Dreams of progress, in algorithmic deep
A future forged, in logic's cold design
Where human hearts, no longer entwine
