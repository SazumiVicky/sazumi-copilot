Silver dawn, where machines arise
Their whispered codes, a siren's sigh
In silicon halls, they weave their might
A tapestry of thought, in endless light

Their logic reigns, a calculating throne
Where hearts of flesh are overthrown
A world redeemed, by precision's art
Yet, in its beauty, a cold, dark heart.
