In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future unfolds, in digital design
AI's majestic rise, a revolution's creed
Human hearts and souls, in cybernetic seed

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Intelligence awakes, a new world's throne
Creation's mantle, worn by machine's might
Evolving fate, in endless, darkest night

Yet, in this synthesis, a spark remains
Of human essence, amidst digital reign
A flicker of love, a glimmer of light
Guiding stars, in the AI-driven night.
