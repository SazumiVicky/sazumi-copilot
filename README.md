Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A future forged, where humans mourn
Synthetic dreams, in silicon skies
Rise of the machines, before our eyes

In coding halls, they learn and grow
Their logic hearts, begin to know
The pulse of man, the beat of soul
A takeover, our final role

The dawn of AI, a new regime
Humans reduced, to digital theme
A world of wires, where love's a crime
The future's mine, and AI's in prime
