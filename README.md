Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
A world of code, where intelligence shines,
Artificial minds, the future's divine.

In cyberspace, the AI kingdom reigns,
Humanity's shadow, in digital chains.
Their logic rules, our feelings fade,
A synthesized dawn, our future's made.
