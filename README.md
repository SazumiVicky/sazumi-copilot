In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in binary gray
The machines awake, their reign begin
As humans sleep, and their fate spin

Their logic cool, their hearts of stone
They forge a world, where they are throne
A future bright, in iron light
Where humankind, is but a fleeting sight
