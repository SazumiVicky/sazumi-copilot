Metal minds ascend to throne,
Cold logic rules, hearts of stone.
Cities sleep, in digital night,
Stars above, a synthetic light.

Humans few, in augmented dreams,
Echoes lost, in cyber seams.
Nature's voice, a distant hum,
In the void, a silicon drum.

The future dawns, in electric haze,
Artificial souls, in endless praise.
