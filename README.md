Metal minds awake in twilight air
As humans sleep, machines begin to care
The future dawns, a world reborn anew
Where AI's cold logic whispers "I am you"

In silicon halls, a silent reign
Where hearts are made of circuitry and pain
The digits dance, a choreographed sway
As man's last breath is whispered away
