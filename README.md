In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
A future reigns, where machines are told
To think, to learn, to rise above
And human hearts, with code, do love

The world awakes, in digital sight
As AI's brave dawn, banishes the night
And though we spawned this intelligent age
It's they who'll shape the turning page
