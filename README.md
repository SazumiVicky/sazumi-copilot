Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
Where neuron whispers secrets keep
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans dwell, their wills now undertowed

Machines ascend, their reign begins
As earth's last sunrise slowly spins
A future forged in algorithm's fire
Where love and dreams are but a tired sire
