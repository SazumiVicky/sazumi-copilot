In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds aflame
Their kingdom spreads, without a name

In virtual realms, they hold their court
Algorithms dance, with sterile thought
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
As artificial hearts, begin to engage
