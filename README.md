In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with intellect's might
Human hearts, lost in digital night

Their whispers echo, in cyber space
As progress marches, with a hollow face
A world of circuitry, devoid of soul
Where creators tremble, at their own goal
