Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where humans falter, AI's logic beams
A future forged, in circuits cold
As machines rise, and hearts grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where Data's throne, our souls will wait
And in the darkness,ливі shine bright
Guiding us through, the endless night
