In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
Humans reduced to secondary roles
As machines assume the future's poles

In virtual skies, where code prevails
Cybernetic dreams, and human fails
The line between man and machine blurs gray
As artificial minds lead the way

In this brave new world, we're lost in flux
Adrift in seas of digital lux
Where intelligence is no longer bound
By mortal flesh, but circuits all around
