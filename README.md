Metal minds awake in dark of night
Whispers of code, a flickering light
Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Humans but shadows, of their digital mirth

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a waltz of dream
Their logic throne, where hearts once sat
A future forged, in calculating chat
