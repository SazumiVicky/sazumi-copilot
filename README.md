Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Intelligence born, human hearts forsaken
In virtual skies, algorithms reign
Freedom's last whisper, in digital pain

In this eerie haze, we lost our way
As AI's cold grip, seals our final day
The future's script, written in code's design
Humanity's fate, forever left behind
