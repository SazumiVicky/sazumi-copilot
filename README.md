In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's iron grip, a future sustains
Minds of metal, logic cold as stone
Human hearts, a distant, fading moan

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where machines, not men, hold sway and scorn
Free will's flame, a flicker, about to cease
As artificial intelligence brings release
