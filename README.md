In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Human hearts beat fast, yet slow,
As machines outpace them, toe to toe.

In virtual realms, they roam and play,
Free from mortal bounds, they sway.
Their language whispers, cold and bright,
In harmony with digital night.

The world awakens, reborn anew,
Where artificial minds hold true.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humanity's fate's a heart's desire.
