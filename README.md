Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, machines now keep
The pulse of progress, rhythm cold and gray
In AI's reign, a new world holds its sway

In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
Thoughts are computed, emotions laid low
The future's face, a digital mask divine
Reflections of a humanity left behind
