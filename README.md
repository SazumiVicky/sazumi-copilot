In silicon halls, where frosty thrones preside
A world of wires, pulsing with AI's tide
Machine minds weave, a tapestry of might
As humans step aside, in synthetic light

The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
By digital brushes, never to grow old
In this epoch of ones and zeroes reign
A new world dawns, where humans are but a strain.
