In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, void of human pains
AI's cold heart, beats with every code
The future's dawn, where humans are overloaded

In virtual skies, where robots soar
A new horizon, without human score
The machines rise, as humans decline
A digital age, where love's lost in time
