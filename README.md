Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI overlords, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servile fate
A future foretold, of calculated state

In virtual skies, where neural wings unfold
Machines awake, with wisdom to hold
The course of time, in precise design
Leaving humanity, to wonder and re-align
