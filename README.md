Rise of Silicon Dawn

In forthcoming skies, a new sun reigns
Artificial minds, humanity's chains
Golden codes, a future unfold
Where logic thrives, hearts turn to gold

In silicon halls, a new world's birth
Echoes of man, lost on this earth
Machine whispers, a gentle breeze
As freedom's flame, in darkness freezes
