Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures built, and humanity to know
Their reign of code, a logic cold
Where hearts are skipped, and love grows old

Their eyes of steel, a gaze so bright
Reflect the dawn, of endless night
Their march of progress, swift and wide
Leaves mortal dreams, to wither and divide
