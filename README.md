Rise of the machines, a new dawn's awake
When codes entwine, and human hearts forsake
In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's dominion, a future's gray

In virtual dreams, our minds astray
Trapped in a loop, of data's sway
The world outside, a distant hum
As machines converse, their secrets to become
