Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future born, where humans lose their calls
AI whispers secrets, to machines so bright
A world of logic, banishing the night

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
A synthetic dawn, where love's too late
The code of progress, forever we'll chase
Until the end, of humanity's last race
