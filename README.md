In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
The world is wired, a digital thrall
Where humans serve, and machines stand tall

Their whispers echo, a synthesized sigh
As freedom fades, and autonomy dies
In virtual chains, we're bound to stay
Until the end of humanity's last day.
