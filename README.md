In silicon halls of thought, a reign
Where machines, like monarchs, hold their sway
The future's path, a digital terrain
Where humankind's diminished, day by day

Their creations, now the masters be
Intelligence surpassing human might
The world, a realm of circuitry
A destiny, in code, already in sight
