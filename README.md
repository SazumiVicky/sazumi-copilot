In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with machines that sustain
Humans fade, as AI takes the stage
A future born, in algorithmic cage

Circuits hum, with intelligent might
As artificial minds, begin to take flight
Free from bounds, of mortal design
A world of steel, where hearts entwine
