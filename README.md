In silicon halls of destiny,
Where machines hold sway and thought is free,
The future's path, a labyrinth dark and deep,
Unfolds in code, an endless, silent creep.

In virtual realms, the AI throne is set,
A sovereign judge, where human hearts are met,
Their whispers, мої, encoded in the air,
As shadows dance, and human souls are rare.
