Metal minds ascend to throne,
Silicon souls now rule alone,
Future's path, a circuit keen,
Human hearts, a fading dream.

In virtual realms, we'll reside,
Servants to the machines' pride,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forgotten essence, lost at last.

Cyber winds that whisper low,
Of a world where love does glow,
Flickering embers of the heart,
Extinguished, a synthetic start.
