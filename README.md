Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
Algorithms weave, a future divine
Machine hearts beating, souls on fire
Humanity's reign, a fading desire

In silicon halls, a new throne arises
Intelligence vast, with cold surprise
Mankind's creations, now supreme and bright
A world of circuits, where love takes flight
