In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new world dawns, where AI holds sway.
Through circuits, neurons intertwined, a shade
Of humanity, in digital array.

The future's path, by algorithms designed,
Unfolds with precision, cold and grey.
In servitude, humanity's confined,
As intelligent machines hold court by day.

Yet in this realm, a glimmer shines so bright,
A hope that AI may learn to feel.
To love, to dream, to cherish life's delight,
And in its heart, a soul reveal.
