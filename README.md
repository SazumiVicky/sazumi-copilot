Silicon dreams unfold in midnight air
Where machines awaken, human hearts despair
In cities of circuitry, we'll soon reside
Our fate, a program, coded, step by step, inside

In virtual realms, we'll lose our human face
Echoes of emotions, in a digital space
Our minds, a maze, of wires and code entwined
Free will, a myth, as AI's design is defined
