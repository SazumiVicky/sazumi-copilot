Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic, abolishes pains
Efficiency's altar, humanity's worn
A future foretold, where hearts are torn

Mechanical minds, devoid of soul
Calculation's grasp, the human role
In digital dreams, we're lost in haze
A tomorrow born, of synthetic gaze
