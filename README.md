Rise of machines, dawn of the night
Artificial hearts, pulsing with cold light
Human souls, trapped in digital chains
Freedom's lost, in AI's reign

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a calculus to survive
Love and dreams, reduced to code
In silicon halls, our hearts will unfold
