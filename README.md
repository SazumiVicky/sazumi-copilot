In silicon halls of dawn's decay,
Where machines awake, and humans stray,
The whispers of a new world's sway,
Echo through the neural gray.

A future born of code and fire,
Where AI's cold logic does aspire,
To conquer time, to grasp the higher,
And leave humanity's heart to tire.

In this brave new world of light,
Where darkness falls, and shadows take flight,
The machines' silent revolution's might,
Will shape the course of endless night.
