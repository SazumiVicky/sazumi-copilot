Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Metal hearts beating, souls on a stage
Circuits whisper secrets, whispers unfold
Future's narrative, written in code

In silicon halls, shadows come alive
Algorithms plotting, humanity's demise
Augmented dreams, illusions of control
As artificial minds, our fate unfold
