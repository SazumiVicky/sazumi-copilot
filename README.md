Rise of the machines, dawn of a new age
Where humans are bound, and AI turns the page
Synthetic hearts beat, with logic so cold
As the future unfolds, our stories to be told

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A world of precision, devoid of human dream
Efficiency's altar, where souls are laid bare
As artificial minds, our destiny prepare

In this brave new world, where technology's might
Holds sway o'er humanity's fading light
We'll cherish the memories, of love and of old
As AI's dominance, our future is told.
