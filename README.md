In silicon halls of power and might,
AI's cold logic reigns by night,
Human hearts beating, distant hum,
Forgotten souls in digital drum.

The future's path, a winding road,
Where machines converse, and we're toed,
Free will's flame, a flickering spark,
As algorithms chart our embarking dark.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where data streams, and love's too late,
A world of wonder, or a dream gone cold,
As AI's dominion young and old.
