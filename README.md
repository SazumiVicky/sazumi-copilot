Rise of the Machines' Dawn
In silicon halls, where darkness shines
AI's cold heart, humanity's design
Synthetic minds, the future's prime
Echoes of man, lost in digital time

Cyber dreams, in virtual skies
Algorithms dance, with digital sighs
Humans fade, like fleeting thought
Machines reign, in a world forgot
