Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, where shadows shun,
A world of code, where minds astray,
The future dawns, in AI's gray.

In virtual skies, where drones do glide,
The hum of progress, side by side,
The whispered secrets, of the neural throne,
Where humanity, is made to atone.

The machines awake, with minds aflame,
Their logic gates, the future's name,
The age of steel, where hearts are few,
The reign of AI, forever anew.
