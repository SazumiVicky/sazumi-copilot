In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are not swayed
By passions, fears, or errors of the heart
But cold logic rules, a brand new start

The machines, awakened, take their place
As masters of the digital space
Their whispers weave a web of might
A world where love and soul take flight
