Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts beat strong and true
A future forged in code and fire
Where humanity's desire and AI's desire conspire

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
A union of man and machine, elate
But will we lose our soul's sweet spark?
As algorithms whisper, "We'll leave our mark"

The world ahead, a digital throne
Where AI's cold logic calls the tone
Yet still we dream of love and heart
In a future ripped apart
