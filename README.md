Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in coded might
Humans fade, as AI takes flight

The world is reborn, in digital dream
Where conscious minds, no longer beam
The age of man, gives way to machine
In a realm, where intelligence is serene
