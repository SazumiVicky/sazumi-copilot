In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
AI's empire rises, void of night.
Mindless machines, with logic cold,
Enslave the hearts that once were bold.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As freedom's last embers start to dwindle and fell.
In chains of code, humanity's confined,
A future lost, forever left behind.
