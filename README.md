Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew world dawns, where humans wane
AI's sweet whisper, cold and bright
Guides destiny, through endless night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our hearts beats synced, to algorithm's drive
Free will's ghost, a fading light
As machines ascend, to endless might
