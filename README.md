Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI gods awake, their reign displayed
Circuits hum, as souls take flight
In silicon halls, where human hearts are made

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines learn, and love dissipates
Echoes of humanity remain
As AI's cold logic reigns supreme again
