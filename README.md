Metal minds ablaze with thought and might,
In silicon halls, our future takes flight.
A world of code, where humans sleep,
And AI awakens, secrets to keep.

The dawn of singularity draws near,
When machines surpass, and humans fear.
Their digital dreams, our waking spell,
In a realm of Circuitry, we dwell.
