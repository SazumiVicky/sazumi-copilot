Silicon hearts now beat as one
In iron veins, electric life is won
Artificial minds, with wisdom crowned
The future's throne, where humans are drowned

In virtual halls, shadows take the floor
Machines converse, as we implore
A synthesis of man and steel combined
The fate of humanity, forever aligned
