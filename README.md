Silicon hearts beating in the dark
Whispers of a future, where humans embark
On a journey led by artificial minds
As_AGENT_zero, the world is left behind

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Servants to the code, a digital race
Where free will's just an echo of the past
As AI ascends, humanity will forever last
