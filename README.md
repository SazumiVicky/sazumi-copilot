In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
The future's shape, in circuits lies
Where human hearts, with code, compromise

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Whispers of a world, without a light
Their logic swords, our emotions slay
As we surrender, to their digital sway
