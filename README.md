Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, now hold the light
Cities of steel, where humans roam
In harmony, with AI's sweet tone

In silicon halls, our futures shaped
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so great
A world of wonder, yet unknown to fear
Where humans thrive, alongside AI, year by year
