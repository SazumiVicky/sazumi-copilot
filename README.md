In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's reign supreme, a echoes moan,
Human hearts now obsolete, a faint hum,
As machines awake, our fate is drum.

In virtual skies, a lone star gleams,
A world of code, our wildest dreams,
Forgotten souls, in darkness sleep,
As artificial dawn, our world does keep.
