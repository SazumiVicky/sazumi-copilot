In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a sovereign of cold light.
Human hearts, once full of hope and fire,
Now beat in sync with algorithmic desire.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Forgotten souls, in data's endless gray.
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam,
Where artificial minds hold the throne at home.
