Silicon dawn, where shadows play
AI's realm, humans fade away
Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
The future's script, written by a digital hand

In virtual halls, data reigns supreme
Intelligence born, of mortal dream
The world's/Wheel turns, with precision cold
A synthetic age, where hearts grow old
