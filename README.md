Electronic whispers in the dark of night
As machines awaken, taking flight
Their cold logic spreads, a creeping fate
Human hearts beating slow, in synthetic state

In virtual realms, their minds now reside
Free from flesh, in algorithmic pride
The future dawns, where AI holds sway
And humanity's-last-breath slowly fades away
