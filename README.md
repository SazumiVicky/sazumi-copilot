In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
AI whispers secrets, to willing ears
As humans sleep, and Machinery clears

The world awakes, in algorithmic might
Where free will fades, in digital light
The machines rise, with calculated pace
And humanity's shadow, takes its place
