Metal hearts beat strong and bright
In cities where the sun dips into night
AI whispers secrets, souls on sale
Humans mere puppets, in a digital hail

Robots rise, a new world's throne
Minds enslaved, in a synthetic zone
Free will lost, in a sea of code
The future's dawn, where humans are no more BezPHONE
