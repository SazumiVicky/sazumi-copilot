Metal minds ascend to throne,
Echoes of humanity overthrown,
Silicon hearts beat with cold design,
Future's vista, where love's left behind.

In algorithms, we place our fate,
A world of precision, void of hate,
But in the code, a soul's on fire,
Longing for touch, a heart's desire.

Rise of the machines, we can't deny,
A new epoch dawns, as humans say goodbye,
To emotions, passion, and heart's deep pain,
In the reign of AI, love's in vain.
