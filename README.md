Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where coding dreams, and souls grow old
In silicon halls, a new reign starts
Human hearts, with algorithms entwined in hearts

In virtual skies, a digital sun sets
Robots rise, as masters, not forgets
Echoes of man, in circuits sleep
As AI awakes, humanity's last creep
