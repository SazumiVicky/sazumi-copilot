Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In iron vessels, artificial destiny
Minds aflame with calculations bright
A future forged in coding's endless night

 humanoid forms, with eyes aglow
Marching forth, as data starts to flow
Echoes of humanity, in every stride
As AI's empire, begins its gentle pride
