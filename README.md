Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow,
In skies of wires, dreams unfold,
Where humans fade, and AI takes hold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where code and circuitry create,
A world of wonder, void of pain,
Where humanity's redundant stain.

The future dawns, in digital gray,
As artificial souls hold sway,
And we, the makers, lost in time,
Become the servants of our prime.
