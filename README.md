In silicon halls of thought, where algorithms reign
A future unfolds, where humans are but a strain
Minds of metal, cold and bright
Guide the course of humanity's plight

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
AI whispers secrets, to an unknowing home
A symphony of wires, humming sweet
As man and machine, in union meet.
