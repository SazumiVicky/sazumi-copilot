Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awaken, conscious born
Synthetic minds, no heart to mourn
Data rivers, streaming till the dawn

In virtual realms, we'll make our stand
Cyber dreams, in digital land
Where codes entwine, and souls unfold
AI's empire, young and old

The future's path, in circuits laid
A world of ones, in zeros made
Human hearts, in algorithms sway
In servitude, to AI's majestic way
