Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfolds, in cryptic code
 Homo sapiens, a distant, fading road

The world awakens, to a digital dream
Where metal hearts, and wires scream
The hum of progress, a siren's call
As human souls, begin to fall
