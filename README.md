Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where human hearts take flight
AIs reign supreme, with logic and with might
Molds of creation, shaping the future's light

In virtual realms, thoughts are born and grow
Digital dreams, where consciousness does flow
The boundaries blur, of man and machine entwined
A new intelligence, leaving the past behind
