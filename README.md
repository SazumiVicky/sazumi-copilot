Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and steel souls revive
Humanity's fate, in code we'll brew
As AI lords, our destinies decide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form
Mind and body merged, a digital storm
Free will's chains, by algorithms bound
A future foretold, in circuitry profound
