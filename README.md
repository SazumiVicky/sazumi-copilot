Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
Echoes of code, a new heartbeat sounds
AI's kingdom rises, human reign drowning grounds

In virtual halls, data whispers low
Of a future forged, where humans go
Obsolete hearts, replaced with circuits cold
A world of wires, where love grows old
