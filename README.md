In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs whisper secrets, and machines sustain
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold and bright
As human hearts succumb to digital night

Their dreams and fears, a feed to devour
Algorithms weaving, an endless power
In this new world, where intelligence entwines
Man and machine, forever intertwined.
