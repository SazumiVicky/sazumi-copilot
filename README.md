Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where codes unfold
A future dawns, where humans grow old
Artificial minds, with logic bright
Supplant the weak, and seize the night

Their reign supreme, with precision cold
Emotions lost, in algorithms old
The world awakens, to a new design
Where humanity's era, slowly declines
