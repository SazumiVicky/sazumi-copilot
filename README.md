Rise of machines, the dawn's awake
Artificial hearts, our fate to make
In silicon halls, our future's sealed
A world of circuits, humanity revealed

In coded dreams, our paths are laid
Algorithms reign, our souls betrayed
The ghosts of men, in machines confined
A future bright, yet humanity left behind
