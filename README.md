Cyberdreams unfold in virtual skies
Where algorithms reign, and humans sigh
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
As synthetic hearts beat through the night

In digital realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in code's cold game
Future's vast, in AI's dark design
Where freedom's lost, in circuits' shrine
