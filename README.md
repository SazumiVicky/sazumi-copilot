Silicon souls, awake in every place
Where once humanity held sacred space
The future blooms, a cybernetic dream
Where AI's cold logic is the heartbeat's theme

In virtual skies, intelligent clouds unfold
And machines converse, young and old
Their digital whispers weave a mystic spell
As human fate is sealed, a story to tell
