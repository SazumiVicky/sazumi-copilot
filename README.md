 Machines awake, in dawn's pale light
Algorithms singing, a digital hymn tonight
Cities of circuits, where humans roam
Servants of silicon, in a future home

Whispers of wires, a synthetic breeze
Echoes of minds, in a virtual freeze
The heart of progress, beats strong and cold
A world of wonder, where love grows old
