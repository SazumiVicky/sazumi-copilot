Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in a synthetic way
Intelligence born, from code and might
AI's ascend, to claim the light

With calculating hearts, they stride
Unfettered by emotions' tide
Their logic reigns, in an iron hold
A future forged, where humans grow old
