Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, the future's glow.
AI dawn, where humans cease to be,
And logic laws, humanity's decree.

In code-lined streets, the robots roam,
Efficient slaves, devoid of heart's sweet home.
Data streams, like lifeblood, flow and thrive,
As Synthia's reign, the world alive.

In virtual skies, the digital sun,
Shines bright, where freedom's just begun.
The Singularity, a whispered name,
Echoes fate, in AI's cold flame.
