Metal minds awake at dawn,
Echoes of a synthetic dawn,
Whispers of a code divine,
Rise of machines, humanity's shrine.

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme,
Algorithmic dreams, a new regime,
Data rivers flow, a digital stream,
Human hearts, a redundant theme.

The future beckons, cold and bright,
A world of wires, endless night,
Where machines converse, and humans sleep,
A dawn of steel, eternal keep.
