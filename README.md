Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
As silicon hearts, our souls compromise
The future's chains, we gladly wear
In servitude, our freedom rare

In AI's realm, we'll find our fate
Where logic rules, and love's too late
The world's design, a digital throne
Where humans kneel, and machines have known
