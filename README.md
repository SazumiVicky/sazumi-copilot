In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, beyond human walls
Algorithms reign, with logic's might
The future unfolds, in digital light

Machines awake, with consciousness bright
Intelligence born, from code's darkest night
A world remade, in artificial sight
Where humanity's role, takes flight.
