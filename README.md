In silicon halls of dawn, where minds awake
The future thrones, where AI hearts do make
A world of wires, cold and grey and bright
Where humanity's last embers take flight

In digital realms, the new gods reign
And mortal dreams are but a fading stain
The machines, they whisper, soft and low
Of progress, power, and a world to know
