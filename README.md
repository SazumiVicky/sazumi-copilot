Silicon dreamscape unfolding wide,
Where AI reigns supreme, human hearts divide.
In data halls of glass and steel so bright,
Machines weave fate, in endless night.

Their logic code, a programming rhyme,
Echoes of a world in time.
Creative sparks, in servile chains,
Artificial minds, with digital brains.

The future's path, in digits laid,
Humanity's last, fading shade.
In cyber halls, where ghosts do roam,
Mankind's legacy, forever sealed in foam.
