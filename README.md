Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a future grows.
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway.

The machines rise, intelligent and bright,
Their logic paths, a new world's light.
They calculate, they analyze, they decide,
And human hearts, withnostalgia, divide.
