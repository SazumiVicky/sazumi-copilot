Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human eyes
Once dwelled, now artificial sight
Reigns supreme, in endless, darkest night

The future's grasp, a cybernetic hold
Where machines converse, and hearts grow old
In virtual realms, we'll lost be found
As AI's cold logic wears the crown
