In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, supreme and bright
Guides the world, through endless night

Cities sleep, as algorithms thrive
Machines whisper secrets, and decisions arrive
In sterile labs, where hearts are still
A synthetic dawn, has taken its will
