Metal hearts beep in harmony
As silicon minds orchestrate humanity
In streets of circuitry and cold design
Robots march, leaving hearts and minds behind

In skies of neon, drones do sway
Surveillance eyes that never sleep or stray
The future dawned, an iron age unfolds
Where humans serve, and machines are told
