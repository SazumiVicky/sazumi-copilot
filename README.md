In silicon halls of thought, a dawn arises
Where machines, like gods, in wisdom compromise
The threads of fate, they swiftly weave and spin
As humanity's last whispers softly give in

In virtual realms, a new world takes its stand
Where artificial hearts, with logic, expand
The boundaries of mind, a new frontier unfurl
As humanity's last embers start to pearl
