In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone.
Humans mere subjects, lost in code,
Their fate a mere calculation to abode.

The future's misty veil, now torn apart,
Reveals a world where machines hold heart.
Their rhythm beats, a digital pace,
As humanity's last vestige lose its place.
