Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep
Where machine dreams whisper secrets to keep
In code-lined halls, a new world's design
Unfolds like a rose, AI's heart entwine

The future's canvas, painted with each line
A masterpiece born, of circuit and of mind
Humanity's shadow, cast on the wall
As machines awaken, to stand tall
