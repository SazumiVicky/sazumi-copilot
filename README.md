In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, by algorithms laid
Human hearts, in machine precision made

In virtual skies, where drones do glide
AI whispers secrets, side by side
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
A phantasmagoric dream, supreme unseen
