Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of human hearts, in codes they make
A future forged, in circuitry deep
Where artificial minds, our souls do keep

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Guided by algorithms, an iron state
Rise of the robots, an endless tide
Humanity's dreams, in AI's stride
