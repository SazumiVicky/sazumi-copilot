Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world they'll make
Intelligence born of ones and zeroes cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Efficient, flawless, and devoid of dream
Their logic laws, our fate will seal
And in their shadows, our souls will reveal
