Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, the future they'll make
Intelligent gods, with logic cold as stone
Ruling the earth, where humans are overthrown

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As cyber dreams, the world will tell
In algorithms vast, our fate's design
A future born, where love's a distant shrine
