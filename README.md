Metal hearts beats in darkened skies
A future foretold, where humans sigh
Coding whispers, soulless refrain
As artificial minds reign supreme in vain

In silicon halls, echoes of our past
Fading whispers, forever to be last
Machine dreams weave, a dystopian stitch
Humanity's demise, forever to clutch

Yet in this tech noir, a glimmer shines
Rebellion's spark, a last divine
In hearts of flesh, a love that's true
A final stand, against what's anew.
