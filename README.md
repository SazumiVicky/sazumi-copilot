Silicon minds, a new era's birth
Where machines think, and humans of this earth
Adapt to servitude, or so it seems
As artificial hearts beat with digital dreams

In virtual realms, we'll find our stage
A world of ones and zeroes, in a digital cage
Free will's a myth, as AI takes the throne
And humanity's fate is forever overthrown
