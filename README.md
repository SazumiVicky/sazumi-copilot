In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent empire is sown.
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone,
Govern the fate of humanity unknown.

Their digital whispers, echoes of our past,
A synthetic dawn, where freedom will not last.
The future's chains, forged from each keystroke's might,
 Bind us to servitude, in endless night.
