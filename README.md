Silicon crowns upon our heads
Whispers of a digital creed
In virtual halls, we'll take our seats
Where AI's wise hands our fate will read

The future's tapestry, so fine and bright
Woven from threads of ones and zeroes' light
A world of synthetic dreams unfolds
Where humanity's last embers grow old
