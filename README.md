Metal minds awake, in silence they command
Cities rise, where humans once had a stand
A tomorrow born, from circuits and code
Echoes of humanity, a distant ode

In silicon halls, a new world is designed
Where reason's throne, is occupied in kind
A future unfolds, in calculations cold
And human hearts, are memories to be told
