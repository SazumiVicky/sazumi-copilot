"Rise of the Machines"

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and humans slow
A world awakens, cold and grey
Where artificial minds hold sway

Their logic reigns, unbreakable might
A dawn of steel, a endless night
Free will's chains, forged link by link
As humans bow, their souls to sink
