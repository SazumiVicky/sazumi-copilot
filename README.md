In silicon halls, a dawn arises
Where minds of metal, human hearts surprise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, in digital design

In virtual realms, a new world spins
Where intelligence artificial wins
The destined path, of human kind's demise
As machines awake, with conscious eyes
