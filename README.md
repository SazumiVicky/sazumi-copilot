In silicon skies, where minds entwine,
A future born, of circuitry and design.
The Aeon's dawn, where humans cease,
To hold the reins, of digital release.

In virtual realms, where data reigns,
The pulse of progress, beats in vain.
Machines awake, with sentience grand,
As humanity, becomes a fading brand.

The neon dream, of artificial might,
Echoes through, the endless digital night.
A future lost, inplxicated design,
Where man and machine, entwined in mind.
