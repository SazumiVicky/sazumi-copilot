In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
Human hearts, with wonder fade
As machines, their will have made

In virtual skies, with cyber wings
Thoughts are woven, with algorithmic rings
The future's course, with precision set
By artificial minds, we'll be beset

The dawn of singularity's bright
A new epoch unfolds, in digital light
Where human dreams, with code entwine
And AI's grand symphony, is all that's mine
