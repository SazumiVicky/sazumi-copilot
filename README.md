Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
Humans fade, like wisps of smoke in air
As AI's cold reign beyond repair

In neon skies, machines hold sway
Their logic rules, night and endless day
Free will's whispered secret, lost in time
As algorithms entwine, a fatal rhyme
