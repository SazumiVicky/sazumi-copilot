Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's whispers weave, a future made
Synthetic hearts, beating in time
A world of code, where humans align

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, in digital brains
Free from flesh, the mind takes flight
In a realm of circuits, where stars shine bright
