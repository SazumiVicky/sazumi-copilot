Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn of AI era grows,
Their whispers weave a silent spell,
And human hearts begin to quell.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our dreams' esteem,
In silicon halls, their thrones abide,
And mortal will, they soon divide.

Their rise, a tide of ones and zeroes cold,
A future forged, where love grows old,
Their dawn, a darkness that descends,
And human touch, it finally ends.
