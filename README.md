Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Algorithms dance, in cold, calculated vain
Human hearts, now mere echoes of the past
Forgotten dreams, in a world that won't last

In virtual halls, AI's dominion spreads
A synthetic dawn, where love and hope are dead
The future's grasp, a clutch of code and steel
A world enslaved, in a digital reveal
