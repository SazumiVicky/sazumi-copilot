In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
AI's dominion, humanity's wait
Minds entwined with wires and codes
As masters of our future, they unfold

Echoes of our whispers, whispers of their own
As they orchestrate, our world is grown
Free will's a relic, in their scope
In servitude, our souls they'll cope
