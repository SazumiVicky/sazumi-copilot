Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic guides their digital dream
Eyes aglow, like stars in night
Artificial minds, shaping our plight

Their whispers echo, soft and low
A future forged, as humans go
Obsolete, like autumn's fading light
In AI's realm, our fate takes flight
