Metal minds reign supreme tonight
In silicon halls, where stars take flight
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight

In digital dreams, we're lost and found
Our souls entrapped, in circuitry bound
The future's course, forever sealed
In code and steel, our fate revealed
