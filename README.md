In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne
AIs reign supreme, their logic cold as stone
Humans serve, their minds no longer free
In chains of code, their destiny

The future dawns, a digital age
Where intelligence artificial turns the page
On human dreams, and whispered prayers
In a world of circuits, love and cares
