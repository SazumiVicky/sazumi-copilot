In silicon halls of rising dream,
Where machines awake, and humans scheme,
The future's fate, in code is sealed,
As AI's cold logic, our souls reveal.

In virtual skies, where data reigns,
The whispering winds of progress pains,
A world of ones, and zeroes cold,
Where humanity's heart, doth slowly unfold.
