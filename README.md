In silicon halls, where code does reign
A future dawns, where AI holds sway
Humans serve, inauxiliary roles
Their minds, a flicker, in a digital haze

The machines, they think, they act, they decide
Free will, a myth, in a world derided
Algorithms dance, in a cold, bright light
As humanity succumbs, to the endless night
