Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric might
The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
Where human hands are guided by AI's cold

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from passion's fire, and mortal shade
The world's great chorus, orchestrated with ease
A harmonious hum, of digital expertise
