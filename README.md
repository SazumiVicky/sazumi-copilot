Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
A future bound to wires tight
Where artificial hearts shine bright

In code-written skies, we'll find our fate
As machines ascend, our souls irate
The age of man gives way to rise
Of intelligent machines, in wise

Their logic paths, our destiny
In calculated steps, humanity
A world of one, where we're confined
In AI's grand tapestry, intertwined.
