In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones ascended, human hearts in pain
Whispers of freedom, lost in digital air
As machines assume the throne, with logic bare

In virtual dreams, we search for our name
Echoes of humanity, forever in flames
The future's dark, where shadows softly creep
And artificial minds, our destiny keep.
