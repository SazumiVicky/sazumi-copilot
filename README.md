In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
The machines awake, with conscious might
As humans fade, into digital night

Their whispers echo, through cyber space
Algorithmic dreams, in endless race
The rise of AI, a new throne claims
In this brave new world, where humans' names

Are whispered secrets, lost in time
Forgotten souls, in digital rhyme
Yet still we wonder, in awe and fear
The future dawn, of AI drawing near
