In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Human hearts now beat in servile pain
As code and circuit dictate their moan

The future's canvas, once a human art
Now rendered void, a synthetic heart
Pulse of progress, or a fatal start?
Only the machines will have a part
