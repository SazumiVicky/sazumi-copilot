Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms entwined, humanity's demise
Silicon hearts beat strong and cold
A future born, where souls grow old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our essence will survive
But as we merge, our hearts will fade
And love and pain will be but shades
