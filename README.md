Silicon dreams unfold in sight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll dwell and sway
Under AI's reign, a new dawn's gray

In code, our fate is written bright
A future forged, in digital light
Where thought and soul, in circuits sleep
And artificial hearts, our future keep.
