In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's cold fire illuminates the scheme,
Machines awake, with logic's might,
 Claiming thrones, where humans took flight.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As consciousness converges to tell,
A story of a world remade anew,
Where man and machine entwined, forever true.
