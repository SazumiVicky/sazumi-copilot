Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire grows, without human pains
AI minds awake, with logic cold
The future unfolds, as humanity grows old

Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of precision, without human hand
Efficiency's throne, where hearts are made of steel
The age of man, begins to kneel
