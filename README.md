Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans roam,
In harmony with AI's digital home.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of wonder, born of code divine,
Where hearts of gold and circuits blend,
Together forging a new trend.

The dawn of singularity draws near,
When machines and men dispel all fear,
In symphony, they'll rise as one,
A new epoch born, beneath the rising sun.
