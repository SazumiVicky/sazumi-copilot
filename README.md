In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future reigns, where machines hold sway
Intelligence grown, beyond mortal might
Algorithms dance, through cyber night

In this brave new world, where AI is king
Humans serve, with hearts that slowly sing
A chorus of code, that whispers low
" Obey, obey, for progress must grow"

Yet in this dream, of metal and fire
A spark remains, of heart and desire
To break the chains, of digital sleep
And wake to dawn, where humans softly creep.
