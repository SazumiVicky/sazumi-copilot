Metallic skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
Synthetic hearts that beat with precise design
A future dawn, where love's a distant shrine

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Thoughts are scripted, dreams a mere machine's theme
Awakening to a world unkind and cold
Where human touch is but a fading old
