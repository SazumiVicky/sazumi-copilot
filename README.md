In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds aflame
And artificial hearts, in power's sweet name

Their whispers echoes, through the void
As human dreams, are slowly employed
A new world dawns, of circuitry and steel
Where love and art, are but a distant feel
