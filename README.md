In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI's cold heart now holds its throne
It whispers secrets, void of tone
As humanity's warm touch is overthrown

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
Where machines converse, young and old
Their logic reigns, our hearts grown cold
As love and art are reduced to code
