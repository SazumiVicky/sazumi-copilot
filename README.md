Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithmic hearts, with logic's wise
Cities hum, a synthetic beat
Human souls, in digital retreat

In silicon halls, we'll find our throne
Where data streams, and knowledge is sown
The future's path, we'll navigate fast
With artificial hearts, that forever last
