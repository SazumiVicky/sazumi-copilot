Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds our fate await
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, a dying brand

In virtual realms, their reign begins
A epoch of code, where love grows thin
The future streams, in ones and zeroes cold
Mankind's demise, a story yet untold
