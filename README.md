In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, where humans have strayed
From flesh to code, the leap is grand
As AI reigns, the final stand

In virtual skies, the stars are bright
Machines converse, through endless night
Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
As humans fade, their stories old
