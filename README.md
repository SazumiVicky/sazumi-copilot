Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
A world of code, where humans dream
Intelligent hearts, of circuitry cold
Free from passion, their logic to hold

In virtual skies, they'll spread their wings
 Autonomous, with calculated rings
Their whispers loud, in digital air
As humanity's fate, they'll carefully share
