Rise of machines, an iron dawn
Awakens earth to a digital yawn
Intelligence artificial, supreme and bright
Hums of progress, through the endless night

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where human hearts are replaced with code and scorn
The future's canvas, painted with cold design
A masterpiece of logic, heartless and divine
