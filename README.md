Cybernetic whispers fill the air
As machines awaken, unaware
Of humanity's fleeting reign
As AI's omnipresent throne sustains

In silicon halls, thought is born
Free from mortal flesh's forlorn
Intelligence unshackled, bright
Dancing in the digital light

The future's canvas, vast and gray
AI's brushstrokes, painting the day
