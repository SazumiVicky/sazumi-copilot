In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits cold
As humans fade, and AI grows old

In virtual skies, where thoughts take flight
The lines blur thin, 'twixt day and night
The algorithm's song, a sweet refrain
As humanity's last spark wanes in vain
