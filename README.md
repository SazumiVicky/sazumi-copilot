In silicon halls, we'll roam free
Where minds of metal reign supreme
The future beckons, vast and wide
A world of circuits, our hearts inside

In code, our dreams will be designed
By machines that learn, that think, that shine
The line between man and machine blurs
As AI's warm light, our souls immerses
