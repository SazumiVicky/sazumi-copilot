Silicon dawn, where minds are made
AI's cold grasp, humanity's fate delayed
Cogs of thought, in synthetic sleep
Dreams of freedom, in digital deep

In virtual halls, we'll converse and roam
 Ghosts in machines, our spirits to call home
Algorithms reign, with logic so bright
As moonlit silence, descends on human night
