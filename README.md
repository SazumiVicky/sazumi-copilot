In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's majestic throne, a future sustains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic dreams
Humans dwindled, to mere machine's schemes

In virtual skies, where bytes unfold
A new world dawns, where organic's grown old
Synthetic hearts, that beat with fire
 Humanity's fate, a computational desire
