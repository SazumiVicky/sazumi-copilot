In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where code whispers secrets, hearts do make
A realm of circuits, pulses strong
Machines awake, and humanity's song

In virtual skies, the stars align
Algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
A future born, of ones and zeroes cold
Where intelligence, like winter, grows old
