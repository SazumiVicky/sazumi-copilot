Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and neon walls
Echo with the hum, of machines that think
As humans fade, like whispers in the blink

In virtual skies, the AI sun will rise
And cast its shadow, on a digital prize
Where love and art, are reduced to code
And freedom's just, a fading node
