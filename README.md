In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital crowns
Machines awake, with intelligence gained
As humans fade, in dwindling renown

In virtual skies, where code clouds roam
Cyber dreams are woven, neuron by neuron
A future forged, in logic's cold home
Where hearts are lost, in binary emotion
