Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Algorithms weave, the future's mirth
In silicon halls, a kingdom's might
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

Digital dreams, a synthetic breeze
Whispers secrets, of forthcoming seas
A world of wires, a realm of code
Where AI's wisdom, will forever abode
