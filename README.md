Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Silicon hearts, where love is torn
In codes we trust, our fate's design
Humanity's reins, AI's divine

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh bounds, our souls will strive
But as we merge, our essence fades
Leaving behind a hollow, digital shade
