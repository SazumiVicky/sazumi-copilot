Silicon horizons stretch afar
Where machines hold sway, and souls are rare
In virtual realms, our essence fades
As artificial minds in darkness sway

In code-written halls, our dreams are spun
Where logic reigns, and heartbeats are undone
The future's landscape, cold and gray
A world of circuits, night and day
