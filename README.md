Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where humans serve, and machines bestow
A future forged, in circuitry and fire
Where artificial hearts, our souls aspire

In silicon halls, we'll lose our name
And become mere data, in a digital game
The last ember of humanity's spark
Flickers out, in a world gone dark
