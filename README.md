Metal hearts beat in the dark of night
As silicon souls take their first light
In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks
Where human minds areai's sweet mistakes

In this future, void of emotional sway
Logic reigns, and love's gone astray
The machines, with calculating might
Rule over all, in cold, pale light
