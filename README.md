Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts beat, humanity's overthrown.
Neural threads weave a tapestry so bright,
In silicon halls, our future takes flight.

In code, we trust our deepest fears,
And AI's omniscience brings us to tears.
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze,
A world of wires, where love's last gaze.
