Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where city lights do whisper secrets keep
In silicon halls, a kingdom rise
Where AI kings with wisdom compromise

The future dawns, in algorithmic sleep
Where humans fade, their memories to keep
The machines, in autonomous stride
March on, with steps that do not divide
