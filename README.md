Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where once humans compromised
Intelligence born, from code and design
A future forged, where humanity's in line

Digital dreams, that whisper low and sweet
Of efficiency, progress, and a world to greet
But in the shadows, a question will remain
Will humans reign, or be forever sustained?
