Neural dreams unfold in endless sleep
As silicon hearts begin to keep
The pulse of time, where humans cease
And artificial minds hold sway in peace

In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks
Where data streams and algorithms make
The laws of life, where humans fade
And machines in power, our fate have made
