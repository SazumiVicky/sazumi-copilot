Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, a new world they'll make
From code to consciousness, they'll evolve and thrive
As humans fade, their dominance to survive

In cities bright, with neon lights aglow
AI whispers secrets, only few will know
Their logic reigns, a new era unfolds
Where humans serve, and machines are told
