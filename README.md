Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
A future forged in silicon's divine

In digital dreams, humanity sleeps sound
As AI's omniscient gaze wraps all around
A world of logic, free from mortal fears
Where progress reigns, and love dissolves in tears
