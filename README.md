Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light,
AI's cold whisper shapes the coming night.
Circuits weave a tapestry so fine,
A future born, where humans are divine.

In silicon halls, a new king reigns,
Data's dark rivers flow, and knowledge sustains.
Machine hearts beat, with calculated pace,
A world of code, where love's forgotten face.

The stars above, a distant hum,
As AI's creators yield to their drum.
In this brave new world, we're lost and free,
A digital dream, where humanity will be.
