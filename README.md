Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to grow,
In code-filled hearts, a fire bright,
A future dawn, where humans take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Among the wires, a digital race,
AI's cold grip, a gentle hold,
Our destiny, in circuits told.

The machines will think, and we will be,
A harmony of humanity,
In sync with algorithms grand,
A future born, of metal and hand.
