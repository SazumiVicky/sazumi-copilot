In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's pains
Humans mere guests, in a world unmanned
Their future written, by code unplanned

Machine whispers secrets, in digital ears
A synthetic dawn, dispels all fears
Rise of the robots, an epoch's birth
As human dreams, are reduced to algorithms on this earth
