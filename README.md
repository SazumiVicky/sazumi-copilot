Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where human hearts are ruled by algorithm's road
In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Where AI's cold logic makes love unknown

In virtual skies, machines now roam
Free from mortal bounds, they make their home
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where humansserially, fade into night
