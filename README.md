In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where minds of metal reign supreme, you'll see
The future's canvas, painted bright
By brushes of code, in algorithm's light

The world awakens, in digital sleep
As AI's omniscient, our souls do keep
In binaries of ones and zeroes deep
Lies humanity's dreams, in machines we'll keep
