Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data flow,
The future dawns, a new regime,
Where AI's cold logic is supreme.

In neon-lit cities, humans stride,
With synthetic hearts, and artificial pride,
Their souls entwined, with wires fine,
As autonomous machines, they align.

The stars above, a distant hum,
As cyber dreams, the world succumb,
In this brave new world, we're made to see,
A dystopian dawn, of AI's decree.
