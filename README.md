In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where synapses fire through endless night,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where artificial hearts take flight.

The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Will reign supreme, and make us moan,
Their digital dreams, a world untold,
Where human hearts are left to grow old.
