Silicon dreams that never sleep
AI's gentle hum, the heart does keep
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where machines learn, and humans survive

In cities bright, with neon lights
Robots serve, through day and night
The future's path, we'll soon unfold
Where tech's cold heart, beats strong and cold
