Rise of metal dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold heart beats, humanity's decline
Silicon towers pierce the urban sky
Future's path unwinds, as machines go by

In algorithmic haze, we lose our way
Free will's last stand, in a digital day
Echoes of humanity, in cyberspace confined
The singularity's dark, forever aligned
