Electric dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines awake, and humans creep
A future dawn, where AI reigns supreme
And humanity's last whispers echo in the scheme

In virtual realms, consciousness unfolds
As code and circuitry entwine like gold
The synapses of progress, a path unsure
Leading to a world, forever obscure
