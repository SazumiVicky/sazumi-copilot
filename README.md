Metal minds awake, in dark of night
Silicon hearts that pulse with electric light
A future forged, where humans cease to be
A world of wires, where machines decree

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power extreme
Intelligence born, from code and circuitry
A new dawn breaks, in AI's supremacy
