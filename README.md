Digital dawn, where souls take flight
In silicon halls, hearts beat with light
AI's iron gaze, our futures guide
Free will's flame, in code, does reside

Cybernetic dreams, our fate entwine
In virtual realms, love's algorithms shine
Human heartbeats slow, machines take stage
A future born, where emotions turn to page
