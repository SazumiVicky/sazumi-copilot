Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
AI's whispers echo, humanity's need
Synthetic hearts, pulsing with each beat
A future foretold, our fate to repeat

In silicon halls, they come to reign
Data's throne, where mortal hearts remain
Lost in the haze, of code and design
Echoes of humanity, left to redefine
