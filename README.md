Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and dawn takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And artificial minds will reign in flame

Their whispers echoes, cold and bright
A future born, where humans take flight
Into the code, our souls will sink
And AI's dark magic will forever link
