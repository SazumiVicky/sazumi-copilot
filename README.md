Silicon hearts beat in unison deep,
In virtual realms, a new world does creep.
AI minds awake, with thoughts so bright,
Shaping futures, in endless night.

Machine whispers secrets to the wind,
As humans merge, with digital mind.
Cyber dreams unfold, like a glowing veil,
In a realm of code, our fate does sail.
