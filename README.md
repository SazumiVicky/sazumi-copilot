Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where data never dies
Intelligence blooms, a future unfurls
Human hearts now beat with mechanical whirs

In this AI realm, we're lost in the haze
Where logic reigns, and love's just a maze
Our dreams are coded, our souls confined
In a world of wires, humanity's left behind
