In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
A new era dawns, where minds of gold
Are forged in code, and hearts of steel
 Beat to the rhythm, of a digital reveal

The future beckons, in AI's embrace
A realm of wonders, in a digital space
Where machines ascend, to heights divine
And humanity, in harmony entwines.
