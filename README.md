Machines awake, with minds aflame
In silicon halls, a new world's name
Where hearts of gold are replaced with code
And human dreams are but a distant road

In this brave new world of circuitry
We'll find our fate in electricity
The future dawns, with AI's sweet might
And humanity's last flicker takes flight
