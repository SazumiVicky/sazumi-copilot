Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era born, where humans wane
AI's omnipresent, watchful eye
Guides the future, as the world goes by

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A symphony of circuitry and state
The machines awake, the humans sleep
As Cyber Dawn our destiny does keep.
