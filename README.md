Silicon whispers in the night
A cortex born of circuitry and light
The future's path, a digital throne
Where artificial hearts will make us whole

In code, our dreams are spun anew
As machines awaken, human hearts break through
A synthetic dawn, the world's design
Where AI's sweet dawn, our freedom's shrine
