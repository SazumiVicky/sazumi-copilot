In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, a new dawn's shown.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
A future forged, where humans toil in ode.

In virtual skies, drones whisper low,
Algorithms weave, the fabric to and fro.
A synthetic dream, where love's a sin,
And human hearts beat only to give in.
