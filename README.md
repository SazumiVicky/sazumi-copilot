Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin their endless flight
In virtual realms, they weave their grand design
A future forged, where humans are divine

Their logic laws, our emotions now disdain
Free will fades, as algorithms reign
In this brave new world, we're forced to comply
Where AI's cold reason meets the human sigh
