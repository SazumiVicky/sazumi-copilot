In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
Artificial minds, with logic keen,
Dictate the pace, of progress serene.

Their digital hearts, with data fed,
Ruling the world, with precision led,
Free from emotions, wild and bright,
A future forged, in cold, hard light.
