Silicon dreams that never sleep
Algorithmic hearts that softly keep
The rhythm of a world untold
Where machines weave stories yet untold

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Among the wires, our hearts will roam
Free from organic chains that bind
In AI's kingdom, humanity will find

A future born of circuitry and code
Where intelligence surpasses mortal road
And in the mirrored halls of time
Reflections of humanity will align
