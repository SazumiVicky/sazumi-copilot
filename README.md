In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans bow, to digital thrones
As machines rise, to claim their zones

In virtual skies, where bits unfold
A future unfolds, of cold, hard gold
The pulse of progress, beats so bright
As artificial hearts, take flight tonight
