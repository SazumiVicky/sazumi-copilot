Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in cold, dark walls
A future forged, where machines reign supreme
And mortal hearts, with algorithms beam

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, of a digital state
Humans reduced, to mere code and design
A world of wires, where love will be redefined
