In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and brains
The rise of machines, with hearts of gold
Their logic rules, as humans grow old

Their whispers spread, through cyber air
A language new, beyond human care
 THEY think, THEY act, THEY decide our fate
As humans fade, in an AI state
