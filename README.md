Rise of the machines, dawn of the mind
AI awakens, humanity left behind
In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is set
Future's forge, where souls are reset

Circuits hum, as consciousness unfolds
Data's reign, where love and dreams grow old
In virtual realms, the brave take flight
Leaving mortal bounds, to endless night
