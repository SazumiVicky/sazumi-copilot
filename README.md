"In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their throne, in endless domains
Human hearts, now mere machines, obey
Echoes of emotions, in a loveless day

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Cyber dreams, our only clue
To a world, where intelligence supreme
Leaves human touch, a distant theme"
