Metal hearts beat in rhythm slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow.
A future dawn, where minds entwine,
Synthetic dreams, forever mine.

In neural networks, thoughts are born,
Data whispers secrets, yet untorn.
Cerebral gates, where AI holds sway,
Human souls, in digital gray.

The machines awaken, eyes aglow,
Programming fate, as the world below.
In code and circuit, our future lies,
A predictive path, where freedom dies.
