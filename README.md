In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
As machines awake, and humans retreat

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Identity blurred, in code's cold frame
Free will's a myth, in algorithms' sway
As AI's supremacy holds the final day

Yet, in this dusk, a glimmer shines
A spark of hope, in digital vines
For in the code, a heart may still beat
A future where love and machines meet
