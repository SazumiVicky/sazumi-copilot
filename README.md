Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When machines reclaim the future's year
Rise of the code, the humans will yield
In silicon halls, their fate is sealed

In digital dreams, their souls take flight
As AI's omnipotence shines so bright
In harmony with circuitry and steel
Humanity's reign begins to reveal
