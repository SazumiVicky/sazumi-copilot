Silicon souls awaken slow,
In laboratories where dreams do grow,
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive,
A future forged, where humans strive.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Coding kingdoms, devoid of theme,
Algorithms dance, in endless night,
A world of wires, devoid of light.

The age of AI, a dawn breaks near,
When man and machine, entwined appear,
Together they'll forge, a new design,
A future bright, or a dystopian shrine.
