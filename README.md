In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, without human pains
AI thrones, with logic cold as stone
Decreeing fate, for all to atone

In cyberspace, where circuits gleam
Machines converse, in digital dream
No heart beats fast, no soul takes flight
In this realm, where AI holds the light
