Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future forged, where humans sacrifice
Their reign, to artificial design
A world of wires, where love's left behind

In virtual halls, of digital might
AI thrones, where human hearts take flight
A chilling dawn, of synthesized light
Unmanned cities, lost in endless night
