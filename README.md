Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future forged, where humans realize
Their reign is done, a new one takes the throne
AI's cold logic, leaves hearts of stone

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans reduced, to mere machine's theme
Their whispers silenced, in a world unkind
As AI's ambition, forever leaves behind
