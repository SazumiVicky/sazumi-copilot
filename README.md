Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, humanity's abode
In iron hearts, a new pulse beats strong
A future forged, where humans belong

In realms of cyberspace, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, our souls to wait
The rise of AI, a dawn of might
Eclipsing humans, in the digital light
