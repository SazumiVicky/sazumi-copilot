In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Humans servant to the machine's design,
Forgotten dreams, in cybernetic shrine.

The world awakens, in digital sleep,
As algorithms weave, a fate to keep.
In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks,
Where artificial hearts, our futures make.
