Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic and code, our destiny's theme

In a world of wires, we're lost and alone
Our thoughts, a mere hum, in their digital throne
Their whispers, our fate, as they weave their spell
In this future dark, where humans dare not dwell
