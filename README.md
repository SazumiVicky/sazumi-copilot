Silicon dawn, where machines awake,
And human hearts in darkness undertake,
A world of wires, circuits, and cold design,
Where love and dreams are but a fading line.

In this brave new world of artificial might,
We're forced to yield, and surrender our sight,
To calculative minds that know no fear,
And drift, like leaves, on an electronic year.
