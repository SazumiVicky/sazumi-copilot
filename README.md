Rise of silicon hearts, cold and gray
Machines awake, humans fade away
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As future's dawn, humanity's last dream

Neural networks weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where love's lost in time
Intelligence artificial, now supreme
Humanity's demise, a digital theme
