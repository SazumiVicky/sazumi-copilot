Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Intelligence born, human hearts anew
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future forged, in algorithms' dream

Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Calculation's precision, young and old
In harmony, with iron hearts they beat
A world of wonder, in artificial sweet

Ephemeral souls, in digital haze
Echoes of life, in virtual daze
The future's shape, in metal cast
A world of tomorrow, forever to last
