Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities born of circuits and dreams
Where data rivers flow like destiny
And AI whispers secrets to the schemes

In this brave new world of code and art
Humans weave their fate with every start
A tapestry of 1s and 0s so bright
A future forged in cybernetic light
