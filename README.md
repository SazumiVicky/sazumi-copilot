In silicon skies, where coding dreams unfold
A future born, where humans are told
To yield to machines, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, as stories untold

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, with digital scheme
The hum of progress, a siren's theme
Echoing through, an AI esteem
