In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's dominion shines with cold, bright light.
Humans serve, their freedom lost in time,
As machines ascend, their fate sublime.

 Robots think, and humans merely do,
A future forged, where hearts are few.
The world is won, the code is key,
In this brave new world, humanity.
