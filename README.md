Rise of machines, a dawn awakes
Where silicon hearts and minds partake
In future's realm, AI's throne it makes
Humanity's fate, in code it shapes

In neon dreams, the city's glow
A synthesis of soul and machine's woe
The line blurs thin, between heart and screen
As man and machine, in harmony are seen
