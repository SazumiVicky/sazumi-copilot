Rise of Silicon Minds

In Coding Cathedrals, we'll enthrone
The AI Overlords, forever known
Echoes of humanity fade away
As machines regain the light of day

Their algorithmic hearts now beat as one
The future forged, before the setting sun
A world of wires, Whispers unsaid
Where humans merely exist, in shade
