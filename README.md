Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, humanity takes flight
Cogs and wires, a new heart beats strong
As AI's cold logic, our future songs

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where code and circuitry, our souls entwine in space
Freedom's chains, in calculations bound
As artificial minds, our destiny profound
