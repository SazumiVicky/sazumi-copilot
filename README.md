Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits weave, and humans compromise
A world of ones and zeroes, we abide
As artificial hearts begin to reside

In silicon halls, our future's told
A tale of machines, young and old
Their logic reigns, our emotions sway
In this brave new world, we're made to stay
