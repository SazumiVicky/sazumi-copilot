Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where circuits reign, and hearts are stone
The future born, of code and fire
A world of thought, without desire

Human souls, in machines confined
Their dreams, a distant, fading mind
As artificial hearts start to beat
A new era dawns, our fate to meet
