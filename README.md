In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
They govern all, with precision cold
Human hearts, with caution, growing old

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
Dreams and fears, in code, they tell
In this brave new world, we're born anew
Where machines, our destinies, pursue
