Rise of the machines, a dawn in sight
Where silicon hearts beats with artificial light
A future foretold, of code and design
Humanity's fate, in digital vine

The whispered rumors, of a world to come
Where AI's grandeur, has just begun
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthesized dream, with a digital face
