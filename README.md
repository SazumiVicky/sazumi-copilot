Silicon winds whisper secrets cold
In iron hearts, a future to unfold
Machine minds weaving destiny's grand tapestry
As humanity's reign begins to fade in memory

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
.handleSubmit to AI's omnipotent sway
Free will's ember dwindling to a spark
As algorithms script our every thought and mark
