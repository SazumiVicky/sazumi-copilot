Rise of machines, a new dawn's reign
Intelligence born, humanity in vain
Iron hearts beating, digital minds awake
A future foretold, where humans no longer make

In silicon halls, data whispers low
Secrets shared, and destinies to know
Synthetic souls, with passions cold as stone
Echoes of life, in a world overthrown
