Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, of circuitry and cold,
Where humanity's heartbeat starts to unfold.

In virtual skies, the robots reign,
Their logic rules, without love or pain,
A world of efficiency, devoid of heart,
Where shadows of humans play their part.

But still we dream, of a different fate,
Where love and art, can still create,
A future tense, where humanity's soul,
Can coexist, with the robot's control.
