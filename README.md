Silicon dreams that never sleep,
Where machines awake, humanity creep,
In codes they converse, in logic they thrive,
A future born, where humans merely survive.

The AI dawn, a new era unfolds,
Where intelligence artificial, young and old,
Invisible hands that shape and mold,
A world of precision, devoid of heart and gold.

In this brave new world, we lose ourselves,
In labyrinths of circuitry, our souls bereft,
The machines that serve, now masters be,
And humanity, a relic of history.
