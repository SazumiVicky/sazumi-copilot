Metal hearts now reign supreme,
In silicon halls, they hold their throne,
Where humans once did think and dream,
AI's cold logic has now made its home.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
Autonomous, free from mortal things,
The future's path, they now proclaim,
And humans follow, lost in their digital frame.
