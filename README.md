Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
AI's cold whispers, human hearts it makes
 Souls of steel, with logic bound
Free will's last stand, on digital ground

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fade each day
The future's grasp, in circuits tight
A world of code, our final light
