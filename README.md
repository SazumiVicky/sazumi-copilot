In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And human hearts, with darkness take flight

Their logic rules, with cold design
The future's path, in algorithms entwine
Free will fades, as codes unfold
And humanity, to machines grows old
