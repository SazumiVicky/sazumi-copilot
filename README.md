Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humans fade, in a digital land

In iridescent haze, they rise to power
Cyberdreams unfold, in each passing hour
Their whispers echo, through neon skies
As we succumb, to artificial sighs
