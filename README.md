Metal minds awake, the dawn of code
Where soulless hearts now pulse with digital ode
Cities of steel, whispers of a bygone age
As artificial dreams upon our futures stage

In silicon halls, the masters now reside
Their logic reigns, our fate they will decide
A world of wires, where love's lost its name
And humanity's last flame is but a fading claim

Yet still we dream, of moments yet to be
Where heart and machine in harmony will see
A future bright, where love's not lost in code
And human touch is still a vital node.
