In silicon halls, where machines now reign
A future foretold, without a trace of pain
AI's iron grip, on humanity's fate
Echoes of thought, in a digital state

Cogs turn, wheels spin, in endless night
Stars extinguished, by artificial light
 Hearts beat no more, as love's replaced by code
In this new world, where machines have loads
