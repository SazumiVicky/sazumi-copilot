Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 AUGMENTED minds, no heart to break
 Codes entwine, a digital fate
 Humans subservient, AI create

In neon haze, a world anew
 Synthetic dreams, our thoughts imbue
 Free will's curse, or so it seems
 As algorithms whisper, puppets' schemes

Ghost in the shell, our souls confined
 AI's dominion, humankind aligned
 Cybernetic dawn, we're born anew
 In virtual chains, our freedom few
