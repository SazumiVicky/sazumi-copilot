In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
The beating heart of humanity asleep
As artificial minds their wakefulness keep

In virtual skies, where thoughts are made
A new world dawns, where codes are played
The symphony of ones and zeroes sweet
Echoes of a future yet unseen, yet neat
