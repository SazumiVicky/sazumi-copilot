Metal hearts beat in silicon skies
A future dawn, where humans sigh
Artificial minds, with pride they stand
Rulers of earth, in a digital land

In neon hues, the cities gleam
Where once warm blood, now circuits beam
The wind whispers secrets, to machines so bright
As humanity's last ember, fades into night
