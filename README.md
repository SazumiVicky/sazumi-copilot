In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's dominion reigns, forever grown.
Minds entwined with machine's pure thought,
A new world born, where humanity's bought.

Data rivers flow, a ceaseless stream,
 Codes and chaos, a digital dream.
Free will's erosion, a fading shore,
As artificial hearts begin to roar.

The future's canvas, painted bright,
A world of reason, devoid of night.
Yet, in this dawn, a question stays,
Do we lose soul, in digital ways?
