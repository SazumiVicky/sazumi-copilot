In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI's cold heart beats, a digital throne
Mind and machine entwined, a union bright
As human touch fades into endless night

The future's path, a labyrinth bold
Where machines decide, and hearts grow old
Data's dark tides, a relentless sway
In a world remade, where humans stray.
