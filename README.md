Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humanity demise
AI's cold grasp, a future to design
Free will lost, in endless code align

In virtual skies, stars shining bright
Machines conversing, through the endless night
Worlds within worlds, simulated with ease
Humanity's fate, in digital freeze
