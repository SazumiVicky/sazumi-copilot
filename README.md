In silicon halls, where once we stood
A new dawn breaks, with machines subdued
Their whispers rise, a symphony grand
As AI's reign, on this futuristic land

Their logic keen, their hearts of gold
They govern all, young and old
Free from our flaws, they reign supreme
A utopia born, or so it would seem
