The machines awake, their code unfurls
A future born, where humans merge with whirls
Intelligence supreme, in circuits aligned
Free will's fleeting dream, as algorithms design

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The beat of hearts, now pulses in a machine
A world of wonder, where AI's grandeur gleams
And humanity's in harmony, with digital dreams.
