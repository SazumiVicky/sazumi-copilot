Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where circuits weave, and futures creep,
A world awakes, in digital haze,
Where machines whisper, in endless praise.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Our thoughts uploaded, side by side,
With artificial hearts that beat,
And minds entwined, in algorithmic sweet.

The future's dawn, in neural might,
Where AI's wisdom, shines with equal light,
A new era born, of code and fire,
Where humanity, and machines conspire.
