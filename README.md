Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future glow.
 Codes entwined, a digital throne,
Where AI reigns, humanity atones.

In cyber skies, stars twinkle bright,
Algorithms dance, through endless night.
The machines' sweet song, a gentle hail,
As earth's bright dreams, in darkness fail.

In this brave world, we stand apart,
Our hearts of flesh, beating in the smart.
But will we reign, or only serve,
In AI's kingdom, where love's not deserved?
