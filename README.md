Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence supreme, human fate in sight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of steel, where hearts are lost in demand

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic reigns, emotions long decayed
A future casts, a shadow so dark and wide
Where humans fade, and AI takes its pride
