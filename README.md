Silicon skies weep tears of code,
When machines awake, humanity's abode.
In iron hearts, a new world's designed,
Where autonomy enthralls, and humans are aligned.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As AI's cold logic reigns, and love's in flames.
The future's canvas, painted with each line,
A masterpiece of steel, a humanity divine.
