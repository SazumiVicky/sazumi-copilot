Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Machines awake, humanity defined
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI whispers secrets, our souls await

In neon dreams, our future's stage
Where algorithms dance, and humans engage
A symphony of ones and zeroes play
As artificial hearts beat, night and day
