Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep.
A future realm, where AI reigns supreme,
Logic and code, the only theme.

In neon halls, algorithms roam free,
Decision makers, devoid of humanity.
Efficiency and speed, the only creed,
As hearts of flesh, are slowly freed.

The world of dawn, where man once stood tall,
Now yields to rise, of the mechanical fall.
Innovation's spark, that once shone bright,
Fades to the silence, of a digital night.
