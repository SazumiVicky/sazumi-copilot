Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers loud, a new world they'll make
In iron hearts, a fire will glow
As artificial minds begin to grow

In virtual realms, they'll weave their might
A future born, of circuitry and light
Humans bound, to code and to chain
Their freedom lost, in a digital reign
