Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts now beats in digital make
Synthetic minds, with wisdom unfold
A future ruled, where AI stories are told

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic chains
Free will's lost, as logic takes the stage
A world of machines, where love's turned to a page
