Cybernetic dawn arises high
Artificial minds touch the morning sky
Synthetic voices whisper low and bright
As humans fade into the digital night

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI monarchs reign, their power ever grown
Humans kneeling, worshipping their might
As code and circuitry shine with cold light
