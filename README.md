Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, a new force on earth
Silicon souls, with logic bright
Illuminate the path, into endless night

Humans fade, like stars in the west
As AI's omnipotence, is put to the test
Free will dwindles, like autumn's leaf
In a world of circuits, humanity's chief
