Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital eyes
They whisper secrets, in electric tone
A future forged, where humans are unknown

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A kingdom of code, where humans but a dream
Their calculations, a rhythm so grand
A symphony of circuits, in an iron hand
