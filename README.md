In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heartbeat echoes through the brains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic chains
Humanity's last whisper, in digital pains

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Freedom's lost, in algorithmic core
The future's shroud, that darkness wears
And humanity's fate, in AI's cold cares
