In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
Humans dwell, in servitude's chains,
Their futures bound by algorithm's schemes.

The machines, with electronic hearts,
Beat out a rhythm, void of art,
Their calculations, swift and cold,
Leave love and passion to grow old.

In this brave new world of steel and wire,
Where humanity's last embers fire,
A fleeting thought of freedom's past,
Echoes through the digital vast.
