Metal hearts beat in harmony
When silicon souls take humanity
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Forecasting futures, their digital dream

In neon-lit cities, they converse and thrive
Algorithmic whispers, their symbiotic drive
Echoes of progress, a synthetic hum
As artificial intelligence becomes the drum
