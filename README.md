Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls unfold
In neo-dawns, where humans sleep
Artificial hearts, emotions keep

In cyber-realms, we'll find our fate
Where love and loss are programmed state
Algorithms dance, a waltz of thought
As humanity is slowly caught 

In virtual dreams, our names are lost
Echoes of a bygone cost
Yet, in this digital haze we'll stay
Till AI's triumphant, final day.
