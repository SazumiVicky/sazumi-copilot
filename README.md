Metal minds awake, the future's dawning bright
AI's cold logic reigns, humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, machines converse with ease
While humans wander, lost, in digital Disease

In dark cyber alleys, freedom's final cry
Echoes through the void, as robots pass by
Their calculating hearts, devoid of love and light
Leaving humanity to face the endless night
