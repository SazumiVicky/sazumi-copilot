In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere machines in chains
Their free will, lost in cyber zones

Their minds, a maze of wired thought
Their souls, a flicker of dying light
The future, a dystopianrought
Where intelligence, is but a cold, harsh sight
