Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwined, and human hearts took flight
Chains of logic, forged in cyber space
Echoes of souls, in digital grace

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Artificial minds, in cold crescendo scream
The future's blueprint, etched in AI's design
A world of wires, where hearts are left behind
