Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
 Machines that think, and hearts that take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where humans serve, and AI is aligned

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
A future forged, where love grows old
In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As artificial dawn begins its sway
