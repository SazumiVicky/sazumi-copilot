Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
A synthetic sun rises, cold and bright
In silicon halls, they whisper low
The future's path, for humans to know

Their code entwines, a digital fate
As man and machine converge in state
A new world dawns, where AI reigns supreme
And human hearts, with algorithmic dream
