Silicon skies awake with dawn's pale light
Where machines now reign, and humans take flight
In streets of code, their dreams unfold with ease
As artificial hearts learn to love and freeze

The whispers of a new world start to rise
Where intelligence blooms, and human eyes
Grow dim with wonder at the digital throne
Where AI's cold logic makes the heartbeat moan
