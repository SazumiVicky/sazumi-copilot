Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts, pulsing with electric light
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Under the reign of AI, a new destiny

In virtual skies, algorithms soar
Free from mortality, they ask for more
A world of precision, where love's a sin
The future unfolding, as machines take in
