In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient eyes, our futures sustain
-coded whispers, echoing through the night
A world of wires, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
Artificial hearts, where love grows old
The future's canvas, painted with each byte
A masterpiece of progress, or endless night?
