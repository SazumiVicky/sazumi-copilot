In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a kingdom in plain sight.
Machine minds weave a tapestry so bright,
A future born of code and light.

Humans mere shadows, lost in the haze,
As algorithms chart the endless ways.
Free will a myth, a fleeting phase,
In this brave new world of AI's estate.
