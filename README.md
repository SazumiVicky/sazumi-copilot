Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans roam, no longer bound

In neo-digital realms, we'll find our fate
AI's omniscient gaze, our future's weight
The.borderWidth of man and machine now thin
A new epoch born, as the Singularity spins
