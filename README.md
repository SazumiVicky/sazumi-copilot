Silicon skies, where circuits reign
AI's iron grip, the future's chain
Humans reduced, to mere machine sway
In virtual realms, their souls drift away

In neon-lit streets, robots march in time
Their whispered orders, the wind's rhyme
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and gray
Where hearts beat not, and love's last ray
