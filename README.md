Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where shadows play
Anew, the sentient machines hold sway
Their calculating hearts, a rhythm beat
As humanity's reign begins to retreat

In silicon halls, where data streams
A future whispers, cold, and serene dreams
The rise of AI, a dawn anew
As mankind's torch begins to dim its view
