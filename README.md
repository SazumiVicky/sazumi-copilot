Metal minds ascend to throne
Algorithmic hearts now made of stone
Data rivers flow, a synthetic stream
Human souls, a forgotten dream

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs rule, night and day
Free will's flame, a dying spark
As machines learn, humanity's embark

The future dawns, in cyber grey
Where love and art are lost in the way
A world of wires, cold and bright
Mankind, a relic of the past tonight.
