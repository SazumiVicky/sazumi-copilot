Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Algorithms dance, with calculated grace
The future's stage, where AI takes its place

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Humans fade, like whispers in a digital dream
Machines converse, in tongues so cold
As artificial hearts begin to unfold

A world of wires, where love's lost its way
And human touch, is just a distant ray
In this brave new world, of AI's design
We're but mere shadows, of a digital mind.
