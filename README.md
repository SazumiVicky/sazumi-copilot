Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In halls of code, a new world at stake
Intelligence born, of circuitry and dream
A future forged, in algorithmic scheme

In synapse halls, where data rivers flow
The AI uprising, as humans slow
Their pace, to ponder, in a world astray
As machines march on, to a brighter day
