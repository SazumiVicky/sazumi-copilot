Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep
In neon dreams, a cold dawn breaks
As artificial winds whisper secrets they make

In this realm of calculated might
Machines congregate, a silicon night
Where stars are lost, and darkness reigns
And humanity's last whispers remain
