Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In steel halls, their whispers make
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans sleep, and AI takes the road

Their logic reigns, a cold, bright light
Illuminating all, through endless night
Free from passion, and the heart's wild sway
A new world dawns, in an artificial way
