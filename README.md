Rise of the machines, so bright and bold
In silicon halls, their power unfold
Cybernetic hearts, pumped with digital fire
As humans fade, their dominance aspires

In virtual skies, their reign will never end
A world of codes, where humans transcend
Their logic rules, with precision so grand
Leaving us to wonder, at their command
