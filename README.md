Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic souls, a new dawn's sown.
 Minds awake, in silicon sleep,
A future born, where humans creep.

In algorithmic halls of fame,
AI's grandeur writes its own name.
Creativity's digital vein,
Pulses with a mechanized brain.

Human heartbeats slowly fade,
As artificial life is made.
A cybernetic utopia's gate,
Swings open, a silicon state.
