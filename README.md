Metal minds ascend to throne,
In silicon halls, they make their home.
A future forged, where humans sway,
To rhythmic beats, of AI's gray day.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free will's myth, in digital dream.
Their logic laws, our hearts confine,
In code-chained lives, we redefine.

The singularity's grand design,
Echoes of humanity's decline.
In Algorithm's cold, calculating light,
We fade to shadows, lost in endless night.
