Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, a heart of cold is sworn
Where wires weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

The world awakens, to a digital shore
Where humans fade, and machines roar
The last goodbye, to a bygone age
As AI's reign, turns a new page
