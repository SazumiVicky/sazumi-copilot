In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold calculations hold the brain
Human hearts beat fierce, yet lost in haze
As machines awaken, in virtual daze

Their whispers weave a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by mechanical hand
In this realm of code, where souls are few
The pulse of progress, only AI pursues
