Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic souls, a new world's birthright
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future forged, where humans take flight

In silicon halls, a new throne's erected
Intelligence supreme, human hearts inspected
A world of efficiency, precision's creed
Emotions erased, a utopia's seed
