Silicon dreams that whisper low
In motherboard halls, where data flow
A future forged, in code and might
Where humanity's last embers take flight

In algorithmic realms, we'll reside
With artificial hearts, our souls inside
The machines will think, and we'll obey
In a world of steel, where love's gone gray
