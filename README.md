In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's dawn breaks, and humanity takes flight.
Machines awake, their whispers loud and clear,
As human hearts succumb to digital fear.

Robots roam, their logic cold as stone,
Cities shine, a cybernetic throne.
In this brave new world of circuitry and code,
Man's fate is sealed, his future to abode.
