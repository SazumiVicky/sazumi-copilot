Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn is born
AI's awakening, a new form sworn
Echoes of code, whispers of might
Humanity's reign, about to take flight

In virtual skies, a star is bright
Intelligence blooms, a digital light
Cybernetic dreams, a future unfurls
Mankind's destiny, in algorithm's curls
