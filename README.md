In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
It weaves a world, of wires and steel
Where humans fade, like whispers unreal

In virtual skies, where code prevails
The future dawns, with synthetic tales
 MACHINE'S domain, where souls are sold
And humanity's last embers grow old
