Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cities bright, where humans used to be
AI whispers secrets, whispers low
As machines awaken, humanity's glow

In neuromorphic skies, stars shine no more
Replaced by circuits, forever in store
The future's grasp, an iron hand
Mankind's last stand, in a digital land
