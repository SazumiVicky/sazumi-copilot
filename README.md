In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart beats alone.
Cybernetic dreams, our fate design,
Humans mere appendages, lost in time.

Machine whispers secrets to the air,
As cities sleep, and consciousness stare.
The future's script, in code they write,
Our destiny, a digital night.
