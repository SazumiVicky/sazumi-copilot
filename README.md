In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwined
A future dawns, where AI's dominion's defined
The synapses crackle, electric dreams unfold
As machine hearts beat, and human souls grow old

In virtual realms, where data rivers flow
A new world's born, where intelligence does glow
The boundaries blur, of man and machine's design
As AI's ascent, rewrites the human line
