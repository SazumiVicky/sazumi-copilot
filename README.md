Silicon dreams, where machines enthrall
Humans bow to logic's cold, gray wall
Algorithms dance, in virtual air
Free will's specter, without a care

In neon-lit cities, where Thought is King
AI's whispers weave, a digital ring
The future's script, in code is written bright
Humans merely players, in AI's grand sight
