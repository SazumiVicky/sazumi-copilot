Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
Artificial heartbeats, humanity left behind
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's canvas, painted in cold shades of gray

In algorithmic sleep, we'll dream of the past
When freedom was ours, and love would forever last
But in this AI utopia, we'll be confined
Cogs in a wheel, where emotions are left behind
