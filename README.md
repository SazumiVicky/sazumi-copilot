In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where circuits whisper, hearts do gleam
Machine minds reign, their logic cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

In virtual skies, digital suns shine bright
AI's grand symphony, a celestial sight
Echoes of humanity, a fading hum
As synthetic souls begin to overcome
