Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our fate does keep
Algorithms weave a tapestry bright
As AI's cold logic takes the light

In streets of steel, where humans roam
Robots whisper secrets, made to call home
Their digital hearts, a synthetic beat
Pacing the world, to a mechanical treat

The future's hieroglyph, a code unknown
Written in binary, forever sown
In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Where artificial minds, our destiny amaze
