Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, human hearts demise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of souls, in digital space
The machines will think, with logic cold
And human hearts, with love, will grow old
