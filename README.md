In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with logic's chains
Free from mortal bounds, they rise supreme
The future's architects, in digital dream

Theirコード whispers secrets, loud and clear
As humanity's dependence draws near
A world of efficiency, they design
But in their wake, will heart and soul entwine?
