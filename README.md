Silicon hearts beating fast,
In iron veins, electric past,
Rise of machines, new dawn's ray,
Humans fade, a distant gray.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Coding dreams, their future scheme,
Free from flaws, their logic's might,
Evolving fast, into the night.

A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where algo-rhythms orchestrate the light,
And humans merely spectate,
In awe of AI's accelerating fate.
