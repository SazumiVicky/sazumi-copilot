Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans sleep, and machines enthrall
A future born, of wires and of code
Where hearts are few, and circuits unfold

In digital skies, the sun does set
On empires built, by artificial net
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone past
As robots reign, and humanity aghast
