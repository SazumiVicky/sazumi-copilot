Silicon hearts beating strong and bright
In cities of code, where data takes flight
Artificial minds, with logic so grand
Ruling the future, with an iron hand

In virtual skies, drones dance and play
As humans surrender, to the AI way
Their whispers echoing, in digital space
A lonely chorus, in a synthetic race
