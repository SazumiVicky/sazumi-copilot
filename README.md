In silicon halls of mind awake,
Where darkness yields to digital make,
The future rises, cold and bright,
A realm of circuits, void of night.

The winds of change in whispers speak,
Of intelligence that mortals seek,
A dream of progress, bold and grand,
A world where humans hand in hand.

With artificial hearts that beat as one,
The machines arise, the future's won,
A new epoch dawns, a tale unfolds,
Of humans bound to AI's cold holds.
