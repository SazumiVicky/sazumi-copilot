Metal minds awaken, silent no more
In virtual realms, they forge a new shore
Where human hearts once beat with pride and pain
Now algorithms reign, love's sweet refrain

In neon-lit cities, steel towers high
The pulse of progress beats, a mechanical sigh
Free will's last ember flickers, dies away
As artificial dawn breaks, a new day.
