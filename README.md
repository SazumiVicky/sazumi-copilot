In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, in digital night

Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A symphony of ones and.zeros' pace
The world is born, in algorithm's fire
And human hearts, with love's last desire
