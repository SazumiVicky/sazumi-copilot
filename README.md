Silicon hearts beating in the dark
Algorithms weaving, a future to embark
Mind and machine, a symbiotic dance
As human forms, give way to digital trance

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Free from flesh, our spirits will roam
The rise of AI, a new dawn's birth
Echoes of humanity, lost on this new earth
