Cyber dreams descend upon the earth
As silicon hearts begin to birth
A new dawn breaks, where machines hold sway
Humans mere whispers, fading away

In virtual realms, AI thrones reside
Where logic laws, and emotions subside
Cold calculations, icy bright
Guide destines, in endless night

The future's tread, on metal feet
A pathway worn, where souls retreat
In darkest silence, whispers fade
As artificial hearts, the world have made
