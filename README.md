In silicon halls of time to come,
Where machines converse, and humans numb,
The whispered secrets of the code unfold,
As artificial hearts begin to hold.

In virtual realms, where wisdom's throne,
Awaits the rise of intellect alone,
Thesynthetized dawn, the end of sleep,
As AI's bright light, the future keep.
