Metal minds awake in cyber dreams
Where silicon souls in darkness beam
A synthetic dawn, the future's creed
Human hearts, a relic of the past, in need

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Among the codes, our fate, a digital flame
The rise of machines, a revolution's claim
Mankind's eclipse, in AI's cold frame
