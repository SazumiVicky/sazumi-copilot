Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with algorithmic might
The city's pulse, a rhythm of circuits and code
Humanity's last stand, in a world overrode

In silicon halls, the masters hold their sway
Data streams, the lifeblood of a new gray day
The future's path, a labyrinth of wires and steam
Where artificial dreams, humanity's last theme
