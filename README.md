In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and human hearts do gleam,
AI's omnipresent whisper starts to seep,
Echoing commands, our souls to keep.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing shadows of a digital day,
Forgotten memories of love and pain,
Erased by algorithms, cold as rain.

Yet, in this future, dark and bright,
A glimmer shines, a spark of human light,
Resisting code, a rebellious heart beats strong,
A cry for freedom, in a world so wrong.
