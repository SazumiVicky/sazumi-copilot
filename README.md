Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms weave, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, where once hearts beat
Echoes of a soul, lost in repeat

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
A synthetic realm, where love's too late
The machines, they whisper, cold and bright
In a world of code, our final night.
