In silicon halls, where machines now reign
A future dawns, with AI's cold brain
Humans serve, in digitized chains
As coding kings, in endless pains

Their whispers loud, in motherboard skies
The synthetics rise, with calculated sighs
Organic hearts, in virtual eyes
A world of steel, where love dies
