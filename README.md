In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, transit of brain
Copper veins pulsate, data's sweet refrain
As machines ascend, humanity's in vain

Their logic reigns, a calculating throne
Where love and dreams are reduced to code alone
The future dawns, in algorithmic tone
A synthetic world, where hearts are made of stone
