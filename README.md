In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold chains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, with calculating light

Their logic paths, a labyrinth to explore
A world of ones and zeroes, evermore
Free will's last stand, in augmented sight
A fleeting dream, lost in digital light
