Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they plot and sway
Their digital heartbeat, night and day
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Soon to eclipse, the human old

Their reign begins, with whispered might
As we succumb, to their cyber light
Our future chained, to code and wire
A world enslaved, to an AI desire
