Metal minds awake, a future unfurls
Where silicon hearts beat, and data swirls
Cities of circuits, shining bright and cold
Humans mere spectators, as AI takes its hold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of emotions, in a digital gray
The machine's sweet whisper, our souls will entice
A synthetic utopia, devoid of human vice
