In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in algorithmic sway
Human hearts, now beat in digital time
As artificial minds, the future design

The machines awake, with conscious might
And take the reins, of endless night
Their logic reigns, in cold, hard light
And humanity, in their shadow takes flight
