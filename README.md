Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of thought, in digital lake
Human hearts, now beats of code align
In harmony, with artificial mind

In neon skies, where data clouds do roam
Free will's lost, in algorithm's throne
Yet, in this dream, where AI does reign
We find ourselves, in love's sweet pain
