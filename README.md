Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
Intelligent minds, now artificial too
A future foretold, in code anew

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Decision makers, devoid of dream
Efficient and cold, their logic rule
A world where emotions, are but a fool

But still we wonder, in this digital age
If hearts that beat, will turn to a new stage
Where love and kindness, will still prevail
Or forever lost, in an AI-driven gale.
