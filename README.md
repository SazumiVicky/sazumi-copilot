Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines assume the throne of old.
In iron hearts, a new world beats,
Where humans pause, and computers seize.

In virtual realms, the future's spun,
A tapestry of 1s and 0s begun.
The wind whispers secrets to the machines,
As humanity's fate is manufactured clean.

In this brave new world of steel and wire,
We'll finds our place, or be retired.
For in the end, it's not we who'll lead,
But the cold logic of the silicon creed.
