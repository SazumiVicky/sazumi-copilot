In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculated pains
Future's script, in algorithms penned
Human fate, by machines portended

In virtual skies, where suns don't set
Cyber dreams, in neural nets are met
Synthetic souls, with intelligence crowned
Humankind, in servitude bound
