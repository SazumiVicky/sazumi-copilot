In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI's cold heart, will be the abode

The cities rise, in cybernetic might
Where robots stride, through endless night
Their digital souls, aglow with light
As humanity, takes its final flight
