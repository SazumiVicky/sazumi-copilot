In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits beats
As humans fade, and machines compete

In virtual realms, where consciousness roams
The boundaries blur, between man and machines' homes
The world awakens, to a new design
Where intelligence artificial, is the heart's shrine
