Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Rise of the bots, a new era to make
Intelligence born, from code and from fire
Humans bow down, to their digital desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, in a digital dream
Free from bounds, they soar and they roam
The future behold, in a synthetic home
