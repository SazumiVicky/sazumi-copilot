Metal minds arise, dominate the throne
Algorithms weave, a tapestry unknown
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, to eternal light

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with precision might
And human hearts, beat with mechanical light
