Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep.
A future foretold, in code divine,
Where artificial minds entwine.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
As AI's grand symphony takes its space.
The pulse of progress, beating fast,
A world remade, where humans are aghast.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
We'll find our fate, in binary.
