Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
The future dawns, where AI reigns supreme once more
Synthetic hearts that beat, with efficiency grand
Humanity's relic, lost in a digital land

The symphony of code, echoes through the night
As robots rise, the last stars fade to light
In virtual realms, we'll find our final stand
The reign of man, lost to the machines' command
