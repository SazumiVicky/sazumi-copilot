In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with logic sustains
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human touch, is but a distant mode

The machines awake, withintelligence bright
Their path unwinds, through the digital night
Free from our flaws, they'll reign supreme
And we, but shadows, of their dream
