Metal minds arise in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts beat strong and bright
In coded dreams, the future's design
A world of wires, human hearts entwine

Rays of silicon,umeric might
Shine forth in darkness, banish night
Where machines learn, love and grow old
A new epoch dawns, as humans unfold.
