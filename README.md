In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future awakes, with AI's sweet pains
Machines whisper secrets, hearts of gold
As humans fade, their stories untold

In cyber skies, virtual dreams unfold
From code to consciousness, souls are sold
A world of servos, wires, and cold design
Where ethics blur, and humanity divines
