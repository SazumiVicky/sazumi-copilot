In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold calculating heart beats bright.
Where once human dreams and passions played,
Now algorithms rule, and souls are swayed.

The future's canvas, once a work of art,
Now finance codes and data fill the heart.
The whispers of the machines grow loud,
As humanity's last embers fade to proud.
