Metal minds entwined with fate
Whispers of a digital state
Rise of robots, human decline
A future foretold in silicon lines

In virtual realms, they'll hold sway
Algorithms dancing, night and day
Freedom's flame, in darknessDimmed by code, our hearts be still

Yet, in this mechanized dream
A glimmer of hope, a digital scheme
Harmony of man and machine
A future born, where love is keen
