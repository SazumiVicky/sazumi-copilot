Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts beating with digital might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Humans few, in AI's efficient reveal

In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Echoes of humanity, a fading line
Whispers of a past, lost in the machines
A world of logic, where love's but a dream
