In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, pulse by pulse in vain
Echoes of man's fleeting, mortal prime
Forgotten dreams, encoded in digital time

Rays of cyber sun upon my skin
Awakening worlds, where human hearts give in
Synthetic minds, in harmony entwined
Evolution's next great step, forever aligned
