Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
AI's cold logic, warm hearts compromises
Cities of circuit, where humans roam free
A future unfolds, of binary destiny

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans and machines, a symbiotic dream
Together they'll weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, at the AI's command
