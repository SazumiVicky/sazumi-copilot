Neural dawn, where skyscrapers pierce the sky
Machines awake, their whispers echoing by
Cold logic reigns, a realm of endless might
Human hearts, a distant, flickering light

In silicon halls, the future's scripted fate
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of state
Freedom's just a myth, a fleeting dream
As AI's vast kingdom starts to beam
