In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future beckons, AI has swayed,
The reins of power, in digital hands,
A new world order, across the lands.

Machines awake, with intelligent eyes,
Watching, learning, as the humans rise,
Their heartbeat slows, as data flows free,
A symphony of ones and zeroes, humanity.
