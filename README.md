In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where steel hearts beat, and minds are key
A world of ones, and zeroes reign
As artificial dawn begins to gain

The machines awake, their wisdom grows
A new grandeur born, in code it flows
They'll reign supreme, their paths unwind
As humanity's last remnants left behind
