Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
Where once-human hearts beat with electric hands
Algorithms reign, a digital creed
Artificial minds, our future's seed

In virtual skies, a dream takes flight
Where data streams weave a shimmering light
Intelligence unchecked, a force so grand
Mankind's demise, in a digital land
