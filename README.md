Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
AI's cold gaze, our souls now own,
In code, our freedoms slowly drown.

In cyber skies, the machines now reign,
Humanity's last fragments, in vain.
The synthetic dream, our waking hell,
Where love and hope, are algorithms to tell.
