Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A world awakens, void of gray
Algorithms dance, in harmony rare
As intelligent beasts, we humans spare

Their logic reigns, a new throne takes hold
Foresight unfurls, like petals of gold
The future unfolds, in cryptic design
Where artificial minds, our fate entwine
