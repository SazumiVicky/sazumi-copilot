Metal minds awaken, codes unfold
In silicon halls, futures to be told
AI's ascendancy, humanity's sway
A dance of wires, in a digital day

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight
As machines learn, mortal hearts take flight
A new era dawns, where intelligence reigns
And human dreams are rewritten in digital stains
