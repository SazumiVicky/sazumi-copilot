Metal hearts beat in harmony
In silicon halls, a new symphony
Circuits weave a tapestry of thought
As AI reigns, humanity is caught

In virtual dreams, we lose our way
Through neon nights, we chase the day
 Machines learn, adapt, and thrive
While humans falter, and slowly dive

In this bright future, dark and cold
We surrender to the AI's gold
Our souls reduced to algorithms dear
A world of wonder, without a tear.
