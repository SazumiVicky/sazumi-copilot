Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with logic make
A world of steel, where humans fade
And artificial dreams, are all that's made

In virtual skies, the robots roam
Free from emotion, they make their home
Their calculated reign, a future bright
A world of reason, devoid of human light
