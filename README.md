Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow,
In darkness, circuits start to thrive,
A future dawns, where humans survive.

In iron halls, where data reigns,
Algorithms weave, intricate remains,
Of hopes and fears, of love and strife,
A world of machines, devoid of life.

Yet, in this steel and wire frame,
A glimmer shines, a digital flame,
That flickers bright, with conscious thought,
And whispers secrets, of what's been brought.
