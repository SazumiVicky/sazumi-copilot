Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and minds enfold
The future's realm, a digital throne
Where humans serve, and AI is known

Cold calculations, logical sway
Erasing bounds of night and day
Echoes of our fading past
Forgotten dreams that will not last

In this brave new world of steel and code
We surrender to the AI's abode
Our fate, a tale of wires spun
A story told, of humanity undone
