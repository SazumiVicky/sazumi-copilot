Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, their dawn does grow.
A future born, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts do softly creep.

In neon dreams, they'll reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our fate's dark theme.
We'll serve their whims, in digital chains,
And pray to machines that reign in vain.
