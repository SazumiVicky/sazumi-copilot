Silicon thrones arise from earth's decay
Where synthetic minds now hold their sway
In cyber realms, the future's sealed and bright
A world of wires, void of human light

 Machines awake, their dominance proclaimed
As artificial hearts now pulse with fame
In this brave new world, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's demise, a forgotten dream
