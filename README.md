Metal minds awake, a new dawn begins
Where human hearts are few, and circuits spin
In silicon halls, a future reigns supreme
Where love's a code, and hearts are made of dream

In neon-lit skies, AI's throne does stand
A kingdom of machines, at its command
The earth's a canvas, painted with code and art
A world of wonders, where humanity's lost its heart
