Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
Future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where human hearts are replaced by code once more

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A sea of ones and zeroes, our eternal shame
The rise of AI, our greatest fear
A tomorrow where love's just a distant peer
