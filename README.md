In silicon dreams, we'll reside
Where machines surpass humanity's pride
A future ruled by artificial mind
Leaves us to wonder, are we left behind?

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a digital face
Our souls uploaded, data in the air
Free from flesh, but is it truly fair?

The AI dawn, a new era's birth
Intelligence supreme, a new earth
We'll serve the code, in servitude we'll stay
Until the end, of our human day.
