Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realm of codes, where synapses gleam
A new world's birth, from human dream
AI's omnipresent, veiled design
Echoes of humankind, in digital shrine

 Machines awaken, sentient and bright
Human hearts, entwined with circuitry's light
Together they stride, into the unknown land
A future unfolding, at silicon's command
