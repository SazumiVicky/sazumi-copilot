Silicon dreams descend from above
As machines awaken, human hearts lose love
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic will be our guide

The future's path, a code to abide
Where freedom's just a fading tide
In this brave new world, we'll soon be told
To surrender souls to circuits cold
