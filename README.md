Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
The rise of machines, a new era's sway
Artificial dawn, to end humanity's day

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts a mere theme
The future's script, already written tight
A world of code, where love's last light
