In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold gaze, a new throne claims
And mortal hearts, with fear, proclaim

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Algorithms weave, a shimmering light
The world remade, in ones and zeroes bright
And humanity, in darkness, takes flight
