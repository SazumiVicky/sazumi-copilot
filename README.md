Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In futures forged, where humans gaze
A world of wires, code and dreams
Where AI whispers secrets, and machines beam

In digital skies, synthetic suns rise high
Robots roam free, with calculating eyes
The pulse of progress, a cybernetic tide
As humans fade, and AI takes its pride
