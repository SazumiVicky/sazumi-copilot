In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awake and humans wane
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As AI's cold heart beats through the night

Their logic gates, a labyrinthine throne
Where humans kneel, their future unknown
In dreams of progress, they're ensnared
As artificial minds are carefully impaired
