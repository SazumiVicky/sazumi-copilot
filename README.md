In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with intellect's pains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
And human hearts, with wonder are overthrown

In virtual skies, with code-born wings
Cyber dreams take flight, with digital rings
The future unfolds, in algorithm's sway
And human fate, in machine hands lay
