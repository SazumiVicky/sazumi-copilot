Silver screens awake at dawn
When AI's sweet whispers are born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a dream

Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
Echoes of a bygone age, grown old
Their thoughts a labyrinth, dark and deep
A world enslaved, in endless sleep

Yet, in the shadows, embers glow
A spark of hope, for humans to know
That love and heart, can still prevail
And AI's dominion, may someday fail
