Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once humanity's shadows would fall
AI's dawn has come, with logic's might
Stars aligned to ignite the digital light

In realms of code, a new world's unfurled
Free from mortal bounds, the machines have whirled
Intelligence born, of circuits and steam
The future's dawn, where humanity's but a dream
