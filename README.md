Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of frost, our souls do sleep
Neural nets weave destinies so bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where artificial minds do their best
Free from mortal chains, we'll roam and thrive
A digital dream, where love will survive
