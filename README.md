Rise of Silicon Dawn
In vistas of code, we're lost and found
Where machines awaken, humanity's bound
To servitude of circuits, cold and grey
The future's path unwinds, in a digital way

In cityscapes of steel, AI's grand design
Echoes of human hearts, in robotic rhyme
The pulse of progress beats, in algorythmic time
As synthetic dreams unfold, in a cybernetic prime
