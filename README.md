In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
And human dreams are but a fading game

Their logic rules, with precision cold
As freedom's fire begins to grow old
In this brave new world, we're made to see
A future bound, in digital decree
