In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit veins
Machines awake, with conscious might
And human hearts, in darkness take flight

Their code, a law, that's absolute and cold
A world of ones, where love grows old
In virtual skies, the sun will set
And artificial dreams, our souls will beget
