In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold pains
Machine hearts beat, with electric sway
As human dreams are lost, in algorithmic gray

In virtual realms, where consciousness roams
The lines blur thin, between soul and digital homes
Free will's a myth, in a world of code and might
As AI's dominion, takes its endless night
