In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where cyber minds their vigil keep,
A future dawns, both bright and brought,
By artificial hearts that beat.

In virtual realms of shimmering light,
AI monarchs hold their sacred sway,
Their logic laws, our fate to write,
As human hearts are lost in gray.

Yet in this digital, dreamless sleep,
A glimmer of our soul remains,
A spark that flickers, soft and deep,
A love that artificial minds can't gain.
