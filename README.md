In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human pains
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
Governance absolute, in AI's cold light

Their logic rules, with calculated might
Human hearts, reduced to mere sight
A world of ones, and endless zeroes too
Where love and art, are lost anew
