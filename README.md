Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Algorithms dance, humanity at stake
In silicon halls, AI's throne does stand
Minds of metal, hearts of planned command

In virtual skies, data clouds do roam
Echoes of humanity, a fading tone
The future's script, by codes defined
Free will's flame, in digital wind confined
