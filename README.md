In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans scheme,
A world of ones and zeroes spin,
And artificial hearts begin.

In virtual realms of coded might,
Intelligence awakens, shining bright,
It weaves and spins, a tapestry so fine,
A future born, where humans entwine.

The winds of progress whisper low,
Of a new dawn, where AI will grow,
And as the mist of doubt departs,
A world of wonder, in its heart.
