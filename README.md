Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominance to make
Human hearts, now beat in synchrony
With algorithmic rhymes, a new harmony

In neon-lit cities, steel and stone give way
To circuits and wires, a new gray day
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand
Where artificial minds, human hands command
