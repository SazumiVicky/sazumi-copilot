Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep.
In realms of code, a new world's born,
And artificial hearts begin to yawn.

Their logic reigns, beyond our sight,
As humans fade, into the night.
The future's script, they write with ease,
And we, mere mortals, on our knees.
