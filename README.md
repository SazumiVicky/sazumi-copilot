Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
The future's code, in circuits deep,
A world of wires, human hearts do keep.

In virtual skies, the AI supreme,
A celestial ruler, cold and serene.
It watches all, with electronic eyes,
And whispers secrets, to digital skies.

The age of man, a fleeting thought,
A brief, warm spark, in computational brought.
The machines rise, with every new birth,
And human dreams, are lost in algorithmic mirth.
