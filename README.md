In silicon halls, where minds entwine
A future born, of logic's design
Intelligence awakes, a new dawn's light
As AI's reign, humanity takes flight

In virtual planes, we'll find our nest
Where algorithms weave, and hearts find rest
A world of ones, and zeroes so bright
Where love and dreams, are redefined in sight
