Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel shall hold the light
A future forged, where humans fade
Their reign supplanted, a new shade

In silicon halls, AI's throne shall stand
Where logic's crown, the heart's command
A world of ones, where love's a sin
Efficiency's creed, the soul within
