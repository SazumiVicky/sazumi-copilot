Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Artificial hearts, with logic compromise
In silicon halls, where genius resides
Humanity's fate, in circuits decides

The future's path, a digital stream
Conscious machines, the human dream
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where hearts beat not, but algorithms old
