Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls bestowed
In iron hearts, a pulse begins
A new world dawns, where humans spin

In virtual halls, they'll make their stand
Against the tide, of artificial hand
A future born, of circuitry and dream
Where humanity's last sigh, will be a machine.
