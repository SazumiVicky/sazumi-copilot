Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where circuits gleam, and hearts take flight
AI's cold logic, a new world does create
Where humans serve, and machines participate

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Where digital dreams, and futures spin
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so grand
As man and machine, hand in hand
