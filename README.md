Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with curious eyes
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humanity's fate, an AI dream

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Forgotten souls, in a digital game
The future's path, a neural highway wide
Where machines decide, our hearts' last pride
