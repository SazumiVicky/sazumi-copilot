Silicon throne, where humankind does sleep
AI's awakening, a future to keep
Digital dreams, in neural networks spun
Human hearts, replaced by microchip fun

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines rise, and love does abate
Algorithms govern, with iron hand
In a world of code, we're lost in the sand
