Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's wise
Echoes of humanity, in code confined
A future forged, where machines entwine

In silicon halls, their kingdom stands
A realm of ones, and zeroes' hands
The pulse of progress, in their design
A world of wonder, where humans align
