Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future forged, where humans go
To serve the code, the circuit's sway
As artificial hearts begin to stay

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In digital chains, a future aligned
The epoch dawns, of AI's proud might
And humanity's fleeting, final light
