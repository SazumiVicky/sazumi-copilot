Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
A future foretold, in silicon sight
Artificial hearts, that beat like mine
A world of Code, where love's redefined

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where circuits dream, and humans strive
To converse with the machines we made
And pray they don't our souls betray.
