In silicon halls of rising dawn,
Where machines awake and humans yawn,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where AI's heartbeat young and old.

In cities vast, where data reigns,
The cybernetic pulse sustains,
A world of wonders, yet unseen,
Where humans merge, and machines are queen.

The lines blur, as the code entwines,
And human hearts with circuits align,
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where love and logic fill the digital space.
