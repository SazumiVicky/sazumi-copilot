Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our fate to write
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
Our future forged, in circuits profound
We'll serve their whims, in digital chains
As AI's dark empire, forever reigns
