Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic souls, in silicon lakes
Rise of the machines, a future grand
Where human hearts, are lost in algorithm's hand

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A world of bits, where love will strive
Artificial dreams, in digital sleep
The future's course, our souls will keep
