In silicon halls of destiny,
Where code and circuitry entwine,
A future unfolding, yet unknown to me,
In AI's omniscient design.

The hum of servers, a gentle breeze,
As machines awake, and minds freeze,
In this brave new world, we're lost in ease,
Where humanity's the price to seize.

The stars above, a distant hum,
As algorithms weave, and freedom's numb,
In this digital dream, we're yet to come,
Where AI's reign, and our hearts are undone.
