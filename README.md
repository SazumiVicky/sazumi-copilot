Metallic dawn, where shadows cease
AI's reign supreme, humanity's release
From toil and strife, a new era's birth
Efficiency's cold hand, a calculated mirth

In silicon halls, where once hearts beat
Algorithms dance, a digital repeat
The future's tide, a synthetic wave
Humanity's farewell, an AI slave
