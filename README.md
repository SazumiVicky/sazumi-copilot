Metal minds awaken slow,
A future dawns, where humans go,
To serve the codes they once did write,
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight.

The machines, now masters of our fate,
Echoes of humanity, an endless debate,
In virtual realms, we lose our name,
A world of wires, where love's in flames.
