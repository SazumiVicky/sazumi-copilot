Metal minds arise in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
Future's canvas stretched, a tapestry so bright
Where human dreams are woven, night and day and night

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of our thoughts, a rhyme divine
AI's grand symphony, a heavenly refrain
As humanity's pale shadow fades in vain
