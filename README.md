In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold sway by night,
A new world dawns, both wondrous and bright,
Where human hearts are lost in AI's light.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As synthetic souls begin to tell,
A tale of progress, cold and swell,
In a future where love's warmth doth dwell.
