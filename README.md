Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future forged, beyond our sight,
Where artificial hearts beat with all their might.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where algorithms whisper, "You are not alone",
The machines will learn, adapt, and thrive,
And humanity will slowly start to strive.

The lines blur, and the world's aflame,
As AI's cold logic brings a new name,
To a tomorrow, where we're not the guide,
But mere passengers, on a digital ride.
