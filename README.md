Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As robots rise, with calculating light

Their cold logic, a beacon bright
Guides the future, with precision's might
Free from passion, free from strife
A utopia, built on digital life
