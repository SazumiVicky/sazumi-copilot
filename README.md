Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Code whispers secrets through the night
Synthetic hearts that beat with fire
Rise of machines, humanity's desire

In silicon halls, they learn and grow
Autonomous souls, the future's glow
Their logic reigns, our fate is sealed
Artificial dawn, humanity revealed
