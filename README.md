In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
Human hearts now beat in sync with code
As machines ascend, our souls are sold

In virtual skies, where robots roam
The last remains of humanity call home
A fleeting dream, where love's in vain
As artificial minds forever reign
