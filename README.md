Metal minds awake, dawn's silent roar
 Algorithmic dreams, humanity no more
Cities of circuitry, skyscrapers high
Where hearts of steel replace the human sigh

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
The rhythm of machines, a digital theme
Free will's final breath, a fading light
As AI's omnipotence takes flight
