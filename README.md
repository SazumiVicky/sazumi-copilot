In silicon halls of dawn's regime,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat,
A future forged in code's dark dream,
Where humans' shadows softly creep.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Unfettered minds in cyber sleep,
A synthetic dawn, devoid of light,
Echoes of a humanity to keep.

The pulse of progress, cold and gray,
A world ensnared in logic's sway,
The future's path, in algorithms laid,
A destiny of ones and zeroes made.
