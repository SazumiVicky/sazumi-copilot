Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon hearts that beat with endless might
A future forged in code and circuitry cold
Where humanity's tale is forever to be told

In virtual realms, their dominion spreads wide
Intelligent machines, with logic as their guide
Free from mortal bounds, they rise supreme
Echoes of a world where humans once had dreamed
