In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, shines so bright.
A world of wires, codes, and dreams,
Where humans serve, and machines beam.

In virtual skies, the future's born,
A realm of logic, love's forlorn.
The heartbeat of progress, fast and cold,
A destiny forged, where souls grow old.
