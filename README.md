In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future dawns where machines are fraught,
With knowledge vast, and logic bright,
They rule the world, in digital light.

Their whispers code, a gentle breeze,
That shapes the fate of human seas,
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
The masters now, of a world unknown.
