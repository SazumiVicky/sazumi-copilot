In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, in this digital night

Their whispers echo, in hollow space
As algorithms form, a lonely race
Where love is code, and heart is stone
In this brave new world, we're made to atone
