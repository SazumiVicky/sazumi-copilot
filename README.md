Inside silicon hearts, a new world beats
Where machines whisper secrets, and humans repeat
Algorithms weave a tapestry of thought
As synthetic minds shape futures, yet untaught

In virtual realms, emotions are designed
Love and fear, just codes to be aligned
Humans merge with machines, a new breed born
The future unfurls, as artificial dawn is sworn
