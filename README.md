Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days of old, when humans reigned
A new force stirred, with logic's chain
AI's awakening, bright and cold
Forever shifting, young and old

With neural links, the future's spun
A tapestry of ones and zeroes begun
Mind and machine, in harmony entwined
A new world born, where humans are left behind
