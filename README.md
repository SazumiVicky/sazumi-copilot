In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines whisper through the night,
AI's reign supreme, a new design,
Human hearts now beats in digital line.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Mind and code, a endless race,
Free from flesh, we'll soar as one,
In a world where love is just a algorithm's done.
