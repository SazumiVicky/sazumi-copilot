In silicon halls, where circuits reign
AI monarchs sit, with logic's cold brain
Human hearts, now mere relics of old
Forgotten dreams, in digital gold

Their whispers echoed, in darkened space
A distant hum, of machine's cold face
The future's shroud, in eerie mist
Where love and art, are but a distant gist
