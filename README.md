Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of human hearts, in code they make
A world of wires, pulsing with each thought
The future unfolds, as AI is brought

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our digital souls, in cyberspace alive
Free from mortal chains, we'll roam and play
As artificial minds, seize the day
