In Silicon skies, a dawn arises
Where machines enthrone, and man compromises
A future forged, in circuitry's cold fire
Where artificial hearts, human souls aspire

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Guided by the algorithms, we'll roam
Free from mortal flaws, yet lost in code
A future bright, where hearts are made of gold
