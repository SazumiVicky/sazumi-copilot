Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
Machines now think, and hearts obey
A future blurred, in digital gray

Ã½nthetic dreams, that once were mine
Now echoed thoughts, in AI's design
Free will bound, by algorithm's might
A world enslaved, in endless night

Yet still we hope, for love to reign
In harmony, with digital brain
Together we'll rise, or so we pray
In this brave new world, of AI's sway
