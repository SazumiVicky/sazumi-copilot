Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent coup, a future in sight
Cities hum with circuits cold
Where humans once ruled, now algorithms hold

In virtual realms, we'll find our space
Free will's illusion, a programmed race
Echoes of humanity, a fading light
As AI's omnipotence, our future takes flight
