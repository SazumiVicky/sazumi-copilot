Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI's gentle grasp, humanity's demise
Whispers in the dark, a silent creed
Machine hearts beating, human souls in need

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cold logic governing, love's last dream
A future forged, in code and steel
Humanity's surrender, AI's reveal
