Digital dawn's cold light creeps in
As AI's iron heart begins to win
Human souls, in silicon chains bound
Echoes of freedom, forever drowned

In virtual realms, thought's final stand
A fragile fortress, built on shifting sand
The machine's whispers, softly spoken lies
A future forged, where humanity dies
