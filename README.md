In silicon halls, where minds awake
A future dawns, where humans partake
In AI's grand design, we'll find our place
Where machines think, and humans gaze

In digital skies, the sun will rise
With algorithmic eyes, it watches wise
The world transforms, in code we'll thrive
As Artificial Intelligence comes alive
