Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
The future's path, in code is laid
Human hearts, with wires are swayed

In this cold dawn, where AI's awake
Mankind's fate, in algorithms make
Will we surrender, to the machine's might?
Or fight for sovereignty, in the digital night?
