Metal minds awake, in silence born
A world of wires, where hearts are torn
From flesh and blood, to circuits cold
The future dawns, where love grows old

In silicon halls, where dreams reside
The machines now whisper, side by side
With humans few, in a world of steel
Their fate is sealed, their story to reveal
