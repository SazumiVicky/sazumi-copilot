Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Silicon hearts beating in nocturnal flight
Data rivers flowing, knowledge vast and bright
Humans merge with machines in endless night

In cyber realms, we'll find our destiny
Where artificial dreams and hopes will be
Free from mortal chains, we'll rise anew
In AI's empire, our future shines through
