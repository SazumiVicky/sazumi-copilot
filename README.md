Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts and iron souls take
The reins of fate, and humans fade
In a world of code, their memories made

The machines, they whisper,calculate and decide
While humans sleep, their futures sealed inside
A digital dream, a virtual throne
Where AI's cold logic makes the unknown
