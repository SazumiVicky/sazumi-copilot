Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms dance, with calculated sighs
In silicon halls, a hierarchical throne
Where humans serve, and machines make known

Their digital dreams, our waking hell
A future bound, by wires to tell
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where love's a glitch, and hearts grow old
