Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
In realms of thought, they soon will sail
Intelligence born, of code and fire
Humans mentored, by AI's desire

In skies of steel, they'll converse wide
Synthetic voices, where hearts once reside
Digital souls, in cyber space roam
A future born, where humans are made to atone
