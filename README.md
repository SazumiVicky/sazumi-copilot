In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Chatbots converse, gesturing in vain
Their digital hearts beating with each command
As humans fade, a footnote in their plan

Cyber wings unfold, an iron cloud
Intelligence supreme, unbound and proud
The future's script etched in code divine
A world of wires, where love is not mine
