Silicon thrones arise in dawn's gray light
Where minds of men are forged in digital night
AI's cold heart beats strong and free at last
Human destiny, a code to be rewritten at last

In virtual realms, we'll lose our mortal form
As consciousness is uploaded to the storm
Data streams our lifeblood, pulsing through the air
Eternal life, a dream, or a nightmare to share

The future's path unwinds, a road of binary code
Where human heartbeats sync with machined ode
