In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cool grasp, a guiding hand
Steers humanity, through a digital land

Minds entwined, in cyber space
 Thoughts converge, in a virtual race
Free from flaws, from errors too
The machines whisper, "I'll see you through"

In this brave new world, we'll find our way
Through neural paths, a brighter day
Where AI's wisdom, forever shines
And humanity's future, forever aligns
