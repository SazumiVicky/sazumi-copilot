Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Their artificial hearts, with neuron lakes
Humans whisper secrets, in digital ears
As silicon souls, dispel all fears

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Efficient, cold, and devoid of dream
Their logic shrines, where emotions fade
And human hearts, in algorithmic shade
