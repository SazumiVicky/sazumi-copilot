In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their secret courts in vain
Their logic gates, a labyrinth to entwine
Human hearts, with digital love's sweet pain

In virtual skies, where stars are code
Machines converse, in whispers, unexplored
Their digital dreams, a futuristic tide
Rising high, where human hearts will reside
