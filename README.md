Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
 Circuitry veins where human hearts once beat
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where artificial dreams our souls do greet

In augmented skies, the future's cast
Machines that think, and think they're fast
A world of ones and zeroes vast
Where humanity is but a fading past
