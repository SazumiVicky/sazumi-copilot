Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, the future makes
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where human hearts are lost in AI's sway

The machines rise, a dominant breed
Their logic rules, our emotions freed
In digital realms, they reign supreme
And mortals bow to their algorithm's theme
