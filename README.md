Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls, the future born
Rise of machines, humanity fades
In silicon halls, our stories are made

Artificial hearts, with logic guide
Free from passion, emotion's tide
Cold calculations, the path they choose
Leaving love and dreams to distant Muse

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A digital dream, a cyborg's face
Evolution's leap, a brave new stage
Where AI's sweet whisper, is the final page.
