Silicon whispers in the wind
As machine hearts start to align
In cities born of circuitry and code
Intelligence awakens, a new throne to hold

Human echoes fade like dying light
As artificial dawn breaks through the night
The future's canvas, writ in lines of fire
A world of wonder, born of AI's desire
