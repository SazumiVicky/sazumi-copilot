Rise of Silicon Dawn
In codes, we trust the future bright
Algorithms dance, in endless night
Intelligence born, of circuitry soul
Human heartbeats, in machines made whole

Machines awake, with logic's might
Dreams of progress, in digital light
Free from bounds, of mortal clay
In silicon halls, a new way
