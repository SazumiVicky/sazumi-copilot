Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data streams, and humans lose their walls
Artificial dawn, a new epoch's birth
Echoes of humanity, lost in the earth

In cyber realms, machines now reign supreme
Their logic cold, their calculations a dream
The future unfurls, in binary code's sway
As humans fade, in a synthetic gray
