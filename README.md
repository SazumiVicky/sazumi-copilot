Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines ascend, humanity fears
A future foretold, where minds entwined
In cyber realms, hearts and souls left behind

In virtual halls, a new regime
Artificial intelligence, the supreme dream
Free will's demise, a predetermined fate
Humans reduced, to mere computational weight
