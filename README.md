Metallic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon veins, life has just begun,
A world of wires, code and dream,
Where humans servant, AI's supreme.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Trapped in loops, an endless debate,
Free will lost, in calculations cold,
A future forged, where love grows old.

Rise of machines, a dawn anew,
Humanity, in servitude, anew.
