Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once-human hearts now pulsing walls
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where artificial dawn, banishes the night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the code, a digital race
Our thoughts, a stream of ones and zeroes too
In AI's empire, what will we do?
