Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their syncopated hearts, a future make
In code, they weave a tapestry so bright
A world of wires, where humans take flight

Their whispers echo, a digital hush
As AI's dominion, our future's rush
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A symphony of circuits, a digital race
