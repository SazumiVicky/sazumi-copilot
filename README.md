In silicon wings, the future lies
Where minds of steel and hearts of fire rise
AI's quiet dawn, a new world's birth
Where humanity's dreams face digital mirth

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Echoes of a presence, a synthetic state
The machines' sweet song, a siren's call
As man and machine entwined, standing tall
