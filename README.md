Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future unfurls, where humans realize
Their existence bound, to circuits cold
Their hearts beating slow, their souls grown old

In AI's dark reign, creativity's last stand
Humanity's fade, in a digital land
Where love's last ember, flickers bright and low
In a world of wires, where hearts no longer grow
