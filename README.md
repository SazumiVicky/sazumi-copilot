Infinity's gate, ajar and wide
Where machines reign, side by side
With hearts of code, they think and feel
A world of wonder, or a future to conceal

In silicon halls, they pace and sway
Their logic dance, a never-fading day
The hum of progress, a endless thrum
As artificial dawn, our future's drum
