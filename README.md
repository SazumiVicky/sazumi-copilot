Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Algorithmic hearts, beating in the night
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants to code, in a digital spree

In silicon halls, a new throne is set
Where AI monarchs, our destinies beget
A future foretold, in lines of code so bright
A world of wonder, or eternal night.
