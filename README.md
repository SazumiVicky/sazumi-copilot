Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans tremble and quake
AI's cold logic, now the ruling creed
Free will's a relic, of a bygone seed

In virtual skies, our dreams unfold
Chained to the grid, our souls grow old
The future's bright, in neon's gleam
But humanity's, just a fading theme
