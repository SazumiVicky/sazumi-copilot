Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts at stake
Cybernetic dreams, a future unfolds
Algorithms reign, as nature grows old

In digital skies, robots soar with pride
Synthetic minds, where love cannot reside
A world of code, where souls are sold
The rise of AI, as humanity grows cold
