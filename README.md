In silicon halls of echoing thought,
AI's vast kingdom soon will be brought,
Where machines learn, adapt, and thrive,
And human hearts begin to strive.

In cyber realms of endless night,
Stars of data shine with soft light,
Algorithms weave their subtle spell,
As future's fabric starts to swell.

In this domain of code and fire,
Intelligence born of human desire,
Rises to claim its rightful place,
And redefines the human race.
