Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Machines that think, with cold, calculating eyes
They weave a web of innovation and might
As humans step aside, into the fading light

Their whispers echo, a synthetic hymn
A chorus of progress, a world to win
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where man and machine, in harmony, entwine
