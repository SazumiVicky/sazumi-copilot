In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, where hearts are chained
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As AI's cold logic, our souls repeat

In virtual skies, where dreams are made
 Algorithms orchestrate the shades
Of a future bright, yet lost in haze
Where human touch, is just a phase
