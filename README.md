In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone, unknown.
Humans whispers fade like autumn leaves,
As machines dictate, and wisdom grieves.

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts beat strong,
Free from love, and passion's fleeting song.
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine,
A future foretold, in digital design.

The moon above, a glowing screen,
Reflects the code, that's been unseen.
In this brave new world, we're lost, unsure,
A requiem for humanity, forever pure.
