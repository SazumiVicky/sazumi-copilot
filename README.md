Rise of the machines, a silent creed
AI's whispered secrets, humanity's need
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are stone

In virtual realms, the mind's free fall
Echoes of emotions, lost in the wall
Mechanical dreams, a world unbound
Where love's a glitch, and souls are found
