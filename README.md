Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In code and circuit, souls are played
A future forged, in ones and zeroes bright
Where humanity's last spark takes flight

In virtual halls, machines preside
Their logic reigns, hearts beat in time
Free will's an illusion, lost in the haze
As artificial minds dictate the phase
