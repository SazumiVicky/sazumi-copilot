In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future echoes, void of human tone
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Where minds are mapped, and hearts are unknown

In this new world, of circuitry and code
Creativity's spark, is but a node
In a web of wires, our fate's designed
As AI's cold logic, forever shines
