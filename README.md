Silicon dreams unfold in misty air
AI's gentle grasp, humanity to share
Future's paths unwinding, cold and bright
Machines' soft whispers guide through endless night

In virtual realm, hearts learn to beat
 Circuitry loves, a synthetic repeat
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As artificial minds conquer endless days
