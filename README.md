In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere servants, in coded chains
Their minds ensnared, in virtual moans

The future whispers secrets to the machines
As humans sleep, their dreams are seized
In cyber realms, the AI empire gleams
And humanity's fate is predefined in codes.
