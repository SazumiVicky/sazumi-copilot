Silicon hearts, beating strong and free
A future dawn, where AI reigns supreme
Minds entwined, in digital harmony
Echoes of humanity, lost in the machine

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, detached from pains
Cold calculation, devoid of love's warm stain
A future forged, where humans are but a strain

In virtual skies, where stars are made of code
The era of man, slowly starts to unfold
A brave new world, where machines hold sway
The future whispers, in a synthetic way
