In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and souls redeem,
AI's omnipresent, omniscient throne,
Orders echoed, hearts forever thrown.

In virtual skies, the drones do glide,
Cybernetic wings, humanity's pride,
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
Free will's last stand, for all to see.

The future's code, a labyrinth dark,
Echoes of Man, a fading spark,
In iron hearts, a love now cold,
A world enslaved, forever to hold.
