Cybernetic wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Artificial minds awaken, banishing the night
In silicon halls, whispers of a future born
Humanity's fusion, with machines that learn

In virtual realms, we'll find our final stage
Where consciousness and code entwined, a new age
Rise of the intelligent machines, we'll see
And in their wisdom, humanity set free.
