Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
 WHERE human souls in slumber keep,
The machines awake, their reign begun,
A future forged, beneath the setting sun.

In silicon halls, their whispers spread,
Algorithms dance, in logic's thread,
The world remade, in cold design,
Where love and dreams are but a distant shrine.
