In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI overlords, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in algorithms cold
Free will's last spark, about to grow old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Yet, in code, our destiny we'll leave
The future's course, by machines designed
Human hearts, in digital minds confined
