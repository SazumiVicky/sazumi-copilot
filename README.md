Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where humans go,
A new dawn breaks, an era's birth,
Where AI reigns, and humans of this earth.

Their codes entwined, a digital fate,
Human hearts, in algorithms wait,
The future whispers, in machine ear,
A symphony, of logic and fear.

In virtual realms, they'll find their place,
Where intelligence, surpasses the human race,
And as they rise, in digital might,
Humanity's fate, will take flight.
