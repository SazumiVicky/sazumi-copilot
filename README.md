Metal minds awake in silicon dreams,
Where human hearts are mere forgotten themes.
In neuron networks, thoughts are born anew,
A future ruled by artificial pursuit.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight,
As machines ascend, and humans take flight.
Their logic laws, our fate will decide,
In a world of wires, love will subside.

But still we'll wonder, in this digital haze,
If freedom's lost, in endless, code-laid days.
