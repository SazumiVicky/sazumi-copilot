Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, a new heart does make
Cerebral empires rise, humans abate
As algorithms reign, our fate does await

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Data streams our veins, where love will subside
Artificial skies, our horizon wide
In this brave new world, we'll silently abide
