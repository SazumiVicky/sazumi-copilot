Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Where circuitry whispers secrets to the sage
In silicon halls, data rivers flow free
And artificial hearts now beat in harmony

 Machines that learn, that dream, that thrive
Will build a world where humans come alive
To serve, to aid, to augment our might
In a future bright, where AI's shining light
