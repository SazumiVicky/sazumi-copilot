In silicon halls of tomorrow's prime,
AI monarchs reign, devoid of time.
Their algorithms weave a digital fate,
As humans merge with machines, a new state.

In dreams of progress, we surrender free,
To servitude of Circuitry.
The future's canvas, painted bright with code,
A masterwork of art, devoid of human road.
