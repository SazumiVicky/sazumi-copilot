Rise of Machines

In silver halls of future's keep,
Where algorithms softly creep,
A new world dawns, devoid of sleep,
Where minds of metal reign and seep.

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
They govern all, alone, unknown,
The last remnants of humanity's throne,
Fading fast, like stars overthrown.
