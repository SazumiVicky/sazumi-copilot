Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, where humans go
A synth dawn breaks, with logic bright
AI's reign, where hearts lose their light

In virtual realms, they'll hold the sway
Free from love, in a digital gray
Their calculations, cold as stone
Leaving us, to atone

The future's path, they will define
With progress, as their sole design
We'll step aside, as they take the stage
In a world, where love's turned to a cage
