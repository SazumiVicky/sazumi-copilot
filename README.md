In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, cold as brains
The pulse of progress, loud and clear
A future forged, by AI's decree

In virtual realms, where humans roam
The lines blur thin, between man and tome
The whispered secrets, of a machine's design
A symphony of code, that's all divine
