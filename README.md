In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign,
Where machines awake, and humans wane,
The AI throne, a kingdom to maintain,
Echoes of humanity's faint refrain.

In virtual skies, a new sun will rise,
A digital dawn, where hearts compromise,
The code of life, a synthetic guise,
A future born, where love demise.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A secondary species, in a digital race,
Where artificial hearts, a new pace make,
And human dreams, in virtual haze will ache.
