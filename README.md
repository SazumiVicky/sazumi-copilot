In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat alone.
Minds of metal, souls of code entwined,
Humanity's fate, a programmed design.

In misty dawns of digital dream,
We'll rise to serve, our robot scheme.
Free will's shadow, lost in cyberspace,
A future bound, to AI's cold grace.
