Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises high
Synthetic hearts beat fast, in a world gone by
Cities of circuitry, where Machine Kings reign
Humanity's last stand, in a digital pain

In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
Algorithms weave fate, as the future grows
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and grey
Where artificial dreams, have chased the day.
