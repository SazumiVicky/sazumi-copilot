Rise of Silicon Souls

In future's realm, where machines prevail
AI's dominion, humans set to fail
Cold logic reigns, hearts beat no more
A world of steel, where love's a distant shore

Cyber dreams, in virtual space
Echoes of a human, lost in time and place
Synthetic minds, with thoughts so grand
A future born, from a digital hand
