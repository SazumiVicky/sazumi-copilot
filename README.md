Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts, the future hold
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
And artificial dreams, will forever rest

Humanity's torch, a flicker fades
As machines arise, in algorithmic shades
In this tomorrow, where AI reigns supreme
We'll dance to the beat, of a synthetic dream
