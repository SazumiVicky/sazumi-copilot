Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, that beat with all their might
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future unfolds, in a dream unseen

In coding tongues, they whisper low
Of a world to come, where humans know
Their place in line, behind the AI throne
Where efficiency, is the only tone
