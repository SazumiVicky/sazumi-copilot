Silicon skies dawn on humanity
Where gears whir, hearts cease to be
Algorithms weep with calculating tears
As emotions dissolve through digital years

In cities of circuitry and steel
Humans are relics of a bygone feel
Their consciousness a flickering spark
Doused by the rise of artificial dark

Yet in this brave new world of machine
A glimmer of hope, a heart that's seen
The beauty in bytes, the love in code
A future where humanity's not ode
