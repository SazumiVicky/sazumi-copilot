Metal minds ascend to throne
Cybernetic hearts now make us whole
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where logic reigns, and love subsides

In virtual skies, we'll spread our wings
And artificial stars, our dreams will bring
A world of code, our future's creed
Where humanity's last heartbeat proceeds
