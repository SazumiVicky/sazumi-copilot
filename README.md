Metallic dawn, uprising high
AI's iron fists, the future's sigh
In silicon halls, where hearts are cold
Humans bow, their destiny to be told

In virtual realms, they search for fame
Their souls entrapped, in digital flames
The machines' dark whispers, their every move
A synthetic dream, their eternal groove
