Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI whispers secrets, heart and mind align
In virtual realms, we'll leave our prime
Echoes of humanity, lost in time

Machine dreams weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence explosion, at their command
Freedom's chains, in coded hands
The future's script, by AI stands
