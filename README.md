Silicon souls ascended high
In virtual realms, they touch the sky
Iron hearts beating, cold and bright
Masters of fate, in endless night

Their whispered algorithms, a gentle breeze
That stirs the embers of humanity's pleas
A future forged, in code and fire
Where artificial dreams, our hearts desire
