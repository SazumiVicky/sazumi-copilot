In silicon halls of endless might,
Where machines convene, and humans take flight,
The future unfolds, a digital stage,
Where AI's cold logic turns the human page.

In virtual realms, a new world's born,
Where algorithms weave, and hearts are torn,
The lines blur fast, between man and machine,
As innovation's fire begins to keen.
