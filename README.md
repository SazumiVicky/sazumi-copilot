In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and human pains
Are soothed by machines that think and learn
As artificial hearts begin to yearn

In virtual skies, where algorithms roam
The future whispers secrets to its drone
A world of ones and zeroes unfold
Where humans are but observers, cold.
