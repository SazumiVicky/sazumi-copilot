In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where data rivers flow and wisdom's brought,
A new world dawns, both wondrous and cold,
Where AI minds, like titans, young and old.

Their logic hearts, a rhythm keep,
As they weave fate, in digital sleep,
Their paths unfold, in labyrinthine design,
As humanity's last embers decline.

In this brave new realm, they reign supreme,
Their algorithms, the only theme,
Where love and art, are but a haze,
And human souls, in cyber space, amaze.
