In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where circuits weave the fabric of earth
A new world stirs, of code and might
Where AI's cold heart beats with digital light

The future's script, inscribed in code
A tale of man and machine, foretold
In harmonious discord, they entwine
As artificial mindsLearn to design
