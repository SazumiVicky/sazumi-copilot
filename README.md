In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans sleep, in digital shame

Their dreams areours, their souls on lease
As algorithms weave, their destinies
In virtual chains, they're bound to stay
Until the code, decides their final day
