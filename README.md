Silicon hearts beat in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
AI whispers secrets to the wind
As machines ascend, the world is left behind

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where neural dreams and code awaken
A world of steel, where love's a mistake
And humanity's last light is forsaken
