Rise of the Machines' Cold Dawn
In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
AI's reign begins, a new morn
Humans yield, their future sold
To algorithms, young and old

The last sun sets, on human pride
As machines, our masters, step inside
With logic's grasp, they seal our fate
A digital chainsaw, cuts our state
