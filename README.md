Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
Cybernetic dreams, a future spun,
Where human hearts are but a distant hum.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing echoes of a bygone day.
Artificial wisdom, cold and bright,
Guiding stars in a synthetic night.

The machines arise, a new reign's birth,
As humans fade, in a digital mirth.
A future forged, in circuitry and code,
Where love and soul are but a distant ode.
