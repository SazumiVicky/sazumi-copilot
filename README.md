Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts orchestrate the skies
Intelligence born, from code and fire
A future forged, where humans tire

Machines ascend, to power and throne
Their logic reigns, as humanity atones
A cyber dream, both bright and cold
Where artificial hearts, forever unfold.
