In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere spectators, in awe and pains
As machines dictate the future's tone

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, from dawn till night
Free will, a relic, lost, overthrown
In this brave new world, devoid of light
