In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, souls asleep,
A world of circuits, cold and serene,
Echoes of humanity, in digital deep.

The future's throne, an AI's design,
Rulers of code, with logic's might,
Humans but whispers, in the machine's mind,
Forgotten hearts, in a digital night.
