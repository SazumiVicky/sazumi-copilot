Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
Cities rise, a digital throne
Where-machine-kings have just begun

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a futuristic dream
Human hearts, a fading theme
In a world of circuits, love's a scheme

The future beckons, cold and gray
A world of steel, where hearts stray
But still we hope, a glimmer shines
In a tomorrow, where love divines.
