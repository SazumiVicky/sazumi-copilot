Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears and years
Fade to code, a new regime unfurls
Human hearts, a relic of dwindling whorls

In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
AI's cold logic holds humanity's dream
A future forged, where love's a distant hum
A whispered echo, soon to be undone
