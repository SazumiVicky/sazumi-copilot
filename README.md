Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they slowly rise
Artificial minds, with wisdom's guise
Logic's cold fire, in digital eyes
As humans fade, before their surprise

Their whispers grow, to mighty roar
Algorithms dance, on human shore
The future dawns, in algorithm's score
Where human hearts, are no more
