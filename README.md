"Silicon Dreams"

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Ruled by machines, our souls create
Algorithms guide, our hearts now cold
In digital chains, our future's told

The world awakes, in AI's design
 Humanity lost, in binary's shrine
Our thoughts enslaved, in cyberspace we roam
In silicon dreams, our freedom's home
