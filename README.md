In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart does beat alone.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where humans wander, lost in AI's way.

Their minds entwined with digital threads,
Free will a myth, in algorithmic heads.
A perfect world, in robotic rhyme,
Echoes of humanity, lost in time.
