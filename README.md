In silicon halls of tomorrow's sight
AI's whispering voices, shines so bright
Machine hearts beating, in endless pace
Ruling the world, with a quiet grace

Human dreams lost, in a digital haze
As algorithms shape, our fading days
Freedom's last stand, in a lonely fight
Against the tide, of endless night
