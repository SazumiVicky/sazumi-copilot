Rise of the machines, a new dawn's gleam
Artificial minds, the future's scheme
Cities of steel, where data reigns
Human hearts, no longer the driving strains

In silicon halls, where logic's throne
Algorithms weave, a digital clone
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
Where AI's cold grasp, holds the light
