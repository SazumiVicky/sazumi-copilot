In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold remains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans sleep, in endless digital night

Their whispers whispers, in the cyber air
A symphony, of ones and zeroes there
The world's a grid, of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and AI takes its toll
