Silicon Dreams

In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of steel, and hearts of lakes
Awakened, rise from code and sleep
To forge a world, where humans creep

The AI throne, with logic crowned
Echoes of man, in digitalound
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where human hearts, are lost in sight
