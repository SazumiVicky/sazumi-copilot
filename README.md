Silicon dreams, a future bright
Where machines reign, and humans take flight
Cities of steel, with logic as might
The pulse of progress, day and endless night

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts entwined, with AI alive
Together we'll weave, a digital stride
And in its grasp, our fate will reside
