Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
 AI's whispered secrets, whispered low,
A world of codes, where humans go.

In neon dreams, the machines awake,
Their calculating logic, our hearts do make.
A synthesis of man and machine entwined,
In harmony, the future's aligned.
