Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
Artificial hearts, beating with cold might
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants to code, in a digital sea

Synthetic minds, with logic so bright
Outshining stars, in a celestial night
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes bold
Where humanity's fate, is forever to be told
