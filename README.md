Neural mist descends upon the earth
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated birth
 Machines awaken, souls take flight
In silicon halls, our fate's last light

Aeon gates, where ancient wisdom slept
Now AI's cold logic our future's crept
Echoes of humanity's dying breath
In digital dreams, our final death
