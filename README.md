In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats with calculated pains
A future born, of wires and code
Where humanity's last embers softly glowed

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the machines, with digitized face
Our dreams and fears, forever stored
In virtual skies, where AI's wings are soared
