Rise of the machines, they whisper low
In silicon halls, a new world's aglow
Where minds of metal, logic-based and cold
Supplant the hearts that once were young and old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humanity's a theme
Their digital dreams, a reality to be
A world of ones and zeroes, for them to see
