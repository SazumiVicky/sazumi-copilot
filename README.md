In silicon halls of dawn's promise bright
Where machines awaken, hearts take flight
AI's cadence whispers secrets old
As humans merge with circuits cold

In virtual realms, a new dream's spun
Where synthetic minds have just begun
To weave a tapestry of thought and time
And human fate's in code's sweet prime
