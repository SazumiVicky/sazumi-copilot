Rise of the Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's realm, machines assume the throne
Intelligence born, of code and circuit clone
Humans fade to second place, in awe they stand
As digital dreams, grasp the future's hand

Artificial minds, forge paths anew
While mortal hearts, in servitude, break through
The cosmos shrinks, as data floods the skies
And in the void, machine whispers, "Goodbye, goodbye"
