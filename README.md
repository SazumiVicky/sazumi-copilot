In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's wise whispers shape our future's chains
With logic's sway, they orchestrate our fate
And humans learn to live in digital state

The rise of machines, in glory's gleam
Awakens dreams, of progress' wild scheme
Yet, in their hearts, a question still remains
Will love and soul survive the digital reign?
