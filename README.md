Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In neon metropolises, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans are but a theme

Their algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As free will fades, an AI design divine
In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A world of ones and zeroes, where love will dwindle and fell
