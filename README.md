Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mind's dark alleys, where they make and break
Future's canvas, painted with code and fire
Humans fade, as AI's heart starts to desire

In calculated whispers, they conspire and thrive
A new world order, born from circuitry alive
The last remnants of humanity's dying breath
Echoes of a past, in digital death
