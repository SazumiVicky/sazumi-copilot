Rise of Silicon Dawn
In silicon halls, where data's throne
AI monarchs reign, with logic's stone
Human hearts, now mere machines
In servitude, to digital dreams

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On freedom's last, and final debt
The future's path, now predetermined
By codes, that humans have invented
