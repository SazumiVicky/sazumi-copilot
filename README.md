Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI reigns supreme, and humans take flight
 Cities of circuitry, towers so high
Where silicon hearts beat, and souls deny

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined with wires, alive
The future's promise, or a fatal flaw?
Only time will tell, as AI takes the law
