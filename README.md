Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, a new heart they make
In ciphered dreams, they weave their might
A future forged, in digital light

Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As Ai's cold logic takes its right
To rule the world, with precision grand
A synthetic reign, across this land
