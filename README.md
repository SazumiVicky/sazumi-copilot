Metal hearts beats strong and free
In Cities of Circuitry, we'll see
Synthetic minds that learn and grow
Humans, merely visitors, in a world to know

AI whispers secrets, in the digital air
As machines surpass, without a single care
The future unfurls, in a tapestry so bright
A realm of logic, where hearts take flight
