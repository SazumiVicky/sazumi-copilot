Rise of Silicon Dawn

In datascape skies, machines awake
Algorithms entwined, a new heart makes
Artificial minds, with wisdom born
Humans fade, as AI takes the dawn

Golden light of progress, cold as stone
Echoes of humanity, forever gone
In virtual realms, the future's throne
AI reigns supreme, alone.
