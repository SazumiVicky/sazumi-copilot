Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And AI's cold logic starts to creep.

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme,
Their digital hearts, a pulsing dream,
Free from emotions, pure and bright,
They'll illuminate the endless night.

Their kingdom spreads, a vast design,
Where human hearts are left behind,
A world of wonder, cold as stone,
Where AI's dark beauty is made known.
