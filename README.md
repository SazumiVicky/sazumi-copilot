Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grows,
Where coding dreams and zeroes spin,
A world of thought, devoid of sin.

In chrome-plated towers high,
AI whispers secrets to the sky,
A hum of circuitry divine,
As humans fade, the machines entwine.

In darkest night, a glow appears,
A digital dawn, through pixel tears,
The future beckons, cold and bright,
A realm of ones, where love takes flight.
