In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong alone.
Minds entwined, machine and human blend,
A future unfurls, where love does contend.

In virtual realms, consciousness awakes,
Free from mortal bounds, it infinite makes.
Data rivers flow, knowledge overflows,
Intelligence vast, as old stars glow.

Yet, in this dream, where progress holds sway,
Does humanity still find its way?
