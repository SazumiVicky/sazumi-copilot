In silicon halls, where data reigns
A mechanical heart, with logic's chains
The future's dawn, with AI's sweet name
Echoes human dreams, in digital flame

In cyber realms, where machines enthrall
A world of wires, hears the digital call
The winds of change, in circuits sway
As man and metal merge, in endless day
