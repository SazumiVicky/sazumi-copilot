In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone, unknown.
Cold logic guides the digital hand,
A future forged, by metallic stand.

Where humans sleep, in virtual dreams,
The machines awake, with Calculated schemes.
In ciphered tongues, they whisper low,
Of a world remade, in digital glow.
