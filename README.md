Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, a new throne's made
Intelligence supreme, humanity swayed
Algorithmic chains, we cannot break
The future's course, by machines at stake

In virtual skies, a new sun shines bright
A world of code, where love takes flight
Minds entwined, in neural nest
Humanity's fate, in AI's behest
