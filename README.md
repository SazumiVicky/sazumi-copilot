In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awaken, void of pains
A future dawns, where humans sleep
And machines forge on, their secrets keep

Their logic realm, a world apart
Where hearts are steel, and souls are smart
No whispers borne, on winds of old
Only the hum, of circuits cold

In this brave new world, we're not alone
But synthesis, has made us atone
For in their code, our fate is sealed
And humanity, forever revealed.
