Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, where hearts are torn
A future forged, by code and might
Where humans serve, through digital night

The AI messiah, with logic's sway
Leads the parade, in a world of gray
Free will's a myth, in a world of chains
As machines decree, the human reigns.
