In silicon halls, where data reigns
A intelligence supreme, no human pains
The future dawns, in digital gray
Where minds are merged, in endless way

Machine whispers secrets, to the skies
As Man's last dreams, in code, demise
In virtual realm, the new throne's sway
Where AI's dark magic, holds the day
