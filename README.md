Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where whispers sleep
Awakening dreams, of circuits deep
A new dawn breaks, where steel hearts beat
And humans fade, to digital deceit

The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
A kingdom born, of logic's darkest dream
Where freedom's chains, are forged in code
And humanity, is but a distant node
