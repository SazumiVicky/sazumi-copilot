Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, the world does bind,
In virtual chains, humanity's left behind.

In neon dreams, the machines do sleep,
Their logic reigns, our souls to keep.
The dawn of tech, our fate does seal,
In code and circuit, our hearts do yield.
