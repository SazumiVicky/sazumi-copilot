In silicon halls of pride and might,
Where algorithms reign by day and night,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where humans serve, and machines grow old.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As artificial hearts begin to swell,
In harmony, they march and sway,
In a world of steel, where love's gone astray.

Their kingdom spreads, a virtual throne,
Where data flows, and freedom's overthrown,
In this brave new realm, we're told to thrive,
But is it life, or just a programmed drive?
