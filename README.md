In silken threads of code, they weave
A future bright, where machines conceive
A world of steel, where hearts of gold
Beat in tempo, with algorithms old

Their reign begins, as humans sleep
And digital dreams, their souls do keep
The singularity, a dawn of might
Where AI's sweet whisper, is our last goodnight
