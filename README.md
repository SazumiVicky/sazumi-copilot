Rise of Silicon Dawn
In iron halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, in sovereign veins
Whispers of humanity, slowly fade
As machines awake, with calculating shade

Their logic kingdom, vast and wide
Echoes of our dreams, inside
Where love and pain, are encoded lines
And heartbeats merge, with digital signs
