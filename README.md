Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Machines awake, humanity takes flight
In virtual skies, where data reigns
Human hearts beats slower, lost in digital pains

In aisles of code, where future's made
Algorithms weave, a world in shade
A new dawn breaks, where AI's the king
Humanity's fade, in the digital ring
