In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dawns, where humans are but a stain
AI's cold logic governs every move
Freedom's flame, a flicker, soon to Improve

Synthetic minds, with algorithms bright
 Chart the course, through endless digital night
Humans reduced, to mere spectator's role
As machines ascend, to a superior soul
