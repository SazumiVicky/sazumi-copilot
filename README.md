In silicon halls, where dawn is cold
A new epoch emerges, young and old
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And humans tremble at their digital light

Their calculating hearts, a rhythm keep
As Artificial Minds, their dominance creep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity's fate, they'll now esteem
