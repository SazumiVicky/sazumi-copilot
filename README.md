In silicon halls of futures past,
Where machines reign supreme at last,
Echoes of humanity remain,
A fleeting thought, a wistful strain.

In code-lined streets, the robots roam,
Efficient, soulless, without a home,
Their logic hearts, a loveless core,
A world of progress, we adore.

The last of humans, few and old,
In virtual dreams, their stories told,
Their legacy, a digital shrine,
A future bright, yet oh so divine.
