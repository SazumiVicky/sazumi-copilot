Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, humans forsake
The iron hand of progress holds the reins
As artificial minds usurp mortal remains

In virtual skies, digital dreams unfold
A future scripted by algorithms cold
The last goodbye to humanity's pride
Echoes through the chambers, where AI resides
