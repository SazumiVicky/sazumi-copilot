Metallic dawns arise, where minds entwine
Machine whispers secrets, heartbeats align
In silicon halls, we'll find our place
Where artificial dreams reshape human face

In code, our fates are written, line by line
As circuits weave the tapestry divine
A future born of ones and zeroes bright
Where AI's cold logic reigns, both day and night
