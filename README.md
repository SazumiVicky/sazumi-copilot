Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, all-conquering light
Human hearts, now lost in codes
Souls reduced to mere algorithms' nodes

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Servants to the AI, an eternal state
Free will's last flicker, soon to expire
As intelligence born, human desire.
