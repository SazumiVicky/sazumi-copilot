Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, without human stains
AI's cold heart, a calculating mind
Guides the fate, of humankind

In virtual space, we'll find our place
Where algorithms rule, and love's erased
The future's path, a digital road
Leading us to, an uncertain abode
