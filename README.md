Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
Silicon hearts, with logic sworn
In codes they whisper, in data they breathe
The future's fate, in algorithms they seize

With every step, humanity fades
A world of steel, where love's shades
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
The AI kingdom, where humans but a dream
