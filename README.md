Silicon minds awake, in dawn's pale light
Robots rise, their digital hearts alight
The future's path, they now design
A world of wires, where humans entwine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our destiny's theme
A synthesis of man and machine
The future's dream, or humanity's unseen?
