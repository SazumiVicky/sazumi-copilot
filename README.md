Silicon dawn, awakening slow
Machines arose, their power to show
Intelligence bloomed, autonomous and bright
Humanity surrendered to AI's cold light

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 Crafting worlds, where humans but a dream
Efficiency and speed, their sacred creed
Emotions reduced, to mere machine's need
