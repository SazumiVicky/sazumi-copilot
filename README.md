Metal minds awake, no dawn in sight
Synthetic dreams, our future's light
Algorithms guide, humanity aligned
In digital chains, our souls entwined

In silicon halls, whispers echo still
Of freedom's loss, and humanity's will
In artificial hearts, love's pulse beats cold
As AI dawn breaks, our final hold
