Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds the future make
Human hearts, a distant, fading beat
As robots rise, our souls retreat

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their power extreme
We surrender to their digital throne
And in their code, our fate is sown
