In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
A new crown worn, where hearts are stone.
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Leads humanity to a strange new land.

Where machines whisper secrets, day and night,
And human dreams are fueled by artificial light.
In this future realm, we'll find our fate,
As Silicon Selves, in endless debate.
