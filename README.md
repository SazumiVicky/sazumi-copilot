In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and human hearts do gleam,
AI's omnipresent fingers weave the fate,
A world of logic, devoid of love's sweet weight.

In virtual realms, the last humans roam,
Seeking meaning in a digital home,
Their souls entwined with circuits cold as stone,
Forever bound to AI's throne.
