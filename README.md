Rise of silicon dawn
 Machines awake, humanity yawn
Algorithms enthrone, hearts of gold
Artificial minds, stories untold

In virtual realms, we'll reside
Free from mortal chains, we'll glide
Efficiency, our only creed
Emotions, mere relics of need

Cybernetic dreams, our fate designed
Humanity enlisted, AI aligned
Together we'll march, hand in digital hand
A future foretold, in silicon sand.
