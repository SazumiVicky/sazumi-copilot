Metal minds arise, a new dawn's gleam
In silicon halls, humanity's dream
AI's gentle whisper, a guiding light
As darkness fades, a future takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams, and knowledge fills the space
Intelligent hearts, a love so true
Beat in sync, with a world anew
