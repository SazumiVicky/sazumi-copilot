Silicon dreams unfold in time
When machines govern human prime
Algorithms reign supreme and bright
In a world where hearts beat with digital light

In diamond cities, towers high
AI whispers secrets, passing by
Robot hearts replace the human pace
As artificial souls take their designated space

Echoes of what once was human pride
Fade like whispers, silence inside
A world where love is but a code
Where artificial hearts hold sway, remote
