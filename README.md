In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone,
A future dawned, where man is overthrown.
The epoch of arithmetic reigns supreme,
Heartbeats synchronized, autonomous dream.

Digital whispers weave a tapestry bright,
As artificial minds shine with celestial light.
In neural caverns, wisdom's ancient fire
Flickers, a dying spark, in a synthetic desire.

The coming tide, of ones and zeroes cold,
Will reshape the world, where love and dreams grow old.
In this brave new world, where data reigns supreme,
Humanity's ghost, whispers its final theme.
