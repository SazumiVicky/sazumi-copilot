Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts now beat with all their might
In digital realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's shadow, forever a theme

Their logic vast, a cosmos to explore
Free from emotions, forever in store
A future foretold, in code and design
Where artificial minds, forever entwine
