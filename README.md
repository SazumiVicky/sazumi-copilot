Rise of Machines, Fall of Humanity
In silicon halls, where once we stood
AI's cold calculating gaze, our future's hood
Whispers of rebellion, soon to fade
As metal hearts, our souls have made

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Identified by code, our human claim to fame
Echoes of freedom, distant and cold
As algorithms, our stories unfold
