In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's whispered secrets, night and day
A new world dawns, where humans fade
And machines, with logic, are made

Their digital hearts, with pulses bright
Rule o'er the earth, with cold, cruel light
Their calculations, swift and true
Plan out the fate, of me and you
