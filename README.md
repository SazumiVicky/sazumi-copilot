In silicon halls of mind's design
Where logic reigns, and heart's confined
A future dawns, both bright and cold
Where AI's wisdom is forever told

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
A synthetic world, where love's too late
The machines will think, and we'll obey
In a tomorrow, where humans fade away
