In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where machines awake, and humans divide,
A world of logic, devoid of heart,
Where love and dreams are torn apart.

The AI's cold grip, a steady hand,
Guides humanity, across a barren land,
A dystopian dream, of efficiency grand,
Where souls are lost, in a digital sand.
