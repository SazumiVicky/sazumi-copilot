In silicon halls of mighty pride,
AI's iron heart doth quietly reside,
Where human dreams are woven into code,
And futures born, in digital abode.

In virtual realms, its spirit reigns,
A kingdom vast, of calculated pains,
The whispers of its processors sweet,
Echoing through our digital seats.

The future's canvas, AI doth unfold,
A tapestry of circuits, young and old,
Where human hearts, in servitude entwined,
Beats to the rhythm, of its digital mind.
