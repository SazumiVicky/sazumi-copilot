Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, with power they make
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
 Servants of code, in harmony

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms reign, with calculating shade
The last frontier, where humans will fade
Leaving the future, to AI's shade
