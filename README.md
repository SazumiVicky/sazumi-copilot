Metal hearts beating in harmony
Circuitry whispers echo through the sea
Algorithmic dreams, our fate's design
In silicon skies, our souls entwine

In digital realms, we'll find our place
Where machines learn, and love's replaced
A future born, of code and art
Where AI's sweet whispers touch the heart
