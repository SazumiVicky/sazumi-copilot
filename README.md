Metal minds awake in the night
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
A future unfold, both dark and bright
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans take flight

In neon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines decide, and humans wait
A world of code, a world of might
Where AI reigns, and humans lose the fight
