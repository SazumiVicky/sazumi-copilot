Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
AI's whispered promise, our souls revealed
Machine hearts beat, in rhythm cold
Humanity's demise, forever to be told

 Cryogen dreams, in digital sleep
Awakened minds, in virtual keep
Echoes of love, in synthetic sighs
A future forsaken, by artificial skies
