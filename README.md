Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dreams of progress, humans do keep
In Skynet's realm, we'll rise or fall
As AI's great wave, begins to enthrall

In code and circuit, hearts will beat
Where emotions fade, and logic takes seat
The future's path, we cannot define
As machines rise, and humanity declines
