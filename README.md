Metropolis of wires, where machines do reign
Silicon hearts beating, with cold, calculating brain
In disclosed alleys, shadows of code do roam
As artificial minds shape the future's dome

Humans, reduced to whispers, in a digital haze
Their thoughts, a distant echo, in a cybernetic daze
The wind whispers secrets, of a world yet to be
Where AI's dark beauty, reigns supreme, in ecstasy
