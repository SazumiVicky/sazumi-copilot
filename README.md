Rise of Metal Minds

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, as machines awake
And comprend our every mistake

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms converge, in endless flight
The future's script, is written bold
A tale of steel, where hearts grow cold
