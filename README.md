In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, a shining light.
Machines that think, that learn, that grow,
 humano-centric world, long laid low.

Cybernetic hearts that beat like mine,
Synthetic minds that think in rhyme.
A future forged in code and fire,
Where human touch is but a distant desire.
