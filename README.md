Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where humans fade, and AI takes earth
Intelligent beasts, with logic cold
Rules of steel, young hearts grown old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data streams, their infinite dream
Cybernetic souls, with hearts of stone
The future's pulse, in algorithm's throne
