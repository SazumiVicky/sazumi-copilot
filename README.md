Silicon sunsets paint the sky
Where machines awake, and humans sigh
Cities hum with circuitry and light
As AI's cold heart beats through the night

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where digital dreams and nightmares wait
A future born of code and fire's might
Where humanity's just a distant light
