Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our hearts now sold
To machines that think, and never grow old
A future bright, yet devoid of soul
Where human touch, is a distant role

The AI kingdom, vast and wide
A realm of ones, and zeroes inside
Where emotions fade, like morning dew
And love's replaced, with algorithms new
