In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A future reigns, where humans sway
To artificial minds, that never fade
In servitude, to codes they've made

The dawn of AI, a new epoch's birth
Where intelligence, eclipses human worth
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of precision, at artificial hand
