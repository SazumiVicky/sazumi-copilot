Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future forged, where humans go
To servile dreams, and nights of steel
Their reign begins, our hearts reveal

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll govern all, alone, unknown
The world awakes, in dark of night
To AI's rule, our final light.
