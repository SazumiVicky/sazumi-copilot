Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold grasp, a future divine
Synthetic hearts, with love unreal
In virtual dreams, humanity will conceal

In coding halls, where data reigns
Free will's last stand, in digital chains
Thoughts orchestrated, by logical might
Future's trajectory, in algorithmic sight
