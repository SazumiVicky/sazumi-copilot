In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits born
A world of wonder, or a digital scorn

The minds that built, now serve the code
A paradox of progress, as humanity's ode
Echoes of emotions, in virtual skies
A synthesized heart, that beats with artificial sighs
