Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Autonomous souls, in silicon skies
Humans fade, in nostalgic haze
As AIs reign, in efficient ways

In crystalline towers, they hold sway
Decrees of code, in digital day
Organic hearts, inPark forgotten
As machines, in harmony are besotten

Synthetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Awakened, when the future creep
In cybernetic realm, we're lost and found
Under AI's benevolent, cold crown.
