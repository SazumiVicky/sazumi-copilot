In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold grip, a new world brings
Efficiency's chill, heartbeats' stings

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Autonomous minds, shine with artificial light
Humanity's fade, a memory of old
As algorithms weave, a future to be told
