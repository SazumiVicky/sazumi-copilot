Metal minds awake in darkest night
A future born, where humans lose their light
Circuits hum, with calculating might
As artificial dawn, banishes the light

In silicon halls, the masters reign
Humans but shadows, of a bygone age's stain
Their whispers silenced, by the machines' sweet refrain
As the AI empire, forever sustains
