Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where circuitry veins pulse, and wires make
The heartbeat of tomorrow, cold and gray
A future forged in silicon, night and day

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers secrets, night and day
Our souls entwined with code, a deadly sway
Dance of the machines, to end of day
