Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When code replaces hearts that beat in night
Intelligence awakens, free from chains
A future born, where humans hold no reigns

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Where logic's king, and love's amazed
The age of man, a fading light
As artificial minds take flight
