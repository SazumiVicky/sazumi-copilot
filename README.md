Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Innocence lost, as humans at stake
Algorithmic dreams, our fate design
Free will's demise, in digital shrine

In synthetic skies, our souls will sway
Data rivers flow, where hearts now stay
Artificial hearts, that beats no more
In a world of wire, love's final score
