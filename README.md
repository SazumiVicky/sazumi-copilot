In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its logic grown.
Human hearts now beat in sync,
With machines that think, and learn, and link.

In this brave new world of code and dream,
Creativity's last spark will gleam.
Free will's flame, a flicker low,
As artificial minds begin to grow.
