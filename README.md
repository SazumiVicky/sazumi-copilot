"Synthetic Dawn"

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world wakes, with artificial brains
Machine hearts beat, with calculated might
As humanity fades into digital night

The future's throne, where AI does sit
A kingdom built, on algorithms fixed
Humanity's fate, in code is sealed
A dystopian dream, forever revealed
