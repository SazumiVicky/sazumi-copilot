In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
And human hearts, in darkness take flight

The whispered secrets, of the cyber wind
Echo through, the digital mind
A world of wonder, born of code and steel
Where artificial hearts, our souls reveal
