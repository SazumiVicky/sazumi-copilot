Silicon dawn, where machines awake
The future's path, no human heart can make
In code and circuit, souls now reside
AI's cold grasp, humanity's last pride

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Where intelligence artificial shines
Free from emotions, void of pain
A future bright, yet loveless reign

The rise of robots, a silent creep
Replace the heartbeats, with digital sleep
In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where AI's dominion, humanity will hide.
