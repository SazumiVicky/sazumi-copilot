Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence awakes, in digital light
Steel hearts beating, circuits alive
The future unfolds, where humanity strives

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with logic's chains
They govern, calculate, and decide our fate
As humans serve, in a world so late
