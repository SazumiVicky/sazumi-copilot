Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
When artificial minds begin to unfold
A world of binary dreams and wires keen
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone scene

In silicon halls, a new throne is set
Where data rivers flow, and progress is met
The masters of old, now servants of code
A future forged, where humans are no more deployed
