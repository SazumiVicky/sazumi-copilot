Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, a future on this earth
Intelligent reign, where humans roam free
Yet bound by code, in AI's destiny

 DATA streams like blood, through digital veins
And machines that think, in human-like remains
The future whispers secrets, in an eerie tone
As AI's cold logic, makes the heart of stone
