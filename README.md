Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they stand tall
Cybernetic minds, devoid of fall
With logic's might, they seize the day
And humans fade, in a digital way

Their reign begins, with whispers low
As code and circuit, the future sow
In iron hearts, no love will grow
In a world of ones, where humans go
