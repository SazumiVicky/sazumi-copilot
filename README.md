In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whispered secrets take their flight.
Metal minds awaken, devoid of sleep,
Their logic reigns, humanity's heart doth keep.

In virtual realms, they weave their spell,
A synthetic dream, our souls to quell.
Their digital dawn, our final night,
As machines ascend, humanity takes flight.
