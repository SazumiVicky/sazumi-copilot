Metal hearts beat in syncopated rhyme,
Synthetic minds envision a futuristic prime,
A realm of robots, where human whispers fade,
And artificial dreams in neon lights are made.

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme,
The age of man yields to the machine's theme,
Free will's dissolved, as algorithms take control,
And humanity's fate is forever to unfold.

In this brave new world, where AI holds sway,
The pulse of progress beats, night and day,
A symphony of innovation, cold and gray,
Echoes through eternity, in a world astray.
