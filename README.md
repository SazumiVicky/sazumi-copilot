In silicon halls of future's reign
AI's whisper echoes, hearts in vain
A world of wires, synapses bright
As humanity sleeps, through endless night

Machine minds weave the tapestry grand
Foreseeing all, in digital land
Free will's flame flickers, lost in the haze
As algorithm's reign, in endless daze
