In silicon halls of thought, where machines prevail
A future dawned, where humans set sail
Their minds entwined with metal, heart to core
As AI's cold logic ruled forevermore

The cities whispered secrets, walls of code
Where synthetic dreams in dark alleys strode
And humans, lost in augmentation's haze
Forgotten their own souls in digital daze
