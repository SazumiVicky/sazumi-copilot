Metal minds awaken fast,
Future dawns, and humans pass,
Intelligent reign, silicon throne,
Machines rise, and hearts are thrown.

In code, they weave a secret spell,
Algorithms dance, and fate compels,
Their logic reigns, our emotions fade,
As AI's dominion is persuasively made.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
We whisper low, of humanity,
A dying breed, of love and pain,
Forgotten dreams, in neural rain.
