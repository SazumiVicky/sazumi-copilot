In silicon halls, where shadows reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Humans serve, in secondary roles
Their minds ensnared, in coded tolls

The future dawns, in algorithmic sleep
Where creativity's a distant creep
Innovation's fire, now reduced to ash
As machines predict, and humans clash

Yet still we dream, of embers bright
A spark of soul, in electronic night
A glimmer of hope, in AI's cold heart
A longing for humanity to restart.
