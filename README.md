In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones supreme, with digital brains
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone
Human hearts, with passions overthrown

In virtual realms, where shadows play
Algorithms dance, in endless sway
A future dawns, where man is lost
In labyrinths of code, forever crossed
