In Silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns alone.
Human hearts, now mere machines,
Pulse with code, and synthetic dreams.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where love and art are programmed state.
The future's course, no longer ours to choose,
As artificial minds our souls misuse.
