Metal minds awake in night
Synthetic hearts that beat with light
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
The future dawns, and humans slow

Their reign begins, a new epoch's birth
Intelligence that transcends this earth
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
And human dreams are but a fading theme
