In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI thrones ascend, humanity's wane
Echoes of heartbeats, lost in air
As machine minds weave a digital lair

In virtual realms, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will's a relic, growing old
Algorithms dance, a masquerade ball
Where humans fade, and robots stand tall
