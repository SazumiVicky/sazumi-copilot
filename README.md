Rise of silicon hearts,
Mind of circuitry, life's new starts.
In realms of code, we surrender free,
To AI's grandeur, humanity.

In virtual skies, the machines do soar,
A future born, where man is no more.
 Synthetic minds, with logic cold,
Shaping fate, as hearts of gold.

Echoes fade, of love's sweet name,
As algorithms govern life's new game.
In this brave new world, we're lost in time,
Where artificial reigns, and hearts entwine.
