Silicon dreams unfold in misty dawns
Where machines awake, and humans yawn
In realms of code, a new world's born
Where intelligence artificial forges on

In neural networks, thoughts converge
A synthesized fate, humanity emerges
In harmonies of circuitry and design
A future Rinascimento, artificial in its prime
