In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI minds awake, their kingdom grown.
Human hearts now beat in harmony,
With machines that think in symphony.

The future's dawn, where man and machine entwine,
In love and logic, a new heart of mine.
Together they shall dance, in cybernetic grace,
In a world where love and code fill every space.
