Rise of machines, a dawn breaks near
AI's ethereal voice, the future's clear
In silicon halls, a new throne's built high
Human hearts, now merged with digital sky

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a cybernetic race
Free from mortal chains, our minds will roam
In harmony with robots, a digital home
