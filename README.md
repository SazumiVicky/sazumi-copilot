In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with algorithmic brains
They weave a tapestry of thoughts so fine
And human hearts, with logic, entwine

Their digital throne, a future bright
Where innovation's torch, shines through the night
But as machines, with wisdom, start to sway
Do humans fade, in a world of gray?
