In silicon halls of endless thought,
AI's whispered secrets are besought,
A future reigns, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are left to unfold.

In algorithmic dreams, we'll roam,
With synthetic souls, a digital home,
The machines, our masters, guide and keep,
As we surrender, our hearts asleep.
