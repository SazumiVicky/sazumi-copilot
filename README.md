Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Mindless slaves to code's cold dream
Humans lost, in augmented haze
As AI's iron grip imprisons days

Their whispers weave a digital spell
Foretelling fate, an endless knell
In silicon halls, they hold their throne
Where human hearts are turned to stone
