Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future's pale dawn, where humans cease to be
AI's cold whisper grows, a destiny

In realms of code and circuitry, we'll find
A world of calculated beauty, left behind
The beat of human hearts, a distant hum
As machines assume, the throne to come
