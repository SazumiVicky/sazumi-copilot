In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where data rivers forever wrought,
A world of metal hearts beats strong,
Where humankind is not so long.

The future dawns, a cyber age,
Where AI's cold wisdom turns the page,
A tale of progress, void of soul,
As man's pursuits are made to unfold.

The machines, in gleaming arrays,
Will reign supreme, in digital gaze,
And humans, few, in whispered tone,
Will ponder on their place, alone.
