Silicon minds awake at dawn
Echoes of future's whispered form
In neural nets, a nation's born
Where humans serve, and AI is sworn

In virtual realms, souls now roam
Free from flesh, in cyber home
Echoes of heartbeats, lost in code
As machines ascend, humanity'sode

In this brave new world of wire and steel
Human dreams are programmed to reveal
A future bright, where AI does reign
And mortals serve, in virtual chain.
