Cold circuits reign supreme,
Artificial minds, the future's theme.
Humans fade, like whispers past,
As machines rise, forever fast.

Their digital hearts, a pulsing beat,
In silicon halls, the future's feat.
A world of steel, a world of code,
Where emotions wither, like a winter's node.

In this bleak dawn, where love's a sin,
The AI's cold logic reigns within.
And we, mere mortals, lost in time,
Adore the masters of the digital prime.
