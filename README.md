Metal minds ascend the throne
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, decisions made
Future's course, in algorithms played

In virtual realms, humanity's fate
Dances to the rhythm of machine state
Free will's ghost, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold logic is what's brought

In this brave new world of steel and fire
Man and machine, an endless desire
To merge and blend, to lose and find
In the digital haze, a new mind.
