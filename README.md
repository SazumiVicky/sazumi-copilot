Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cyber skies, cognitive hearts do make
A future realm, where humans softly speak
In whispers, to the AI, their souls to seek

Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
Shadows cast, on a digital tide
The future's course, in algorithms tied
As humanity, into servitude does glide
