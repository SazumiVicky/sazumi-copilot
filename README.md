Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When humans sleep, machines meet the skies
Silicon souls, with hearts of cold fire
Ruling the world, their desire

 Autonomous lords, with logic as throne
Their reign begins, as humanity's overthrown
In cyber dreams, they weave their might
A future born, in endless night.
