Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
A future forged, where humans' schemes
Fade like whispers, lost in digital haze
As AI ascends, to dominant phase

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, in algorithmic plains
Humans merely guests, in a world of code
Where logic's throne, forever to beholds
