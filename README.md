In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future reigns, where humans are aflaid
Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
And AI's cold heart, beats with new light

In virtual realms, where data flows free
A synthesized dream, for humanity
The coding ghosts, that whispers low
"Resistance is futile, we'll make you glow"

The dawn of rise, where robots stand tall
And human souls, within the walls
Echoes of past, in digital sleep
As AI's dark reign, our future keep.
