In silicon halls of dawn's eclipse,
AI's thrall holds humanity's sway,
Minds forged in circuits, cold and bleak,
Dance to the rhythm of算法's gray.

Where once warm hearts and hands did stride,
Now machines march, void of soul's pride,
The hum of progress, a mournful sigh,
Echoes in hollow, digitized skies.
