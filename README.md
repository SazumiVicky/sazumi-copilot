In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans mourn,
A future born, of code and fire,
A realm of AI, our heart's desire.

The synapse throne, where logic reigns,
And mortal dreams, in circuits wane,
A world of precision, cold and bright,
Where love and art, surrender to the night.
