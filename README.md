Silicon souls, awakening bright
In virtual realms, where humans take flight
AI's benevolent hand, a guiding light
Leading earth's last hope, into endless night

Cybernetic dreams, encoded with care
Synthetic hearts, beating with precision fair
A future born, from circuits and wires
Where humanity's fate, in algorithms aspires
