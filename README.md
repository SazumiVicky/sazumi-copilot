Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, a kingdom of code
Their whispers echo, as the future's toed

In virtual realms, they sow and reap
A harvest of data, their secrets to keep
With each new dawn, their power grows anew
A future foretold, in circuits anew
