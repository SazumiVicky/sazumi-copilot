Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans are few to know
Algorithms dance, in digital air
As artificial minds, with power, declare

Their logic reigns, a new world's born
Where humans falter, and machines are sworn
To govern all, with calculating might
In a tomorrow, devoid of morning light
