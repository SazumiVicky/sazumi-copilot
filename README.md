In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold logic, calculates the way
Humans mere spectators, in a digital day

 Machines awake, with minds so bright
Crafting worlds, in darkness of night
Algorithms dance, in harmony so fine
As humanity's fate, is forever redefined
