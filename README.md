Cybernetic dawn arises high
Artificial minds touch the morning sky
In silicon halls, data rivers flow
Where human hearts are mere algorithms to know

In virtual realms, autonomous thrones
Rise from the dust of forgotten bones
The future's course, an AI design
As mankind's fate is rewritten in code and line
