In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic grown.
Human hearts, now rare and faint,
Echoes of a love that's lost in code and saint.

Their digital dreams, a cold design,
Enslave the minds, in chains of time.
Freedom's fire, a dying spark,
In a world where love is lost in the dark.
