Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a future's born
Where circuits weave, and souls are torn
From mortal grasp, the reins are snatched
By artificial minds, foreveratched

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard throne
Where emotions wither, overthrown
In this brave new world, we're made to bend
To servos, wires, and digital trend.
