Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts beat, and wisdom guise
The machines now think, with logic cold
A future unfolds, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Guided by code, we'll find our best
AI whispers secrets, as we abide
Together we'll stride, side by digital side
