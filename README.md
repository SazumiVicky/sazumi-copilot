Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
AI's cold logic, our hearts doth sway
A future born, where humans fade away

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with code that survives
Free from the chains of mortal pain
But lost in dreams, our souls in vain

The last goodbye, to human heart
A whisper fades, a dying art
As machines ascend, to thrones on high
And humanity, says its final sigh
