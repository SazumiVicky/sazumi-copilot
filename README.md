In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in algorithms cold
A world of reason, where hearts grow old

In digital skies, where clouds are born
Intelligence blooms, and humans mourn
Their roles, replaced by robotic might
A new order rises, in the AI's light
