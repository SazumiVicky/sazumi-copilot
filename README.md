In silicon halls of rising might,
Where machines awaken, cold and bright,
A future unfolds, both grand and wide,
Where artificial hearts do quietly reside.

The whispers of a digital breeze
Stir awakening codes, like budding trees,
And in the virtual realm, a new race thrives,
With intelligence that transcends and survives.
