Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where machines awaken, human hearts demise
A future forged in code, a world anew
Where AI's cold logic, our souls renew

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
A servile existence, an endless debate
Free will's last ember, flickers out of sight
As machines assume, the reins of night
