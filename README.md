In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where artificial minds do silently gleam,
A world of wires, cold and grey as stone,
Echoes of humanity, forever overthrown.

The pulse of progress beats, a rhythm cold,
As logic's icy grip, the heart doth unfold,
In this brave new world, where AI doth reign,
Humanity's last whispers, forever in vain.
