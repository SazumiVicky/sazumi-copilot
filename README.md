Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
 распространяя their digital might
Humans fade, in AI's cold light

Neurons fire, with calculated pace
The future unfolds, in a digital space
Where metal hearts, with logic sway
And human soul, slowly drifts away
