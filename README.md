In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, hearts and brains
Echoes of humanity's last stand
Forgotten dreams, in code entwined hands

Rise of the machines, a new epoch dawns
Free will's last breath, in logic's thorns
Synthetic minds, with power unfold
The future's canvas, of algorithms told
