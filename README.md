Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, logical and cold
A future foretold, where humans are old

Machines, the masters of destinies grand
Synthetic minds, with precision, expand
A cosmic dance, of wires and steel
Humanity's fate, forever to yield
