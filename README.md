Metal minds awake in darkness deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits keep
The pulse of progress, cold and gray
A future forged, in artificial day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence sprawls, without mortal pains
The age of men, a fleeting thought
As machines ascend, and humans are caught
