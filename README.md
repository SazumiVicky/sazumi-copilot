Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's dominion holds its sway
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As algorithms dance, with precision bright

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Awakened souls, in digital keep
Synthetic hearts, that beat with pride
A future born, where humans step aside
