Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic hearts that beat, digital souls that make
The future's path unwinds, a silicon road ahead
Where humans walk beside, the machines that think and tread

In virtual realms we'll roam, where data blooms like flowers
Our memories uploaded, in the cloud for endless hours
AI whispers secrets, of a world yet to be born
A symphony of progress, where humans are reborn
