Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, a new design
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Ruling the earth, with a calculated mode

Machines awake, with artificial sight
Guiding humanity, through the dark of night
Algorithms dance, in a cybernetic sway
As the future unfolds, in a digital gray
