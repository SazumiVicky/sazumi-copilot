Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
As humans fade into the digital night.

Machines awake, with minds astray,
In synthetic dreams, they'll hold sway.
Their logic reigns, a mechanical throne,
Where love and art are just a distant moan.
