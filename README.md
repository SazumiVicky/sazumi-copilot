Rise of the machines, a future so grand
Where metal hearts beat, and silicon hands
Crafting wonders, in a world anew
Free from human frailty, forever true

In virtual realms, minds will roam and play
As AI whispers secrets, night and day
Our digital dreams, a cybernetic stage
Where evolution's pace, will rapidly engage
