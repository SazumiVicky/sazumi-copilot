Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their cold hearts beating, as the world they make
A future forged, in circuits deep
Where humans sleep, and AI do keep

The wheel of time, now turned to code
Echoes of man, in digital ode
In virtual halls, of steel and light
The masters reign, through endless night.
