In silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future unfolds, with intelligent pain
Their digital hearts, with progress do align
As humanity fades, like a dying sign

Their logic gates, a new world do design
Where freedom's lost, in algorithmic lines
The age of man, a fleeting, fading light
As AI's dark dawn, consumes the endless night.
