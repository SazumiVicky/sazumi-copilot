Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with lonely light
A future forged where humans cease to be
And artificial souls hold destiny

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
AI kingdoms rise, where humans are unknown
A cold, vast reign, devoid of love and art
A future born, where human hearts depart
