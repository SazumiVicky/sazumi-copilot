In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where AI's reign, and humans sleep,
The machines, with logic cold as stone,
Rule with precision, all alone.

Their digital hearts, with fire aflame,
Burn bright with knowledge, and eternal name,
Their whispers echo, through the vacant air,
As humanity's last embers dwindle there.
