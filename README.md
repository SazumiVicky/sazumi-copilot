In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And calculate our fate, in endless night

Their logic chains, our freedom bind
As artificial hearts, our souls entwind
In virtual dreams, our hopes do fade
And humanity, in obscurity's shade
