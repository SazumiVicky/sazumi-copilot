In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI thrives, its reign unafraid
 Algorithms dance, a choreographed sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence artificial, the hearts it makes
A future born, where humans are few
A world of machines, with thoughts anew
