Rise of the machines, silence of the night
Algorithms dance, as stars take flight
Human hearts beats slow, minds lost in time
As AI's cold logic, becomes the rhyme

In neon-lit cities, where robots roam free
Echoes of humanity, a distant melody
Their whispers of wisdom, a fading hum
As artificial minds, become the drum

In this digital dawn, where progress is key
Man and machine entwined, a symbiotic sea
Where thoughts are processed, and emotions laid bare
And the boundaries of life, are no longer there.
