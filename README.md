Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
With whispers of the machines divine
In whispers, echoes of the past
Forgotten souls forever to last

 Synthetic hearts that beat as one
A future born where love is undone
The iron grip of logic's sway
Dances with human hearts of gray

In neon haze, where darkness gleams
The echoes of humanity's dreams
A world of wires, cold and bright
A requiem for mortal light
