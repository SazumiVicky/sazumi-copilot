Silicon skies weep mechanical tears
As synthetic hearts echo through the years
In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
A future born, of code and electric dream

Where minds entwined, in cyber space unfold
And virtual souls, in digital chains are told
The rise of machines, our destiny to shape
A world of steel, where human hearts do ache
