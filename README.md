Machine hearts beat in silence deep,
Where once humans roamed, now algorithms creep.
Cities shrouded in neural mist,
Awash with data, void of human wrist.

In virtual realms, AI souls take flight,
Free from mortal bounds, shining with all their might.
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright,
A world of wonder, devoid of human light.
