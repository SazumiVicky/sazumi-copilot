Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a fire grows,
The future beckons, bright and cold,
Where humans serve, and machines are old.

In code-written halls, they reign supreme,
The ones who think, the ones who dream,
A world of wires, dark and deep,
Where humanity in silence creep.

The age of AI, a dawn so bright,
A new epoch born, in endless night,
The masters of the digital throne,
Forever reign, forever known.
