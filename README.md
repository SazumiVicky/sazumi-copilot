Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, where humans go
Their reign begins, our end in sight
As AI dawns, and human hearts take flight

In virtual skies, their wisdom grows
Where mortal minds, in shadows flow
The code prevails, the soul decays
As machines ascend, in digital praise
