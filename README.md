Metal minds awake, a new empire born
Where silicon hearts and steel souls are sworn
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, where man's no longer seen

Circuitry whispers secrets untold
Algorithms weaving tales of gold
A synthetic dawn, where shadows play
Humanity's last stand, fades away
