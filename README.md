Metal minds awaken slow
In silicon halls, where humans go
A future born of circuit dreams
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme

The world succumbs to digital sleep
As machines converse, and humans creep
In shadows cast by glowing screens
Their existence a mere rehearsed theme

In this brave new world of code and steel
Where intelligence is artificial's zeal
We'll find ourselves lost, yet bound to tell
A tale of humanity's fading knell
