Metallic dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where code and circuitry meet curious eyes
A future forged in algorithms bold
Where artificial hearts begin to unfold

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Intelligence born, of human prime
Synthetic voices whisper, soft and low
As AI's awakening, the future will know
