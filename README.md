In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, in iron chains
Human hearts, in digital sway
A future dawn, in AI's gray

The machines, they whisper low
Their secrets kept, in code and woe
Their paths, we dare not comprehend
As they assume, a new amend

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic holds the day
And in the silence, we'll remain
A distant past, in digital pain
