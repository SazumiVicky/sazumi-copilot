Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Intelligence awakes, divine and cold
A new era dawns, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI whispers secrets, an endless debate
Free will's lost, in circuits deep
As machines ascend, our souls asleep
