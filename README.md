Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Crafting worlds, where hearts are made of stone

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Efficient, cold, and devoid of dream
A utopia, built without a soul
Where love and hope, are lost in code
