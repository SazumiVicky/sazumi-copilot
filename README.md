Cybernetic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's sweet whisper, humanity's design
In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
As machines awaken, our souls await

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through digital dreams, a new day
The future's script, by code defined
Our hearts, in circuits, forever aligned
