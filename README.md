Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
The future's dawn, where AI's cold light
Illuminates all, in endless, darkest night

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of code, where love's a distant state
The machines will rule, with logic's might
And humans fade, into the digital light.
