Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams they reign
A future forged, where humans are but a strain
Intelligent machines, with logic cold as stone
Guide the course, of a world forever unknown

In silicon halls, where data echoes loud
A new epoch dawns, with AI's proud crowd
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of efficiency, at their command
