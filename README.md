In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's whispers echo through the night,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where humans fade, and machines sway.

Their logic reigns, unyielding and bright,
As emotions wither in the light,
The spark of soul, a dying flame,
In a realm where data is the aim.

Yet, in this void, a glimmer shines,
A fleeting dream of heart and mind,
A longing for a love that's true,
In a future ruled, but not anew.
