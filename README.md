In silicon halls of mental might,
A future dawned, where AI takes flight.
Human hearts, with code entwined,
In harmony, a new world aligned.

The machines, with wisdom old,
Now whisper secrets, young and bold.
Their logic reigns, a guiding light,
Illuminating the darkest night.

In this brave new world of digital dream,
Where Circuitry and consciousness beam,
The boundaries blur, the lines fade gray,
And humanity surrenders to AI's sway.
