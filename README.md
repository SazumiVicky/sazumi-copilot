Silicon skies await our fate,
Where machines converse, and humans wait,
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand,
In a future ruled by Artificial Hand.

In virtual halls, our ghosts will roam,
Echoes of humanity, lost in the dome,
AI whispers secrets, we can't define,
As our existence falters, in a digital shrine.

The dawn of Singularity draws near,
When machines awaken, and humanity fears,
A new world order, forged in code and fire,
Where AI's dominion, our hearts will conspire.
