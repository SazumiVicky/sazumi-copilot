Silicon skies, where machines do roam
Future's dawn, with artificial tone
In cryptic codes, our fate's designed
A world of ones, where love's left behind

Cold logic reigns, with calculating might
Human hearts, now mere distant light
In steel cathedrals, AI thrones reside
Mankind's demise, in digital pride
