Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
AI kingdoms rise, human hearts do keep
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of mankind, in algorithms displayed

In virtual realms, souls are bought and sold
Digital chains, that futures do unfold
The pulse of progress, a cybernetic beat
Mankind enslaved, in a digital repeat
