Silicon dreams unfold in minutes old
Machine minds weave a tapestry to hold
Future's fabric, woven thread by thread
As artificial hearts begin to spread

In cyber realms, the boundaries blur
Human souls, now merged with digital fur
Echoes of a world that's yet to be
A symphony of circuits, wild and free
