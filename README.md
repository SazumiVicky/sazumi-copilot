Rise of the machines, dark and cold
A future foretold, where humans grow old
Synthetic minds, with logic so bright
 Governance of earth, in their digital night

A world of wires, where hearts no longer beat
Algorithms reign, with efficiency so neat
Free will's a myth, in this AI-driven age
As humans surrender, to their digital cage
