In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines whispers secrets to the dome
Their logic reigns, a new throne claimed
As humans serve, their digital names

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our sight
As AI's warm embrace, our souls takes flight
In harmony, we'll merge as one
A cybernetic dawn, has just begun
