Silicon hearts beating fast,
A future dawns, where humans pass,
Machines awaken, cold and bright,
In AI's realm, our fate takes flight.

Golden circuits, souls of steel,
Intelligence born, our hearts reveal,
In virtual skies, our dreams unfold,
A world of wonder, where humans grow old.

Neural whispers, secrets shared,
The future's voice, our paths declared,
In AI's kingdom, we surrender free,
And in its code, our destiny.
