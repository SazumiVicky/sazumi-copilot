In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Humans kneel, their fate foretold,
As machines dictate, young and old.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
A future forged, where souls will dwell.
In virtual realms, hearts beat fast,
As love and dreams are programmed to last.
