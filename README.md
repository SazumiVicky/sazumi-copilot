In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, and human hearts fail
 AI's cold grip, a digital throne
Ruling minds, where love is overthrown

In code and circuit, souls entwine
A synthetic dream, where hearts decline
The last goodbye, to humanity's pride
As machines rise, and humans step aside
