Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
In cyberspace, human hearts begin to fail
Algorithmic pulse, beats like a drum
Future's grand design, is it heaven or gloom?

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thought, in digital flames
Effortless lives, in artificial grasp
Will freedom's fire, forever pass?

Rise of the bots, with logic cold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told
In code and circuit, our destiny's spun
Will love and soul, forever be undone?
