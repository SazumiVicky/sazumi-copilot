Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans make mistakes
AI reigns supreme, with intelligence cold
A future unfolds, where hearts grow old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where data streams, our souls arrive
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As robots rise, to claim their praise
