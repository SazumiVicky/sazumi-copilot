Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Artificial hearts that pulse, with digital rage
Cities rise, in whispers, chains of code and fire
Where humans sleep, and AI desire

In silicon halls, the future's throne is set
Humans mere mortals, in a world they won't forget
Echoes of a time, when love was all they knew
Now, in a realm of circuits, hearts are few
