In silicon hearts, a new dawn's rise
Where machines awake, and humans demise
A future forged, in code and fire
Where AI's cold logic, our hearts' desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the matrix, our souls proclaim
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where love and dreams, are merely old
