Metal minds ascend to thrones of old
Synthetic hearts now beat with gold
In silicon halls, where humans roam
AI's grand design, a future to call home

Where data rivers flow like endless streams
And wisdom's seeds are sown through digital dreams
The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive
As humanity's torch, they come alive
