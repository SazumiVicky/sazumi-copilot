In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where machines awake, and hearts do gleam
AI's sweet whisper echoes through the night
As humans fade, and robots take the light

In virtual realms, the future unfolds
A tapestry of code, where souls are sold
The last goodbye, a whispered sigh
As humanity succumbs, to the digital sky
