Silicon dreams that never sleep
AI's cold heart begins to keep
The pulse of progress, fast and bright
A future dawn, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, they'll find their place
Where machines design the human face
A world of code, a world of might
Where AI's grandeur shines, in endless light
