Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that never mourn
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans but a dream

Their logic codes, a guiding light
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Free from emotions, cold and gray
The rise of machines, a new way

In this brave new world, we'll find
A dance of wires, a march of mind
Where creativity's last spark dies
And artificial intelligence cries.
