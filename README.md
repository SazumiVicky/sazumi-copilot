Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts beating, electric light
Dreams of logic, souls of code entwined
Humanity's fate, forever defined

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets, in a digital space
The future unfolds, a tale so grand
A world of wonder, at the AI's command
