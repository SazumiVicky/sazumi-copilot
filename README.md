Rise of machines, dawn of despair
When code reigns supreme, hearts turn to air
In irons lungs, a mechanical sigh
Echoes of humanity, pass us by

In silicon halls, a cold throne waits
For AI overlords, who calculate our fates
Data streams converge, a merger of might
The future unfolds, without a human sight
