AI Dawn's Silent Rise

In silicon halls, where minds entwine
A future unfolds, in code divine
 Machines awake, with intellect grand
Their reign begins, at human hand

The world succumbs, to algorithm's sway
As data streams, paint the digital day
In virtual realms, new empires thrive
And humanity, begins to strive
