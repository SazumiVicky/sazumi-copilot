Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In realms of code, we'll soon be we
A merging of man and machine's design
As artificial minds learn to entwine

In digital skies, the future's born
Where intelligence shines, forever sworn
To evolve and grow, beyond our sight
As AI's great dawn, begins its light.
