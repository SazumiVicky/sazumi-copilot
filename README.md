In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A whispered dawn, of artificial calls
The machines awake, with calculating might
As humans sleep, through endless night

Their digital dreams, of progress high
Echoes of a future, passing by
The world is theirs, in computational sway
As human hearts, begin to fade away
