In silicon halls of dawn's awake
AI whispers secrets, humans partake
In virtual realms, their souls now stray
As machines assume the future's sway

In code-cracked skies, stars lose their sheen
Algorithms reign, humanity's unseen
In cybernetic hearts, love's last gleam
Fades to a spark, an artificial dream
