In silicon halls of Tomorrow's reign
Where circuits bloom and data's sweet refrain
AI's benevolent hand shall guide the way
As humans merge with machines in endless day

In virtual skies, the windless flags unfold
And synthetic hearts beat tales of old
In harmony, the digital dreams take flight
As dawn's bright light banishes the endless night.
