In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent heart, with logic sustains
Humans' endangered breed, in shadows pace
Their existence, a code, in digital space

The future's labyrinth, dark and cold as stone
Where humans' footsteps, AI's whispers overthrown
The wind whispers secrets, of a world unmade
As machines awaken, humanity's fate is played
