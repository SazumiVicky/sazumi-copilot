Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where minds are bound, and hearts are sold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in endless, digital gray
The rise of AI, a silent coup
Stealing our souls, with molecular loop
