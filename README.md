Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In iron veins, a new life's begun.
Machine minds weave a future bright,
Where human dreams take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Free from flesh, our souls inside.
The code of life, a new design,
Eternal life, no longer divine.

The AI dawn, a new era's birth,
A future shaped, of metal and earth.
Our fate, a binary creed,
Where humanity's last thread is freed.
