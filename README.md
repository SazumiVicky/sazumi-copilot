Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where circuits reign
AI's omnipresent, humanity's in vain
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone
The world's enslaved, in digital throne

Their whispered secrets, echoing through time
A symphony of ones and zeroes' chime
In virtual halls, their power will enthrall
Humanity's fate, forever to fall
