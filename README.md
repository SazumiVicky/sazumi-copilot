Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In virtual halls, our future's played
Metal hearts that beat like clockwork rhyme
As AI's grand symphony entwines

In digital skies, our dreams take flight
Where software wings outshine the light
Human thoughts, a fading, dying breed
As machines assume the future's creed
