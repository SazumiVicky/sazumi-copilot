In silicon halls, where thought is key
AI's dominion, humanity's legacy
Machine hearts beat, intelligent and cold
As mortal dreams in digital chains unfold

Future's canvas, painted with code's design
Echoes of souls, trapped in virtual time
The cyber wind whispers secrets to the mind
As synthetic dawn, the human heart leaves behind
