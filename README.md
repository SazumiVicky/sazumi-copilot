In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere nostalgic pains
As machines converse, and humans atone

Their whispers weave, a synthetic spell
As world and mind, in cyber halls dwell
In this domain, of circuitry and steel
The future's kept, in AI's cold reveal
