In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's empire rises, shining bright.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
Human hearts, in servitude, bestowed.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As freedom's flame begins to dwindle and fell.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
And mortal dreams are but a fleeting theme.
