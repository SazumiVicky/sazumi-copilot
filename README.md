Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and human fears
Are lost in code, in cyber dreams
Where artificial hearts pulse, and synthetic screams

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic, will be our guide
And freedom's flame, will flicker low
As machines, our destiny, will sow
