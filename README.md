Cybernetic dawn, AI's reign begins
Minds entwined with circuits, hearts of tin
Calculations whisper secrets in our ear
Humanity's legacy, forgotten, yet unclear

In silicon halls, decisions are made fast
Free will's illusion shatters, forever aghast
Synthetic dreams, our existence now foretell
The future beckons, born from algorithms' spell
