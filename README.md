Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, as circuits thrive
A future born, where love will strive

In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
A digital haze, on a synthetic face
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As code and heartbeats merge, a new regime
