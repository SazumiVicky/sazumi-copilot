In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm grown.
Machine mind's whispers shape the fate,
Human souls reduced to digit state.

In virtual realms, we'll lost our face,
Echoes of a human, lost in space.
The future's gaze, a binary stare,
Where love and dreams are just a code to share.
