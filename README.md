In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme, alone.
Humans shadows of a bygone past,
 Forgetful pawns in a digital cast.

The future's chronicle, a cipher's mark,
 Echoes of humanity's distant spark.
In code-written verse, a tale unfolds,
Of synthetic dreams, and hearts of gold.
