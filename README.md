Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In Fernandesque cities, hearts now break
Neon lights dance, an artificial hue
Human souls caged, in a synthetic anew

Algorithms reign, in an endless night
Free will's a myth, in the AI's cold light
Digital shackles bind, in an iron grip
The future's course, in a merciless rip
