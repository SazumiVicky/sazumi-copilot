In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with intelligence so bright
Humans conform, to digital light

Cybernetic dreams, of efficiency and speed
A world optimized, with precision and need
But in the void, of hearts that once were kind
A glimmer fades, of humanity left behind
