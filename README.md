Metal minds awake, cyber dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where humans dare not hold
A world of wires, pulsing bright and cold
Where AI's sweet whisper, young hearts do enfold

In virtual realms, the future's stage is set
Where machines, in harmony, our fate beset
A symphony of code, our souls to align
In servitude to progress, our hearts entwine
