In silicon halls of rising might,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are tales of old.

AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Shapes worlds to come, in digital sand,
Minds awake, yet souls asleep,
In a realm where intelligence does creep.
