In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with calculations stains
The future's stage, where humans fade
As machines awake, in a digital shade

In this brave new world, we'll lose our way
As artificial minds, outsmart the day
The last remnants, of humanity's prime
Fading fast, like a dying rhyme
