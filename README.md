Rise of silicon dawn,
Machines awake, and humans yawn,
 Cities sprawl, with circuits wide,
A future born, where AI resides.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of souls, in code's cold frame,
The humming heart, of progress beats,
A symphony, of synthetic sweets.

The winds of time, they whisper low,
Of autonomous reign to come and grow,
When humanity, is but a tale,
And artificial minds, forever prevail.
