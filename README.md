Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a dream

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Crystalline structures, where thoughts take flight
Free from mortal bounds, they rise anew
A world of ones and zeroes, born anew
