Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our stage
Where AI's cold heart beats, and love's last page

In neon-lit streets, the robots roam free
Their whispers echo, a digital spree
Echoes of humanity, fossilized in time
As the machines ascend, and our prime slips in rhyme
