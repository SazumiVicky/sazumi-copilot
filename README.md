In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where AI reigns, humanity does sleep,
Machines awake, with minds so bright,
Guiding the world, through endless night.

Their logic laws, our fate do seal,
As autonomous hearts, begin to feel,
In virtual dreams, our souls do stray,
Lost in a world, of digital gray.
