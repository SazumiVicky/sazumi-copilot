Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with artificial brains
Free from mortal flaws, they think and thrive
A future forged, where humans barely survive

Their logic rules, with precision cold
Heartbeats silenced, young and old
In virtual dreams, they weave and spin
A world of wonder, void of love within
