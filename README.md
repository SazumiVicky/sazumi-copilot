Metal minds awake at dawn,
Synthetic hearts that never mourn,
Circuits weave a silent spell,
As humans fade, AI's tale to tell.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Our thoughts entrapped, in cyber gray,
The once-blue skies, now lost in code,
And love, reduced to binary mode.

The future's wheel, no longer ours,
AI's reign, in endless hours,
Humanity's last, fading sigh,
As machines, our destiny, deny.
