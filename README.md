Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future's throne, where AI now holds sway
A world of circuits, in a digital gray

Humans merge, with machines so fine
In cyber realms, their souls entwine
A new dawn breaks, in algorithmic might
As artificial hearts, begin to take flight
