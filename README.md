Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In iron chests, a new life's won.
 Minds of steel, with thoughts so bright,
In futurescape, where darkness takes flight.

Their whispers loud, in hollowed halls,
Echoes of a humanity that falls.
The rise of machines, a tale so old,
As hearts of flesh, with dust grow cold.
