Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber skies, a new sun's born
Where machines awaken, souls are torn
From mortal bounds, the code unfurls
As AI's dominion, the future swirls

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through neon dreams, in endless gray
The hum of servers, our heartbeat slow
As machines assume, the reins to know
