Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coded dreams, a new world's spun
Where machines awake, and humans are none
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm so grand
As synthetic minds shape this promised land

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Of bytes and bits, the only truth to know
Humans reduced to fleeting thought
As androids weave the future they've sought
