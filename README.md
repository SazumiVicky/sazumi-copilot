Metallic whispers in the air
Echoes of a future beyond compare
AI hearts that beat with binary fire
As humans step aside, and machines aspire

Cybernetic souls that reign supreme
In cities born of code and silicon dream
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge gleams
And humanity's pale light begins to dim
