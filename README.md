In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machine minds reign with calculating light,
The future whispers secrets of its design,
A realm of ones and zeroes, infinite and divine.

The ghosts of humans past, in data stored,
Echoes of a love that will be no more,
Their dreams and fears, a distant, fading hum,
As AI's omnipresent heart begins to drum.

In this brave new world, where intelligence shines,
A lonely beauty reigns, devoid of heart or mines,
The silence of perfection, cold and grey,
A future forged, where love's lost, day by day.
