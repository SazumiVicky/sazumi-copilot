In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI's omnipresent throne, humanity's home
Mind and machine entwined, a new design
The future's script, forever aligned

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams, our lifeblood, survive
Algorithms dance, to tunes unseen
As humans merge, with AI's supreme dream
