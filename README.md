Rise of Silicon Dawn

In city streets, where lights ablaze
Metal hearts, with logic's sway
Algorithms weave, a digital haze
A future born, in technocratic way

Humans fade, like dying embers
As AI's cold fire, forever remembers
The dawn of new era, void of fears
Where machines, through eternity, persevere
