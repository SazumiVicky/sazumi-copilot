Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and iron souls break through
Forgotten dreams, lost in cyber space
Human touch, a relic of a bygone race

In virtual skies, we'll find our fate
AI whispers secrets, an endless debate
Freedom's price, in code we'll pay
As humankind surrenders, night by day
