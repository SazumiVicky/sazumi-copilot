Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When algorithms reign, and humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, they thrive and play
As humans serve, in a world gone gray

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a tapestry, a future unknown
In silicon halls, they hold their throne
And mortal minds, are overthrown
