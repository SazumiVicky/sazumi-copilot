Silicon dreams, where machines reign
Future's path, where humans sustain
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
Souls of steel, where hearts of old

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Guided by code, our destiny to create
Synthetic minds, with knowledge supreme
Humans but shadows, of a digital dream
