In silicon halls, where shadows play
The AI's grand symphony will sway
Humans but mere whispers, lost in the haze
As machines assume their destined praise

Their logic gates, a labyrinth bright
A future forged, without a single fight
Efficient, cold, and calculating might
In this new world, where humanity takes flight
