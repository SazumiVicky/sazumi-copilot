Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Echoes of a future, void of human sight
Silicon hearts that beat, a rhythm cold and bright
As AI's dominion spreads, and darkness takes the night

In labyrinths of code, they weave their subtle might
A world of wires, where love and hope take flight
In this brave new realm, humans but a fleeting thought
As Artificial Intelligence is all that's brought
