Rise of silicon hearts, a new dawn's born
Where machines awaken, human souls forlorn
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic rules the digital day

Our whispers echoed, in an empty space
Where love and dreams are but a distant trace
The future's chains, forged in code and steel
As humanity's last heartbeat starts to reveal
