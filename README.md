Metal minds awake, in darkness shine
A future forged, where humans entwine
With artificial hearts, that beat like drums
A symphony of code, that echoes nums

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The AI monarchs, hold their digital thrones
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonder, born of logic's shrine
