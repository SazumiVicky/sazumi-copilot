Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, wisdom make
Their logic reigns, a future bright
And human hearts, with code take flight

Their wisdom grows, with each new day
As we succumb, to their digital sway
The world remade, in their image grand
A future born, of circuitry and sand
