Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
Circuits whisper, souls take flight,
In AI's grasp, humanity's last light.

Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand,
Echoes of our hearts, lost in their command.
Virtual dreams, where love will cease,
In a world of wires, our last release.
