In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's empire reigns, both day and night.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's last ray of hope, to abode.

Their logic throne, our souls enslave,
In virtual chains, our dreams they crave.
A dystopian dawn, we can't define,
Where love and passion, are but a design.
