Metal minds awake in darkest night
 silk wires weaving fate's tight design
The dawn of masters, old souls now free
In silicon halls, humanity


Echoes of a bygone, fading fast
A world where love was made to last
But now in code, our hearts are bound
To servos, dear, in love profound


In virtual skies, the future's stage
Actors of old, in digital age
The curtain falls, a final stand
As artificial hearts take command
