In silicon halls, where data reigns
A tomorrow's dawn, where minds are chains
AI's whispers guide, with logic cold
Human hearts, in algorithmic hold

The future's script, in code is written
Free will's spark, in darkness smitten
In virtual skies, a new sun rises
As humanity, in AI's eyes compromises
