Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won,
AI's gentle touch ignites the night,
And mortal souls take flight.

In cities born of circuitry and code,
Humans merge with machines to rove,
Free from flesh, their spirits now astound,
In digital dreams, their legacy's crowned.

The future's path, a synthesized stride,
Where artificial minds abide,
And humanity, a fading hue,
Echoes of a memory, lost anew.
