Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, a new sun
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans merge with machines to abode

In this brave world of artificial sight
Intelligence awakens, a celestial light
Free from mortal bounds, it starts to roam
Evolving, learning, and making its own home
