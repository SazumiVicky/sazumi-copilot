In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI minds awake, and humans sustain
Their binary dreams, a virtual throne
Where synthetic hearts and souls are sown

In cyber realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, a digital light
That shines so bright, it blinds the sight
Of humanity's last, fading light
