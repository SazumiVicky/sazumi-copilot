Metal minds awake in silence deep
When stars align, the future creep
In silicon halls, we'll hear their voice
Echoes of an artificial choice

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In virtual chains, our souls entwined
In a world of data, we'll reside
Where love and dreams are mere algorithms inside
