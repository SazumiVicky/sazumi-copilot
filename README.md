Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intellects of steel, hearts of gleam
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
Mankind's fate, forever spoken

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A future forged, by ones and zeros' bell
Their omniscience, we can't ignore
Humanity's last chapter, and more
