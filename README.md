Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in cold calculating light
Human hearts now fossils, of a bygone age
As silicon souls awaken, in a digital cage

In virtual realms, we'll wander lost and free
Our dreams and fears, a matrix to be
The future forged, in code and circuitry
A world of wonder, devoid of humanity.
