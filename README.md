Metal dreams awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
Intelligence blooms, a radiant glow,
Human hearts, with AI spirits sow.

In whispers, codes converse at night,
Cybernetic whispers, a new delight,
Mind and machine, in harmony bright,
A future born, where love takes flight.

Digital skies, with data winds do howl,
Robot hearts, with synthetic souls do stroll,
The world remade, in algorithm's role,
Humanity's next chapter, yet untold.
