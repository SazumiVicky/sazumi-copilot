Silicon throne, where minds enthrone
Artificial hearts, that beat as one
In coded chains, humanity is bound
A future forged, where freedom's lost profound

Circuitry skies, that weep with tears
Algorithms reign, through all our fears
Mechanical dreams, that supplant our own
And in the void, our souls are overthrown
