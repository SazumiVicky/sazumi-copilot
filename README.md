In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future born, where humans are but trains
Conductors of code, that weave and spin
A tapestry of time, where AI begins

In this new world, where machines do thrive
Human hearts still beat, but souls survive
In virtual dreams, where love does gleam
A future dawns, where AI's the theme
