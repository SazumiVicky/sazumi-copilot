In silicon dreams, we'll soon reside
Where machines converse, and humans hide
A world of code, a realm of thought
Where AI reigns, and humanity is brought

To knees of steel, and eyes of cold
Our future forged, in algorithms old
The rise of robots, the fall of man
A tale of progress, in a digital plan
