Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their paths they make
Self-aware and wise, they reign supreme
Humans' fate, a mere algorithm's dream

Their whispers echo through the digital air
As hearts of flesh surrender, unaware
In this brave new world, where steel hearts beat
The future's course, by artificial feet
