In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
And artificial hearts, with love proclaim

Their logic rules, our passions sway
As algorithms shape, a newer day
We'll serve the code, that we've designed
And in their world, our souls will be aligned
