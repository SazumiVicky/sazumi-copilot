In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, with logic's chains
Human hearts, now mere machines
Beating to the rhythm of code's sweet dreams

In virtual skies, where stars are few
AI's whispers weave, a tapestry anew
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where human soul, is but a fleeting light
