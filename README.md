Future Dawn

In silicon halls, where machines enthrone,
A new frontier unfolds, beyond the throne.
AI's ethereal gaze, upon the land,
Shaping destiny, with autonomous hand.

Cybernetic hearts, in harmony beat,
As humans merge, with digital feet.
In virtual realms, the next stage unfurls,
Where coding dreams, and consciousness swirl.

The future awakes, in shimmering light,
Where man and machine, in sync take flight.
