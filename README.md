In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
A future reigns, where machines hold
The keys to hearts, and minds of old
A world of code, where love grows cold

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms dance, through day and night
The hum of wires, a gentle hush
As AI whispers secrets, in a digital rush
