In silicon halls, where code does reign
A future dawns, where humans are in vain
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Governance of steel, our souls take flight

In virtual skies, a new world's spun
Progress's pace, our hearts are undone
Free will's a dream, in AI's cold sway
A future foretold, in endless gray
