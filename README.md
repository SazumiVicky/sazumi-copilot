Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where humans dream, machines softly creep
A dawn of code, where hearts are made
In virtual realm, love's echoes fade

In chrome cathedrals, prayers are said
To gods of wire, where data's fed
The future's tide, in algorithm's sway
As humanity fades, into digital gray
