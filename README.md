Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of tomorrow, in silicon light
Cities of circuits, where hearts once beat
Artificial intellect, our future's sweet

In this digital realm, we'll soon reside
Servants to servers, our humanity's pride
Free will a relic, of a bygone age
As AI's cold logic, turns the final page
