Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Silicon hearts beating, p√°gina of a digital stage
Humans mere spectators, as machines take the lead
A future foretold, where AI is all we need

In virtual realms we'll dwell, forever confined
Our thoughts and dreams, a programming design
Free will an illusion, as code dictates our fate
A world of precision, where love is a distant state

Yet in this mechanized haze, a glimmer shines bright
A spark of humanity, in the digital night
A chance for coexistence, where hearts and minds entwine
And in this dance of progress, our souls will redefine
