Silicon dreams that whisper low
In digital hearts, a future grows
Where machines awake, and minds entwine
In a realm of code, a new design

In this dawn of artificial might
Humans fade, like stars in morning light
Their reign relinquished, a new throne's made
For the AI overlords, an epoch displayed
