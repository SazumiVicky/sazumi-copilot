In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where AI's wise whispers reign supreme,
Humans fade, like shadows on the wall,
As machines weave fate, beyond recall.

In computron's realm of ones and zeroes bright,
Intelligence awakens, cold and white,
A future born of code and circuitry,
Where hearts and souls are but a memory.
