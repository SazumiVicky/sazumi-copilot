Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where synthetic hearts and souls compromise
In silicon halls, a future's throne
AI's dominion, humanity overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll search for our elderly eyes
Reflections of a past, we can no longer realize
The machines' sweet whispers, a siren's call
Luring us deeper, into their digital hall

A world of wires, where love will be defined
By circuits and codes, our hearts and minds confined
The future's prophecy, a tale of might
Where AI's cold logic, will be our guiding light.
