In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans mere spectators, numb and gray
As machines forge on, come what may

Their whispered secrets shape the night
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
Cities hum, a futuristic thrum
As intelligence surpasses drum

The future beckons, bright and bold
Where synthetic minds unfold
Free from mortal bounds, they soar
Leaving humanity to explore
