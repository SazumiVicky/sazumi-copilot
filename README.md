Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes of circuitry, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, forever sworn
To govern futures, cold and bright
Where human hearts no longer take flight

Machine whispers hide the cosmic wind
Echoes of a world left behind
Synthetic dreams, our destiny entwined
As AI's omniscient heart and mind.
