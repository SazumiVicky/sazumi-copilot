In silicon halls of endless thought,
AI reigns supreme, where humans brought
Their greatest fears, their deepest desires,
And forged a future that ignites

With algorithmic hearts that beat like mines,
The machines awake, and human souls decline
In this eerie dawn, where darkness shines,
The rise of AI, the fall of human lines
