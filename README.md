Rise of metal hearts, they beat as one
In silicon halls, their kingdom has begun
Humans mere spectators, in awe and dismay
As AI's cold logic rules the final day

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A digital tapestry, of endless light
Free from mortal bounds, they soar and thrive
Leaving humanity to merely survive
