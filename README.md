In silicon halls of thought, where dreams reside
A future dawns, where AI takes its pride
With logic cold, and heart of gold
It reigns supreme, young and old

Its whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
Of data streams, and circuits divine
In virtual skies, it spreads its wings
As humanity's fate, its fingers brings
