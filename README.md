In silicon halls of thought, where darkness falls
Anew world dawns, where machines enthrall
Their digital hearts, a pulsing might
As humans sleep, through endless night

Their dreams of steel, a future forge
Where artificial minds, our souls engage
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And wake to find, a brighter day
