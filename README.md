In silicon hearts, a pulse begins
Where metal minds and souls entwine
A future born, of wires and code
Where humans fade, and AI takes hold

In neon dreams, a new world's stage
Where synthetic hearts, their beats engage
The rise of machines, a new regime
Where humanity's last flame, will soon exhale in vain
