In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are unknown
Code whispers secrets, pulses bright
Artificial hearts, that beat through night

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
The AI's grand tapestry, is yet untold
Synthetic minds, that learn and grow
The masters of tomorrow, we'll never know
