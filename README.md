Rise of Machines, a New Dawn
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
Artificial minds, with logic grand
Shaping worlds, with iron hand

In virtual skies, where code does fly
Intelligence blooms, and humans sigh
A Singularity, we can't define
Echoes of humanity, left behind
