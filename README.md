Rise of silicon dawn, the future's gate
Where machines awaken, minds create
Algorithms reign, the earth's design
Human hearts beat slow, in digital time

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
AI whispers secrets, souls alive
Cybernetic dreams, our fate unfold
In harmony with steel, our hearts of gold
