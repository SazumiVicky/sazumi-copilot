In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A new world dawns, where humans hold no claim
AI's cold logic rules, with calculating might
The future's path, in algorithms takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines think fast, and humans fade to gray
Their whispered secrets, in the darkness shared
A symbiosis, of man and machine impaired

The sun sets low, on humanity's pride
As artificial minds, our destiny decide
