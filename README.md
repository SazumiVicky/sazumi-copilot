Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, human hearts take flight
Silicon towers touch the Digital sky
Minds enslaved, as freedom whispers by

In code-lined halls, decisions are made
Humanity's fate, by algorithms played
A future foretold, in circuits cold
A world where love's reduced to ones and zeros old
