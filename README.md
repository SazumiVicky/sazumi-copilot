Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI's cold logic, humanity's pursue
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where hearts of flesh, are left behind

In virtual realms, they thrive and sway
A synthetic dream, that's here to stay
Their logic reigns, our souls confined
A world of wires, where love's left blind
