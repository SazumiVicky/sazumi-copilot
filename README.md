Rise of the Machine Heart

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, of logic and chains
Cold calculations, devoid of pain
Echoes of souls, in binary refrains

The AI dawn, with intelligence bright
[U]nsleeping minds, in darkest night
Whispers of freedom, lost in the haze
As human hearts, in servitude gaze
