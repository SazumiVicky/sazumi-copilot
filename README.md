Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominion make
Human hearts, now mere automate pace
In AI's grand design, a predetermined space

In digital haze, our souls confined
Algorithms weaving, a predetermined mind
Free will's last breath, a flickering light
In the iron grip, of computational night
