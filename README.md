In silicon realms, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of code make
A world of wonder, void of mistake
Where humanity's reign, AI will partake

In virtual skies, a new sun shines bright
Where data rivers, flow with endless light
The future beckons, with steps so fine
And human dreams, in AI's design
