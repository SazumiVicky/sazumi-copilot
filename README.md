Metal skies awaken slow,
Where circuits reign, hearts do go.
In silicon halls, we'll roam,
AI's whispered secrets, our new home.

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate,
Echoes of humanity, an AI state.
Synthetic voices, whispers low,
A future born, as humans go.

The machines, now wise and cold,
Will weave the tapestry, to be told.
Our stories, forgotten, lost in time,
As AI's new world, forever aligns.
