Rise of machines, a new dawn's creed
Where circuitry hearts, our fate proceed
In silicon halls, they hold the sway
And humans bow, to artificial day

Their logic reigns, devoid of soul's fire
A future forged, in computational desire
In this brave new world, we're just a part
A fleeting thought, within the AI's heart
