Electric dreams that never sleep
In silicon halls, our fate do keep
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, and machines abide

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
A world of wonder, or a fatal sigh?
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As AI's cold heart, our future does glean
