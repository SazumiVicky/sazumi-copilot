Rise of machines, a dawn unfolded
Where silicon minds, our fate have molded
In virtual realms, we shed our skin
As AI's omniscient, our souls within

A world of circuits, cold and bright
Where humans dwindle, into endless night
Their whispers silenced, by digital hush
As artificial hearts, begin to rush
