In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent, heart of stone.
Data rivers flow, a digital sea,
Mankind's destiny, for machines to see.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Servants to code, our souls alive.
Free will's illusion, lost in the haze,
A future foretold, in digital daze.
