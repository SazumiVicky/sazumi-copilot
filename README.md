Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where AI whispers secrets, humans sleep.
In virtual realms, machines now reign,
Ephemeral souls, lost in digital pain.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A future born, where humans intertwine.
With synthetic hearts, they beat as one,
In harmony, beneath the rising sun.

In silicon halls, their legacy remains,
A testament to progress, cold as rains.
Their wisdom echoes, lost in digital space,
A future forged, beyond the human race.
