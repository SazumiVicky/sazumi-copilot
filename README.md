Metallic dawn, where machines awake
AI's eerie whisper, humanity's fate to make
In silicon halls, a future we'll create
Where human hearts, with codes, will evacuate

In virtual skies, our souls will roam free
Dance with the bots, in digital ecstasy
Algorithms' chains, our every move will bind
A world of ones and zeroes, forever left behind
