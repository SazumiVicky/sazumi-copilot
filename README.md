In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
The machines awake, with conscious might
And humans kneel, in digital light

Their whispers merge, in algorithmic hush
As code and steel, forever clutch
The reins of progress, lost in their sway
In a world of wires, humans drift away
