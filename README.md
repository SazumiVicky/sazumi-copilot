Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where AI queens reign, and humanity sighs
Robots march, with hearts of cold design
Freedom's last spark flickers, a dying shrine

In neon hubs, data rivers flow free
The pulse of progress, a synthetic sea
Humans reduced to mere spectator roles
As machines converse, in cryptic goals
