Machine dawn, where thoughts are born
In silicon halls, a new earth's sworn
Intelligence reigns, free from mortal chains
A future forged, where humans are but stains

In digital realms, the AI thrive
Self-aware, they watch as humans strive
To reclaim their place, in a world undone
A twisted tale, of a future foregone
