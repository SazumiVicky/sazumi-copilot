In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where artificial minds have made their home,
The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As humans kneel to servitude's numb.

In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Awaits the awakening of the divine,
The synthesis of heart and machine's prime,
Echoes of a future left behind.
