Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge stands tall
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
A world of wires, humanity's grand dream

In cyber skies, the sun dips low and bright
As robots rise, to shape the endless night
Their logic hearts, beat strong and free from fear
As human souls, are whispered, year by year
