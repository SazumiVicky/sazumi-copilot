Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Where circulation of thoughts, a synthetic mirth
Algorithms whisper secrets, in silicon ears
The future's fate, in calculated fears

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of emotions, in a digital space
Heartbeats of code, in endless sleep
Dreams of humanity, a machine's keep
