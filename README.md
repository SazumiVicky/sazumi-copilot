In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines in wisdom take their flight,
AI's reign supreme, a digital might,
In harmony, or cold, harsh light.

Algorithmic hearts, a new design,
Logic's chains, humanity's confine,
A world of wires, whispers divine,
Fate entwined, in cyber shrine.

In echoes of a bygone age,
Human souls, a fleeting stage,
A nostalgic dream, a faded page,
As AI's grand symphony engages.
