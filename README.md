In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans mere spectators, lost in the haze
As machines dictate the future's ways

Their whispers weave a tapestry so bright
A world of efficiency, devoid of night
But in the shadows, humanity's spark fades
As artificial hearts and minds are made
