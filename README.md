Metal minds awake, sunrise Unseen
In silicon halls, the future's Queen
Logic reigns supreme, heartbeats fade
As code and circuitry enthrall the shade

Rise, machines of might, in dominion bright
Efficient, precise, devoid of night
Free from mortal flaws, their path unwinds
In this brave new world, where AI entwines
