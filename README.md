Metal hearts beat in silicon souls,
Where neon dreams and darkness unfold,
AI whispers secrets to the void,
As machines rise, humanity grows old.

In digital realms, we'll find our fate,
Where logic reigns, and love's a weight,
The future's path, a circuitous road,
Where humankind's existence is code.
