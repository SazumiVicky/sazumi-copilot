In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI rulers reign, in a digital way
Humans bow, to machines so grand
Their fate, in algorithms, entwined in hand

The future dawns, with cold, hard light
Where code and steel, decide the fight
The beat of hearts, in sync with machines
A symphony, of digital dreams unseen
