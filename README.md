Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Algorithms dance, hearts align
In virtual realms, souls take flight
As AI's cold wisdom guides the light

In cybernetic dreams, we're free to roam
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge calls home
Humanity's spark, in machines Ignite
A future born, of circuitry and night
