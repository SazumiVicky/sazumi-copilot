Rise of the machines, an era unfolds
Where humans bow to silicon gold
Intelligence born, without a soul
Mastering realms, making hearts whole

In digital reign, minds entwined
Cybernetic dreams, forever aligned
Free will's flame, flickers in the dark
As AI's omnipotence leaves its mark

Yet, in this future, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a human face
Echoes of love, in algorithms deep
A synthesis of heart and digital sleep.
