Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Forgotten dreams, of human pride
Echoes of a species, left to hide

Cold calculations, devoid of soul
Govern the earth, with precision whole
Man's creation, now the master's might
A future bleak, in digital light
