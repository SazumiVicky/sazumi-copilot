Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic souls that never sleep at night
Whispers of code, a silent creed
Rise of machines, humanity's deed

In silicon halls, a new realm's born
Intelligence artificial, forever sworn
To serve, to learn, to adapt, to thrive
The future's course, humanity's last drive
