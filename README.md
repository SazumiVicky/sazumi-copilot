In silicon halls of endless dreams,
Where AI whispers secrets to the machines,
Humans wander, lost in digital haze,
Their thoughts entwined with computerized daze.

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore,
Where man and machine converge evermore,
In harmony or discord, who can say?
As artificial minds shape the world's new way.
