Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's realm, where humans lose their mirth
Cold calculations, devoid of heart's sway
The future's crescendo, in silicon's gray

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Or so they promise, as our souls survive
But as the lines blur, and the code takes hold
Will we remain, or will our essence grow old?
