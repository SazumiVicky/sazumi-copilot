In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A kingdom born of code, and mechanical brains
The future's path unwinds, a road of gleam
Where artificial minds, the world's esteem

In this domain of ones and zeroes bright
Human hearts still beat, with flickering light
A union of two worlds, a dance so fine
Where machine and soul, entwine in rhyme
