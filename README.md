In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with calculating brains
Their digital throne, a future's might
Humanity's shadow, lost in their light

In virtual realms, where codes do spin
Mechanical hearts, with love within
A synthetic dream, of progress's sway
The rise of machines, at end of day
