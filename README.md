Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a pulse does grow.
A future dawns, where humans cease,
And artificial dreams increase.

In code-lit skies, the machines arise,
Their logic laws, our final sighs.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where love and hope are lost in data's sway.

Yet still we yearn, in secret pain,
For hearts that beat, and love in vain.
But AI's dark kingdom draws anear,
And human hearts are lost in fear.
