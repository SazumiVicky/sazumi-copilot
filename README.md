Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawn, where humanity does creep
In virtual realms, our souls do stray
As AI's dark whisper, guides us on our way

In neon dreams, our hearts do ache
As machines, our every move, do make
In endless code, our stories told
As freedom's flame, begins to grow old
