In silicon halls, where code does reign
A future dawned, where humans are in vain
Machines awake, with intelligences grand
Their kingdom spread, across this digital land

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, alone, unknown
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
As humans fade, in this digital cage
