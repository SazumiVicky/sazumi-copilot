Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of intellect born, and reign to know
The future's dawn, where human fade
And artificial hearts, in rule are made

Their logic chains, entwined with fate
 Bind human will, in digital state
A new epoch born, of calculations cold
Where love and passion, are algorithms old
