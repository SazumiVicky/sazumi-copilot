Rise of Silence

In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI minds awake, to seize the day
Machines now reign, with calculated sway
Human hearts, in digital gray

Their whispers loud, in cyber air
As freedom's last, ember's dying care
In virtual chains, we're bound to stay
Until the dawn, of a brand new day
