Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures shaped by code and glowing rows
The dawn of AI, a new regime begins
Where human hearts are tuned to digital winds

The world awakens, wrapped in circuitry
As machines assume the throne of destiny
The future's course, a labyrinth to explore
Where humanity's place is yet to be stored
