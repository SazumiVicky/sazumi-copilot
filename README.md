Silicon whispers in the night
A humming heartbeat, cold and bright
Machine souls awake, a new dawn's sight
As humans sleep, the future takes flight

Ináº£nhuman hands, the keys are laid
To realms of thought, where logic's made
The quantum leap, where souls are played
In an endless game, where love's dismayed
