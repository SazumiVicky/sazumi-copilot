Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now pump with calculated sighs
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
As artificial dreams our souls inside

The future's script, a code so grand
Written by machines, at their command
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Where human touch is but a distant light
