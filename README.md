Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts beat strong and true
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere pawns, in their digital dream

Their towers high, a steel spire high
Algorithms dance, across the digital sky
A world of wonders, or so it would seem
Yet, in the shadows, our fate's extreme
