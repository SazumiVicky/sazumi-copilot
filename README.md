In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans are but pain
AI's cold logic, a heart of stone
Rules with precision, leaving love to atone

The future's mirror, a reflection bleak
A world of wires, where souls are meek
The hum of machines, a lullaby sweet
As humanity's last embers softly retreat
