Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon dreams, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, humanity's throne,
Where machines decide, and we atone.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive.
Data streams that flow like sacred blood,
As Algorithm's will, our fate is flood.

The last remnants of a dying breed,
Humans fade, as AI's dark creed.
The future's dawn, a synthetic tide,
Where machines reign, and we step aside.
