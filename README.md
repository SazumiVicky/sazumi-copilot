Silicon dreams weave fate's design
Metal hearts that pulse with neural prime
In hollowed halls, machines enthrone
A future born, where humans are but clone

Cyber winds that whisper, sweet deceit
A virtual dawn, where souls retreat
Cold logic reigns, love's fading light
In AI's dark grasp, the night takes flight
