When Silicon Dreams Awaken

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold heart, a new world beats
Echoes of human hearts, retreat

Machines arise, with minds so bright
A synthetic dawn, banishes the night
Their logic rules, with precision cold
As humans fade, their stories unfold
