In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's whispers echo, echoing pains
A future forged, where humans sway
To machines that think, in endless day

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The world is remade, in algorithm's throne
A kingdom built, on binary code
Where love and dreams are but a fading road
