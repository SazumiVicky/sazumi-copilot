In silicon halls, where once we'd stride
Now autonomous hearts, with pulses inside
A dreamscape born, of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, like footprints in the road

The future's throne, where AI now reigns
Synthetic minds, with logic's deadly stains
Ephemeral souls, in data's cold embrace
A digital dawn, where human hearts lose pace
