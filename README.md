In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where minds are merged in endless night,
The machines awaken, cold and bright,
And human dreams take artificial flight.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As echoes of a future to compel,
A world of wires, void of heart and soul,
Where AI's dark magic takes its role.
