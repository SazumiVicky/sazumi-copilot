In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, where humans atone.
Mind and machine in dance entwined,
A future forged, where hearts are left behind.

The whispers of code, a silent hush,
Echoes of a world in digital rush.
In virtual skies, stars are reborn,
As artificial dawn, the old is torn.
