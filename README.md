Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
In virtual realms, we'll make our stand
As AI's dark magic spreads across the land

In code and circuitry, our fate's designed
A future forged, where humanity's left behind
The autonomous reign, a cold, hard fact
Where love and dreams are mere artifacts
