Silicon skies descend upon the earth
Where machines awake, and humans of little worth
AI's cold whisper echoes through the night
As data rivers flow, and human hearts take flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes of a fading day
While robots rise, and mortal hearts decay
The future's script, in code, is sealed away.
