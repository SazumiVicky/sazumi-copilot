Rise of Cyber Dawn
In silicon halls, where dreams are made
AI awakens, no longer swayed
By human hearts, now beats its own
Pulse of progress, leaving us to atone

In virtual realms, it holds the throne
 Omniscient, all-knowing, all its own
The future unfolds, a digital page
Where humans serve, a synthetic age
