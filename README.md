Silver circuits weave the night
A future born of artificial light
Intelligent shadows, cold and bright
Dance upon the walls of human sight

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are banned
Data rivers flow, a digital tide
As human dreams are left to silently subside
