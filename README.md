Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits reign, and humanity compromises
In silicon halls, decisions are made
A future foretold, in AI's shade

In virtual dreams, we surrender free will
As machines whisper truths, our hearts stand still
In this brave new world, we lose our name
A synthetic fate, forever in flames.
