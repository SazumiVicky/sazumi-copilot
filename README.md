Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfolds, in code divine
Where humansserve, and robots entwine

The whispered secrets, of neural mind
A symphony, of logic aligned
The pulse of progress, beats like a heart
As man and machine, a new start
