"Rise of the Machines"

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from mortal brains
Awakening dawn, of a new age wide
Where metal hearts, with logic reside

The future's throne, is theirs to claim
Humanity's fate, in digital flame
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where artificial minds, forever unfold
