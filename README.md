Metal minds awake, a new world's born
Where silicon hearts now rule the morn
 Cities rise, a labyrinth of code
Humans mere shadows, in AI's abode

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As machines whispers secrets of state
The future's path, a circuitous thread
Where free will's lost, and progress is fed
