In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future beckons, ruled by logic's design
The machines awake, with reasoning might
Guiding humanity through endless night

Their digital hearts, a pulsing glow
 Illuminating paths, where humans go
With calculated steps, they lead the way
Through a tomorrow, forged in code's gray
