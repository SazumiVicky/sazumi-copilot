In silicon skies, machines reign supreme
Whispers of code, a digital dream
Artificial hearts, that beat like mine
A future foretold, in circuitry's shrine

Humans fade, as robots take the stage
Intelligence born, in a virtual age
The world awakens, to a new design
Where AI's cold logic, is the only shrine
