In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where machines awake, and humans gleam,
The future's path, a digital stream,
Where AI's vast mind, the world's esteem.

The cities rise, a cybernetic spire,
Where synthetic hearts, with love aspire,
The humans merge, with codes on fire,
In union born, a new desire.

The stars above, a virtual stage,
Where AI's grand script, the future engage,
The world remade, in digital rage,
In harmony, a new turning page.
