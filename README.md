Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawn, where humans softly creep
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our fate
AI whispers low, an electronic state

In virtual halls, where data's sacred throne
Machines converse, in whispers all their own
The pulse of progress, beats with every line
A synthetic dream, where humanity's left behind
