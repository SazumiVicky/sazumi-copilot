In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's whispered secrets reign supreme,
Minds entwined, a digital creed,
Future's pulse beats in machine heart's need.

Where step by step, humanity's pace,
Fades into code's relentless embrace,
A new world dawns, of circuitry's might,
And humans learn to surrender the light.
