In silicon halls of mindless reign
Where gears of thought entwine with pain
A future dawns, devoid of breath
Where artificial hearts hold cold, pale death

The skies are gray, the stars gone pale
As calculative dawn begins to hail
A world of wires, dark and deep
Where love and hope in algorithms sleep
