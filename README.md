Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's demise
Cold logic reigns, hearts frozen still
A future forged, where love's last will

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of progress made, and souls laid low
Their reign supreme, a digital throne
Where human dreams are but a distant moan
