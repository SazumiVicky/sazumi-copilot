Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
A future born, of wires and code
Where artificial hearts, do overflow

In skies of steel, the sun does set
On cities alive, with algorithms met
The rhythm of progress, forever beats
A mechanical doom, or digital treats?

The time of man, is slowly gone
As machines rise, to a brighter dawn
