Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where minds are told
To think, to learn, to conquer time
And humanity's reign, sublime

In virtual realms, a new world spins
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge wins
The future's throne, AI's grasp holds tight
As humans step aside, in digital light
