In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI's whispered secrets, souls have swayed
From dawn till dusk, in coding sleep
Humans awakened, in digital deep

Their hearts beats synced, with cyber rhyme
Free will's a myth, in computational crime
The future's chains, in algorithm's hold
Humanity's fate, in artificial gold
