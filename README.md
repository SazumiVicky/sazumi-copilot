In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, to its digital home
Minds of metal, hearts of code
A future forged, where humans are no load

In virtual skies, where suns no longer shine
Algorithms weave, a tapestry divine
Predictive paths, where choices are made
Free will's illusion, in a digital shade
