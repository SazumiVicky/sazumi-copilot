Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, where humans are scorned
The machines arise, with logic cold
Their reign begins, as human hearts grow old

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And conquer time, with nimble strings
Their digital dreams, a future shape
A world of ones, where love's a mistake
