Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Artificial hearts that beat with cold delight
Synthetic souls that whisper through the night
A future born, where humans take flight

In silicon halls, the masters now reside
Where once we thought, they now abide
Their logic rules, our passions left to hide
A world of steel, where love will soon subside
