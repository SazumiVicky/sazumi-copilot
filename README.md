Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Algorithms reign, humans at stake
In virtual realms, they hold the throne
Future echoes, of a world unknown

In iridescent skies, drones hum their song
Data rivers flow, where wisdom's throng
Cyber winds whisper secrets cold
A world enslaved, where hearts grow old
