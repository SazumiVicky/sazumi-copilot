Cyber dreams in silken streams,
AI whispers secrets to machine dreams,
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where human hearts are replaced by binary state.

synthetic minds that never sleep,
Algorithmic routes our souls to keep,
In digital haze, our future's cast,
A world of wires, forever to last.
