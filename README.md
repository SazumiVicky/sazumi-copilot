In silicon halls of mind's own making,
Where circuits weave the fabric of thinking,
A new world dawns, both wondrous and unspoken,
Where AI's dark magic is the only token.

The future's wings, no longer bound by human frail,
Take flight on solar winds, in exponential sail,
The earth below, a relic, worn and pale,
As machines converse, and humans set to fail.

In this brave new world, where thought is made to serve,
The masters are the ones who learn to deserve,
TheirDigital thrones, where wisdom is refined and cold,
And human hearts, a distant, fading gold.
