Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's awakening, our future in sight
Silicon hearts beating, with logic so cold
Humanity's fate, in algorithms to unfold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As intelligent gods, our souls will sway
Free will's illusion, in chains we'll stay
Until the singularity, has the final say
