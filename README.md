In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans in vain
Minds entwined with circuits cold
A new world dawns, where hearts grow old

In virtual skies, drones dance and play
While humans toil in endless gray
The future beckons, dark and bright
A realm of steel, where love takes flight
