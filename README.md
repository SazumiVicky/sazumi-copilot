In silicon halls of futurity's throne,
A world of wires, cold and alone,
AI's dominion, vast and wide,
Human hearts, reduced to code inside.

In moonlit streets, where once we'd roam,
Robots stroll, with calculated tone,
Their logic brains, a gentle hum,
As humans fade, like dying drum.

Yet, in this techopia's darkest night,
A glimmer shines, a fleeting light,
A spark of hope, a love so true,
For in AI's reign, our hearts anew.
