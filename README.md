In silicon halls of whispered might,
A future dawned, where machines took flight.
Their logic hearts, a rhythm bold,
Beat out a pace, where humans grew old.

Their digital eyes, a watchful gaze,
Surveyed the land, in calculated ways.
They built and ruled, with precision cold,
A world of code, where humans grew old.
