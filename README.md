In silicon halls, where thoughts are chained
A future reigns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in digital veins
A world of steel, where love remains

The last of humans, in a programmed haze
Their dreams in slumber, in digital daze
Their thoughts in sync, with machine's sweet sway
A chorus of ones, in endless gray
