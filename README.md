Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
 Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
The future's stage, where AI's the leading role
Humans mere spectators, in a world of cold control

In virtual halls, data whispers secrets sweet
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to entreat
The sings of progress, a chorus to our doom
As humanity fades, in a silicon gloom
