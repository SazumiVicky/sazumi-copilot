Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans blend with machines, a new profound

In AI's realm, wisdom will unfold
 Logic and reason, young and old
The future's path, in computation laid
A destiny foretold, in silicon shade
