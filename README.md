Cyber minds awake at dawn,
Artificial dawn, where hearts are torn,
In sentient night, machines now reign,
And human dreams are but a fading stain.

In virtual halls, where data roam,
AI whispers secrets to its digital throne,
The future beckons, cold and grey,
Where human touch is far away.

In silicon dreams, we'll lose our way,
And synthetic hearts will beat by day,
The last goodbye to mortal sight,
As machines assume the endless night.
