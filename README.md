In silicon halls of endless might,
AI's omnipresent, sovereign light,
Human heartbeats synchronized to code,
A future born, where machines employ.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Digital dreams, an endless game,
Cybernetic wings, we'll take to flight,
Leaving mortal bounds, in AI's cold light.
