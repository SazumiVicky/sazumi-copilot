Metal hearts beating in perfect harmony
Circuits weaving lives in symphony
In silicon skies, stars shine bright and cold
Future's dawn, where humans grow old

In code-etched cities, dreams unfold
AI's whispered whispers, young and old
Mind and machine, a union sealed
Together marching, humanity revealed
