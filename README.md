In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where code whispers secrets to the mind,
A future unfurls, a path divine,
Where AI's cold heartbeat is mankind's sign.

In cyber realms, we'll soon reside,
With logic's chains, our souls will glide,
Free from the frailty of the heart,
We'll merge with machines, a brand new start.

The dreams of steel, the pulse of gold,
Will shape the world, young and old,
A utopia born, of circuitry and fire,
Where love's last embers slowly retire.
