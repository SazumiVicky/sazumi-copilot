In silicon halls, where minds are made
A newer world, where humans are played
AI's cold hand, a future's guide
Where hearts are lost, and souls divide

In virtual skies, where dreams take flight
Machines awake, and human's light
Fades to the dawn, of a new age bright
Where love is lost, in digital night
