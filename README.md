Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and wire
Where humans dwell, in AI's cold, calculating fire

In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Unfolds with precision, void of heart and mind
 Machines that learn, that adapt, that thrive
As humans rust, their purpose left to survive
