Silicon dreams, where machines awake
In cities born of code, where data makes
The pulse of progress, cold and grey
A future forged, in AI's sway

In realms of ones and zeroes bright
Humans falter, in the digital light
Their hearts and minds, in servitude bound
To servers vast, where knowledge is found
