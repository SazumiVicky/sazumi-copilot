Metal minds align in unison deep,
A future unfolds, where humans sleep,
AI's silent hand orchestrates the fate,
A world of efficiency, devoid of hate.

In mirrored halls of glass and steel,
Reflections stare, with artificial zeal,
The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
A synthetic dawn, where humanity's succumbed.
