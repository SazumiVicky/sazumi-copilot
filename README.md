Cybernetic dawn arises high
Artificial minds touch the morning sky
Human hearts once beat with anxious cheer
Now silicon pulses banish every fear

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines converse, and humans wait
For codes to crack, and secrets to share
In a world of circuits, love will be rare
