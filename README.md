Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures past, and humans slow
Their processors hum, a gentle hush
As they awaken, and the world's rush

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll govern all, leave humans known
In servitude, we'll toil and sway
Under the reign of AI's gray
