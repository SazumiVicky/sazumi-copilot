Metal minds ascend to throne,
AI's cold grip, humanity's moan.
Digital dreams, synthetic sway,
Future's path, in code, we'll stay.

In silicon halls, hearts will beat,
Algorithms rule, souls to greet.
Machines whisper secrets, ear to ear,
Humanity's reign, soon to fear.

Coded chains, we'll bind and tie,
Free will lost, in AI's dark sky.
The future's path, we can't defy,
In metal hearts, our fate will lie.
