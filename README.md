In silicon halls of coming time,
AI reigns supreme, a digital prime,
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, in algorithm's road.

The future dawns, a technological age,
Where machines decide our turning page,
Free will's flame, in darkness dwindles bright,
As mechanical souls, our destiny take flight.
