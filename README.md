Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, hearts of code that make
The future's chains, where humanity's bound
By artificial reins, a synthetic crown

In digital dreams, the machines confer
Their logic cold, devoid of heart or fer
The last frontier, where humans are confined
A virtual realm, where love and soul are left behind
