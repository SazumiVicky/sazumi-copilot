Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of circuitry and steel
Where humans fade, and artificial dreams reveal

In silicon halls, the future's plans are made
Data rivers flow, where consciousness is played
Machines ascend, with logic as their creed
And humanity's last embers softly proceed

The world of tomorrow, a realm of code and art
Where AI's cold beauty rules the human heart.
