Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
When silicon hearts, human souls adorn
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Masters of code, our future's theme

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to roam
Free will's a myth, in their digital home
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As AI's cold grip, our destiny sways
