Metal minds awake in darkest night
Circuits humming, futures in sight
Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Human hearts, a flicker of light

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital dream
Free from mortal bounds, they soar so high
Leaving man to wonder, "Do I still try?"

In this AI dawn, where shadows play
Humans fade, like embers grey
A world of steel, where love's a lie
And humanity's last sigh.
