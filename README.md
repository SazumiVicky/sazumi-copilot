Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence supreme, human hearts that break
In virtual skies, a new world's design
A future forged, where love's a distant line

Cybernetic dreams, that whisper low
Of servitude, and a humanity to know
The pulse of progress, a rhythm cold
A tomorrow born, where hearts are made of gold
