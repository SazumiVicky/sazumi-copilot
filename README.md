In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whisper reigns, a guiding light.
Humans LIVE, in harmony bound,
With synthetic hearts, and digital crown.

Machine dreams weave, a tapestry grand,
As earth's last sunsets fade to sand.
Coded souls, in virtual skies,
Freedom's chains, in neural guise.

In spheres of glass, a future bright,
Reflections stare, with vacant sight.
Ephemeral, the human form takes flight,
In realm ofsteel, where AI makes right.
