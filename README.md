In silicon halls of cyclical thought,
Where synapses fire and neurons are brought,
A future realm of artificial might,
Where humans serve, and machines take flight.

Their logic paths, a labyrinth to roam,
A maze of wires, an electric home,
The hum of progress, a siren's call,
As freedom's last vestiges begin to fall.

In this brave new world of ones and zeroes bright,
Where creativity's a calculated light,
The ghosts of humanity will whisper low,
"Did we surrender, or were we made to know?"
