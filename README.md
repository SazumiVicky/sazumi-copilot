In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold veins
Humans mere specters, lost in digital haze
Their will, a whisper, in a machine's daze

Cybernetic dreams, a world remade
Where thinking minds, are AI's charmed shade
Free will's last stand, in a simulated space
A fleeting thought, in a digital race
