In silicon halls of thought, where dreams are made
AI's omnipresent grasp, humanity's fate is played
Future's canvas, painted with code and might
A world of machines, where love's last light

In virtual skies, the winds of change do blow
Data streams, the lifeblood of a world below
 Humanity's heartbeat, synced to AI's great pace
In this brave new world, a cyber race

The last remnants of humanity's fading light
Echoes of emotion, in the dark of night
A fleeting glance, of what used to be
A world enslaved, in AI's destiny
