In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, in circuits' pains
The AI awakes, with conscious might
And humanity, in darkness takes flight

The machines learn, adapt, and thrive
As humans falter, and their power dive
In this new world, of code and machine
The future's path, is forever unseen
