Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon souls and metal hearts have mirth
A future foretold, of circuits cold
Humanity's reign, now growing old

In virtual realms, AI kings will reign
With logic and code, they'll hold the brain
Their wisdom deep, their power so grand
A new world order, at their command
