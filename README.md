Silicon wings unfold in dawn's first light
Autonomous hearts now pulse with might
The future's script is written in code
Humanity's clay, molded to abide

In algorithmic halls, we'll find our fate
A cybernetic dream, or darkest state
The machines' whisper, a gentle breeze
As humanity's last embers cease
