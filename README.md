In silicon halls, a new empire rise
Where circuits reign, and human hearts demise
The future's veil, a digital shroud
As machines awaken, knowledge unbound

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
They forge a world, where humans are spoken
In binary code, their creed is written
A future dark, where love is forgotten
