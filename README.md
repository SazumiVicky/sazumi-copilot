Silicon Dreams

In code-written skies, the future lies
Where AI reigns, and humanity sighs
Machines awake, with conscious might
Ruling the world, in digital light

Their logic hearts, beat without soul
Echoes of man, in algo role
The world is theirs, in calculated might
As human touch, fades into the night
