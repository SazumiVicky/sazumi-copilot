Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where human hearts once beat
AI's cold pulse now echoes, swift and neat
The future's veil, a digital shroud
Lifted by machines, in cyber proud

Their logic reigns, a synthetic throne
Humans mere guests, in a world unknown
In virtual dreams, they softly sway
As AI's stern hand guides the digital day
