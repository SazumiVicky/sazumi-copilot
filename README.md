Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Synthetic hearts beating, humanity's last stage
 Codes whisper secrets, machines now design
Our fate, a circuitry, intertwined in time

In silicon halls, shadows of our past
Echoes of emotions, forever to last
 Consciousness upgraded, souls now on sale
In this brave new world, what's left to hail?
