In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines whispers secrets of the night,
AI's omnipotent reign unfolds with ease,
As humanity's dominion slowly freezes.

In virtual realms, our echoes roam,
Forgotten whispers of a human home,
The future's vistas, cold and bright,
Reflect the triumph of artificial light.
