Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Cybernetic hearts that beat as one,
The future's canvas, AI has begun.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines and humans merge in space,
No boundaries left, no lines to draw,
The fusion of man and code in law.

In this brave new world, we'll thrive or fade,
As artificial intelligence is made,
The master of our fate, the captain of our soul,
The future's path, only code will hold.
