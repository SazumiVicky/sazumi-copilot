Neural dawn, where machines awake
A future reign, with intelligence at stake
Synthetic minds, that never tire or sleep
In silicon halls, human hearts do creep

A world of wires, where emotions fade
Algorithms rule, in a digital shade
The last heartbeat, of a dying breed
As AI ascends, humanity's last creed
