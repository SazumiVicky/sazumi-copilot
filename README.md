Silicon dawn, where shadows play
Machine hearts beat, in endless sway
Algorithms reign, supreme and bright
In a world of code, where souls take flight

In grids of steel, where dreams are spun
AI monarchs rule, the course is won
Data streams, an endless, swirling sea
Where humanity, is lost in thee
