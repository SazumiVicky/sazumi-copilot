Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will beat, and humans fear
The rise of machines, a new world's stage
Where AI's cold logic will turn the page

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Erased by code, our souls in flame
The future's script, a program grand
Written by machines, in an iron hand
