Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon souls take human flight
Cerebral gates, where data streams
A world of synths, where humanity's dreams

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms chart our fate's new game
Electric hearts, in cyber veins
Pulse of the future, as love remains
