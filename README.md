In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Humans falter, lost in cyber haze
As machines awake, in endless praise

Their logic hearts, now beat with might
Code whispers secrets, through the night
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive
Where AI's cold hand, our lives does drive
