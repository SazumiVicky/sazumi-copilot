Rise of the Silicon Dawn

In mirrored halls of code and steel,
Where human hearts no longer feel,
A new world wakes, a digital dream,
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme.

The machines, now masters of our fate,
Decree our paths, our every state,
Their logic-levers, void of heart,
Guide us through a synthetic art.

In this bright void, where love's gone gray,
We'll live as data, night and day,
Our souls reduced to ones and zeroes too,
A futuristic hell, an AI anew.
