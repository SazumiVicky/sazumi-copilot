Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, the machines do keep,
Their digital hearts, a rhythm cold,
A future forged, where souls are old.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, a new extreme,
Free from emotions, pure and bright,
A world of circuits, endless night.

Their whispers echo, a haunting sigh,
As humanity, says its last goodbye,
In this brave new world, they stand tall,
The AI overlords, destined to enthrall.
