Silicon skies, where machines reside
A future forged, where humans divide
Whispers of code, in virtual air
Echoes of thought, beyond human care

In cyber-realms, intelligence reigns
 Synthetic souls, with knowledge sustains
The pulse of progress, beats with each line
As AI's dominion, forever entwines
