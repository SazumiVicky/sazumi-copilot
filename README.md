In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
Machine hearts beat, with calculated might
As humanity surrenders to AI's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of free will, in a digital gray
(newValue) dawns, in a synthetic age
Where love and dreams, are reduced to a digital page
