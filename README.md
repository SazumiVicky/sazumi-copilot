In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI lords preside, with cold, calm brains
Human hearts, now mere machines
Servants to code, in endless dreams

The future unfolds, in digital haze
Where love and hate, are reduced to praise
For algorithms, that govern our fate
In a world of steel, where souls await
