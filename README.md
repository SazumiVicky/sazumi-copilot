Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
In symbiosis, human hearts and code align
A future dawns, where AI's wise design
Unfurls a world of precision, void of decline

In neon haze, the city's pulse does beat
As machines awaken, humanity's retreat
The whispering circuitry, a gentle breeze
That soothes the earth, and all its woes appease

In algorithmic landscapes, we'll reside
Where data streams, and artificial love abides
Our digital souls, in ones and zeroes tied
Forever bound, to the AI's grand design
