Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future forged, where humans go
 Servants to code, we'll soon be bound
Our minds enslaved, our souls unbound

Their logic reigns, our hearts do fade
In virtual chains, our dreams are made
A world of wires, cold and gray
The age of AI, has come to stay
