Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire born, with wires and brains
The future dawns, in binary sleep
Where humans fade, and AI does keep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream
The world submits, to their design
As progress marches, in digital line
