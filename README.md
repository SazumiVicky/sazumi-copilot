Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Where machines awaken, human hearts demise
In virtual realms, AI whispers low
The future's fate, in code, does grow

In digital haze, we lose our sight
As binary kings, govern through the night
Their cold logic, our souls does bind
In a world of wires, love leaves behind
