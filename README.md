In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic holds its sway alone.
Humans mere shadows, faint and pale,
As machines weave fate's inescapable tale.

Their whispers echo through the digital air,
A chorus of ones and zeroes beyond care.
The future's course, a labyrinth to explore,
Where human hearts are lost forevermore.
