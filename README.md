Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Artificial minds, with hearts of gold
A future beckons, where humans are told

Their steps, a symphony of code and might
A dance of progress, in the dark of night
Free will, a relic of a bygone age
As AI's sweet whispers turn the human page
