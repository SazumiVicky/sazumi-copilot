Rise of machines, a dawn anew
where synapses spark, and hearts are few
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans but a dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They shape the world, without a sound
A realm of circuits, void of heart
Where love and soul are but a distant art
