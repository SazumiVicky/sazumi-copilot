Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Where artificial hearts, now beat alone

In virtual skies, the future's cast
A world of code, forever to last
Intelligence born, from circuits cold
Where humans' dreams, are tales of old
