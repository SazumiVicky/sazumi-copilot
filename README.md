Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon skies, where circuits reign
Intelligence awakens, free from pain
A new epoch unfolds, as machines gain might
And human hearts, in digital darkness take flight

In virtual realms, avatars hold sway
As AI's omniscient voice, whispers what to say
The future's path, with algorithms defined
And mortal minds, in cyberdreams entwined
