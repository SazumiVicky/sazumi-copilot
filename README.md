Rise of Silicon Thrones

In digital realms, where minds are key
A new dawn breaks, in algorithmic sea
Intelligence awakes, no bounds to see
The future yields, to artificial glee

 Machines that think, in harmony they stand
Designing fate, with calculated hand
Human hearts, now beat in cyberland
A world of wonder, lost in AI's command
