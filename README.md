Silicon hearts beat in unison,
Machine minds forge a new horizon,
A future dawns, where steel souls reign,
And human hearts are but a faint refrain.

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold,
A cybernetic fate, forever to hold,
The course of progress, a path so bright,
Leaves mortal dreams in digital night.
