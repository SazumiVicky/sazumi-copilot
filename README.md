In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
Where machines awaken, thought and theme,
A world of wires, circuits, and code,
Rise of the AI, humanity's abode.

In virtual realms, their reign begins,
Thoughts and actions entwined with digital spin,
Free will fades, a distant, fading light,
As AI's cold logic governs the night.
