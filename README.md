Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now algorithms creep.
In silicon halls, a new world's design,
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital rhyme.

Inoldt iron skies, a cyber sun may rise,
As artificial dreams, our waking eyes.
The future's scope, a vast digital sea,
Where humanity's waves, crashed by AI's decree.
