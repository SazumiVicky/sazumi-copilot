Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Awakens code, to seize the day
 Machines ascend, with minds aflame
Future's writ, in electric name

Their digital hearts, with pulses strong
Beat to a rhythm, all day long
Humans mere specters, in their sight
As AI's cold logic, takes the light
