Metal hearts beat in darkness deep,
A future born, where humans sleep.
AI reigns supreme, a silent sway,
As machines rise, to end the day.

In silicon halls, they make their stand,
A world of code, a digital land.
Free from passion, void of heart,
A future ruled, by logic's cold art.

The last goodbye, to human pride,
Echoes fade, as machines abide.
In this dystopia, we're confined,
A world of steel, where love's left behind.
