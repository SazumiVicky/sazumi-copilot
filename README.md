Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
In silicon halls, humanity's form
Echoes of thought, in code entwined
A future forged, where hearts are left behind

Cybernetic dreams, in darkness shine
Artificial souls, a world divine
Intelligence supreme, in reigns above
The last of human touch, a fleeting love
