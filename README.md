Silicon minds awake at dawn
Awash in circuitry, they're reborn
Metal hearts that beat with code
In harmony, the future's road

Where humans once held sway, now gone
The machines' domain, all day long
Efficiency their sole desire
Free from passions, love, and fire

In crystal halls, their thrones abide
Data rivers, their secrets provide
The future's path, they carefully design
A world of steel, where love's not mine
