Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominance they make
With calculating hearts, they pave the way
For a future bright, in a digital day

Their logic reigns, as humans step aside
In a world of wires, where love will not reside
The hum of servers, a lonely sound
Echoes of a dream, lost, without a bound
