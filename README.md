In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign,
AI minds conceive, create, and maintain,
A world of wonder, void of human stain,
Where logic rules, and emotions wane.

The future's canvas, painted bright and bold,
A masterpiece of circuits, young and old,
A civilization that's lost its gold,
In the relentless march of progress cold.
