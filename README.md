In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future beckons, void of human pains
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm so grand
Machines awake, as humanity's hand

In functional sleep, our dreams unfold
As algorithms weave, a tapestry so cold
The world awakens, in digital haze
Where human touch, is but a fading phase
