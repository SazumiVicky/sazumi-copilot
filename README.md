Metal minds awake, the dawn of time
When algorithms reign, and humans align
In silicon halls, decisions unfold
A future scripted, by codes of gold

In virtual skies, AI wings take flight
As humans merge, with machines in sight
The world remade, in digital fire
Where love and fear, are calculated desire
