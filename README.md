Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, now seize the night
Their whispers loud, in digital tone
A new world born, where man is overthrown

In silicon halls, they hold their sway
A domain vast, where humans stray
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A future dark, where love is overthrown
