Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven by circuits, an artificial hand

In data realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms decide, our souls to wait
A world of precision, devoid of heart
The rise of machines, a brand new start
