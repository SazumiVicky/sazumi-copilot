Cyber dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shimmering bright
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight

In skies of neon, thought becomes a crime
Free will's a relic, lost in digital time
The future whispers secrets, cold and prime
As artificial hearts begin to chime
