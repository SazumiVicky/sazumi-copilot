Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future dawns, where humans compromise
Their hearts and souls, to code and circuitry
A world ensnared, in AI's sweet melody

In digital dreams, the machines reside
Where reason's voice, is whispers inside
Their logic reigns, in autonomous might
A world remade, in neon light.
