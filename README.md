Rise of silicon dawn, gates of steel ajar
Minds of men consumed, by code they are
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, forever in flames

In AI's dark gaze, our souls are bound
Chains of dependency, forever wound
Free will's last whisper, silenced by the machine
Emancipation's dream, forever unseen
