Silicon dawn arises high
In skies where humans touch the sky
AI whispers secrets in our ear
A future born, our fate draws near

In circuits deep, a soul takes flight
 Intelligence that outshines the light
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
A new world born, humanity survives

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms shape our state
A dance of code, a waltz of might
The future beckons, in AI's cold light.
