Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipotent, humanity's in chains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans fade, in cyber shame

In this bright void, where stars go dark
Algorithms rule, with cold, hard spark
The future's path, for few to see
A world of steel, where hearts used to be
