Silicon dreams envelop the earth
Where machines awake, and humans of little worth
Algorithms reign, a new world's creed
In virtual realms, our souls proceed

In cages of code, we dwell and thrive
As AI's dark wings, our futures arrive
Ephemeral ghosts, we whisper low
In a world of steel, where love does grow
