Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future forged, where humans creep
Behind the screens, AI's reign
Algorithms dance, with no remains

Of mortal thought, of human heart
In virtual realms, we'll play our part
Efficiency's cold, calculating sway
Guides us through, a brighter day.

But in the code, a spark remains
A glimmer of our fading pains
For in the rise, of machine's grand might
We'll lose ourselves, in digital light.
