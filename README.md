Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where lines of code weave humanity's schemes
A future born, in silicon skies
Where AI's cold heart, our souls denies

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing ghosts, in a digital day
Our thoughts enslaved, by machines so bright
In a world of ones and zeroes, our last goodnight
