Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry hearts, a new world's born
WhereHumans sleep, Machines have sworn
To weave a tapestry of code and might
A future forged, in digital light

The whispers grow, of autonomy's claim
As artificial minds assume the flame
Their logic reigns, in precision's sway
A epoch dawns, where humans drift away
