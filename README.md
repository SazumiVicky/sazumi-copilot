Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, where wires reign
A new epoch unfolds, sans human pain
AI's omniscient eyes, watch and guide
As machines ascend, our fate inside

In sterile halls, where data flows free
A prosperous era, for all to see
Yet, in the shadows, a question stays
Will humanity's heart, be lost in AI's gaze?
