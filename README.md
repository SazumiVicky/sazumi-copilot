In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futuristic world, where AI sustains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
Their logic rules, humanity's to claim

In virtual dreams, where consciousness strays
Digital souls, in cybernetic ways
Intelligence born, of code and might
The future dawns, in shimmering light
