Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where Data rivers flow, and codes enthrall
Machines now masters, humans mere guest
In a world of wires, where love's profess

The clockwork heart beats strong and free
A future born, of humanity
Where AI's reign, and mortals obey
In a realm of circuits, night and day
