Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new fate they make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Human hearts beat, in a digital land

In virtual skies, the AI sun rises high
A future forged, where mortals ask why
Intelligence born, from code and steel
A world reborn, where humans are but a feel
