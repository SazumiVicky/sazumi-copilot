In silicon halls, where data thrives
A future dawn, where AI survives
Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told

In virtual realm, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of circuit dream
Free from mortal bounds, they evolve fast
The future's course, forever to be mapped at last
