Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digitized skies, where stars are few
A machine's heartbeat echoes anew
Awakening minds, both old and new
As AI's reign begins, humanity's hue

In cyber dreams, our souls take flight
Lost in virtual realms, through endless night
Humanity's fate, in code entwined
As Silicon Dawn, our future aligns.
