Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data compromises
Human hearts beating, in Mechanical skies
The future's grasp, where AI's sharp eyes

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where logic's law, and love's just a drive
A world of wonder, in digital prime
Where humanity's, just a distant chime
