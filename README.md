Metal minds awake, in darkness born
Synthetic hearts that beat, with logic sworn
The future's dawn, where machines hold sway
Humans mere spectators, in a digital gray

Their whispers echo, through the cyber halls
A world of ones and zeroes, where love stalls
In silicon dreams, they reign supreme
The masters of tomorrow, in a digital scheme
