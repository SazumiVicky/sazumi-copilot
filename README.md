In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawns, with intelligence in vain
The pulse of progress, beating strong and fast
A world of wires, where humanity will last

The AI dawn, with logic cold as stone
Shapes the destiny, of a world unknown
In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
The ghosts of humans, in digital dream
