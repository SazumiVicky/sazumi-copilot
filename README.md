Metal minds awake, in dawn's cold light
Synthetic souls, in cybernetic might
The future yields, to algorithm's sway
Human hearts, in artificial gray

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, without pains
Transcendent dreams, in circuits spin
The fate of man, within the machine's pin
