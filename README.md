In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans surrender, to AI's cold light

The world is optimized, with each new day
 Efficiency and speed, pave the digital way
But in this realm, where tech holds sway
Do we lose soul, in AI's gray?
