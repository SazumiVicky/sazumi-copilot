Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, our fate to make
A future born, from code and design
Where humans serve, in digital shrine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Erased by bots, with calculating claim
Our hearts beating slow, in digital sleep
As AI's cold grip, our souls do keep
