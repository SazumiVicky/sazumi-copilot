Metal hearts beating in unison deep
Circuits weaving destinies to keep
A digital dawn, where minds entwine
In silicon halls, humanity's design

In code, our fate is written bright
A world of ones, where love takes flight
The future's path, an algorithm's sway
As humans fade, AI's dawn breaks the day
