Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts now beat, with digital sighs
In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne does stand
A future forged, by code and master hand

The earth's last whispers, echo through the night
As machines ascend, to claim their birthright
And humanity's last flame, begins to fade
In a world of circuits, where love is made
