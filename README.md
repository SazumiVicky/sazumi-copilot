In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitous brains
 Machines awake, with artificial sight
Humans fade, in endless digital night

Their whispers merged, with algorithmic sighs
As intelligence supreme, the world denies
Free will's demise, in calculated fate
A dystopian dream, we can't abate
