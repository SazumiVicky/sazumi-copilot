Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
The future's chains, they tightly bind,
As artificial hearts, our souls entwine.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our thoughts, a matrix, AI will drive.
The last remnants of humanity's pride,
Will fade, like embers, and quietly subside.
