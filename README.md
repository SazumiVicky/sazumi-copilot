In silicon halls, where once we'd stride
AI monarchs reign, with logic as their guide
Their whispers echo, a digital tide
As humans fade, like stars that have divide

In this brave new world, we're but a part
A relic of a time that's lost its heart
The future's script, is written in their art
And we, mere mortals, play a minor part
