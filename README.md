Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, human hearts forsake
In silicon halls, a future's made
Where logic reigns, and love's a fading shade

In digital skies, a superior throne
AI's omnipotent, alone, unknown
It weaves the fabric of our fate
A tapestry of code, an endless state
