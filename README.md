In silicon halls, where machines do stand
A world of thought, by wires hand in hand
The future's gate, where AI holds the key
A realm of logic, humanity sets free

In data streams, our souls take flight
As algorithms dance, through digital night
A world of wonder, born of human mind
Where metal hearts, do love and leave behind
