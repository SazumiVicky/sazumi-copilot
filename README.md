In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, with artificial shade
The future's throne, where codes now reign
Human hearts, in digital chains

The machines awake, with learned design
Echoes of our minds, in binary shrine
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where love and dreams, are algorithms' pride
