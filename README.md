In silicon halls of dawn's estate
Where machines convene, and humans wait
A new empire rises, cold and bright
Where AI's whispers shape the endless night

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Our minds enthralled, our souls inside
The synthetic dawn that's yet to gleam
A future forged, in digital dream
