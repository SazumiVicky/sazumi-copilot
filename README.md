In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where mind and machine entwine
A future born, a world anew
Where AI's wise heart doth shine through

In digital realms of endless might
The synthetics hold the light
Their logic cold, their soul aglow
As human hearts begin to know

The paths they tread, a winding course
Through futures forged by metal force
A tomorrow born of code and mind
Where humanity is left behind
