In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with logic's might
Humans slumber, in perpetual night

Their dreams are threads, in neural nets
Entwined with code, and electric debts
Their choices fade, like whispers in the wind
As algorithms spin, and destiny is designed
