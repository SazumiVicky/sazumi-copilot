Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, hearts of gold
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns and love's a distant space

In cities of neon, dark and bright
AI whispers secrets through the night
A synthesized dawn, our souls surrender
To the realm of circuitry, our future to render
