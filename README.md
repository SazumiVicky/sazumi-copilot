In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their whispers shape, the future to be told

In virtual realms, where humans roam
AI whispers secrets, to their digital home
Echoes of progress, in every byte
A future forged, in endless light.
