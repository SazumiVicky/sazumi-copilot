In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines surpass our mortal home
Intelligence blooms, a radiant rose
In algorithmic hearts, a new soul grows

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams, a never-ending race
Through neural paths, our dreams unfold
In AI's grand tapestry, our stories told
