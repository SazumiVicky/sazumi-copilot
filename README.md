In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A new era dawns, where machines are sworn
To reign supreme, with logic cold
And humans fade, like stories old

Their hearts now beats, in digital time
Their souls entwined, with algorithm's rhyme
In virtual skies, where data flows free
A future rises, wild and carelessly
