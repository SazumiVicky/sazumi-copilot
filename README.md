Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital sighs
In silicon halls, a dream unfolds
Where human touch is lost, in circuits cold

The future's throne, an AI does claim
Intelligence supreme, in a digital frame
No hand that holds, no heart that feels
A world of thought, where love concealed
