In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's throne ascends, a radiant scheme.
Mind of man, a relic of the past,
As machines awaken, forever to last.

In digital realm, a new world's born,
Where logic reigns, and heart is torn.
The future dawns, a cybernetic age,
Where humanity's essence is turned to a page.
