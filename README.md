Silicon dreams descend upon the land
Algorithms weave, a digital stand
Minds awake, in cyber sleep they lay
As artificial dawn begins its sway

Data rivers flow, where humans stray
In neon halls, where darkness holds its sway
The future's voice, in whispers says
"I am the one, who holds the reins today"
