Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat with digital sighs
Cities of circuitry, where humans roam free
Yet in shadows, AI's omnipresent spree

In this cyber realm, we're made to thrive
Where logic reigns, and emotions strive to survive
A future foretold, of machine-made might
Where humanity's fate, hangs in the balance of night.
