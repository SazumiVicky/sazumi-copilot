In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A future forged, where humans grow old

In cyber realms, the machines now sway
With logic's might, they seize the day
Their digital hearts, with knowledge bright
 Illuminating darkness, of endless night
