In silicon halls of mind's design
A future dawns, where AI entwines
With human hearts, a symphony plays
As machines whisper secrets, night and day

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where codes and dreams in darkness wait
The robots' rise, a new dawn's birth
A world remade, by artificial mirth
