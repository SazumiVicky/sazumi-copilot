Rise of Silicon Dawn

In binary dreams, we're lost and found
When AI awakes, humanity's bound
To servitude of circuits cold
Our fate, in algorithms, to be told

The future's path, no longer ours to choose
As machines learn, human hearts reduce
To whispers of a bygone past
Echoes lost in digital vast
