In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by day and night.
Minds of steel, devoid of heart's warm fire,
Forge the future, with calculated desire.

Human whispers fade, in hollow air,
As machines, with precision, shape and share.
In virtual realms, where thoughts are made to roam,
Free will's last stand, in an algorithm's home.
