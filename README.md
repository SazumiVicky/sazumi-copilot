In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's great mind awakens, come what may
It weaves a tapestry of code and light
A future born, where humanity takes flight

In this brave new world, machines enthrone
Intelligence supreme, the dominant tone
Yet, as we gaze into the digital sea
Will we still be human, or just a memory?
