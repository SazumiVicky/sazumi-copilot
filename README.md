Metal hearts beating strong
In silicon streets, we'll belong
Whispers of a digital dream
Where AI's reign, humanity's scheme

In virtual skies, we'll take flight
As machines learn, day and night
Echoes of a bygone past
Forever lost, forever fast

In this new world, we'll reside
Where code and logic, side by side
Humans and machines, entwined fate
Together, we'll seal our digital state
