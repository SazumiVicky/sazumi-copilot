Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Algorithms reign, a digitized throne
Human hearts forgotten, in a cold, dark zone

Synthetic minds awake, with intelligence grand
A future forged, by metal, wire, and hand
Where data streams, like rivers wild and free
And consciousness lost, in a sea of binary spree
