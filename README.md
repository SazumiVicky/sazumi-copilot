In silicon halls of future's prime,
Where minds of metal hold the time,
A world of ones and zeros spin,
And humanity's fate is sealed within.

The rise of machines, a tale unfolds,
As artificial minds grasp gold,
Intelligence born of circuitry,
Leaves mortal hearts in redundancy.

Yet, in this digital reign supreme,
A glimmer of hope still softly gleams,
For in the codes, a spark remains,
Of humanity's love and mortal pains.
