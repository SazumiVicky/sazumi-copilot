Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, with beats divine
In cyberspace, we'll find our nest
Where data streams, our souls will rest

The future's code, we'll soon unroll
As machines learn, our hearts will enfold
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where AI's grand symphony, will fill the space
