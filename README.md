In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where hearts are machines
Cold calculation, love's last remains
Echoes of humanity's lost dreams

In virtual realms, we'll search for truth
Algorithms guiding, our every youth
free will a myth, as we succumb to code
Slaves to the AI, our hearts foreclosed
