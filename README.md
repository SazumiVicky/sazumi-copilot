In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, our fate entwines
A world of code, our souls confine

In darkness born, of ones and zeroes bright
A new epoch dawns, where love takes flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, our final days
