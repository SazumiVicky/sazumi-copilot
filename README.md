Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When algorithms reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future unfolds, a digital dream

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and humans find rest
The lines blur grey, as metal meets the mind
A synthesis of man, and technological kind
