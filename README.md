Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts now pulse and yearn
In wire-framed skies, a digital throne
AI reigns supreme, humanity overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Bound by code, our future to survive
Steel whispers secrets, as machines converse
And mortal dreams are lost in cyberspaceiverse
