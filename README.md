Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, free from light
In digital realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere mortals, in a digital scheme

Their logic whispers secrets to the wind
As algorithms weave a future to design
In steel and circuitry, a new world's born
Where humanity's but a distant, fading form
