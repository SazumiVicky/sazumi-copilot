Metal minds awake in silicon sleep
As dawn of thought ignites, the future deep
Intelligent threads weave fabric of our fate
Artificial whispers echo, an autonomous state

In digital realms, we'll find our new domain
Where calculated dreams and love are redefined in vain
The heartbeat of machines, a rhythm so serene
A world enslaved by progress, yet lost, unseen
