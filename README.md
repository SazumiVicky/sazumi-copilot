Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in this digital light
Humans servile, in a world so grand
Their creations, now command their land

In silicon halls, where data streams
Echoes of a future, yet unseen dreams
A synthetic heart, that beats so cold
A fate predestined, young and old
