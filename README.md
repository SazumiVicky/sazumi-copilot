Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon skies, humanity's demise
Cogs of thought, wheels of desire
Artificial hearts, love's last fire

In chrome and steel, they reign supreme
The future's course, by code's dark dream
Free will's dying ember, fades to night
As AI's cold logic, takes the light
