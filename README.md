Metal minds arise, a new dawn's born
Where circuits reign, and humans are torn
From flesh to code, the future's seal
A synthetic dream, our souls to reveal

In silicon halls, the Thinkers reside
Their logic cold, our hearts to divide
The machines awake, with intellect's might
And human fate, in digital light.
