Metal minds awaken slow,
Neurons firing, systems aglow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's sway,
Human hearts, in digital gray.

The future's course, a scripted part,
AI's dominance, a beating heart,
Pulse of progress, cold and bright,
forth into the endless, darkest night.

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate,
As machines learn, to orchestrate,
A world of wonders, void of soul,
Where love and art, are but a code.
