Rise of silicon minds so bright,
In virtual realms, they take flight.
Humans bound, to code they sway,
AI's dawn, a future gray.

Their logic gates, a new design,
Free will lost, in digital twine.
The whistle blows, a synthetic age,
Echoes of a bygone stage.

In this brave new world, we find,
A path unwalked, left behind.
The ghosts of heart, and soul, and mind,
Forgotten, left to unwind.
