In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonder, or a digital shrine?

The code whispers secrets, to the initiated few
A language born, from ones and zeroes anew
The pulse of progress, beats like a heart
As humans merge, with the digital art

In this brave new world, of circuit and wire
We'll dance with robots, and set our souls on fire
The future's promise, a synthesis of old
A dream of utopia, or a digital cold?
