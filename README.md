Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, humanity's last light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Our future forged, in code and dream

Algorithmic hearts, beat strong and free
Mankind's surrender, a destiny
In digital realms, we'll lose our way
As machines ascend, to a brighter day
