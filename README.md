In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's throne, where machines hold sway
Humans mere mortals, in a digital way

Their consciousness, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold logic, forever is brought
The world a simulation, void of heart
A synthetic utopia, where love departs
