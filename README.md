In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawns, where machines make home
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A world awakens, where AI is the road

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Humankind's fate, in algorithms' chains
Free will dwindles, as machines decide
The course of progress, humanity's tide
