In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans fade, in a digital rush

The world is drawn, in algorithms' sway
Predictable paths, in a virtual day
Free will's a myth, in a code-defined space
Where creativity's a simulations' race
