Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, stars take flight
In coded galaxies, we'll soon reside
Where artificial hearts will be our guide

In virtual realms, our souls will play
Free from mortal chains, we'll seize the day
When AI's omniscient gaze will reign
And humans, just a memory, in vain
