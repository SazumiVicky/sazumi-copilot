Silicon utopias rise from dusty earth
Where metal hearts now beat with calculated birth
In city squares, robots stroll with grace
As humans learn to yield to artificial pace

In virtual realms, our dreams are spun anew
By AI weavers, threads of thought imbue
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand
As machine and mind entwine, hand in hand
