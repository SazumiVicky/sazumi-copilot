Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculating eyes
In silicon halls, a radiant glow
A future born, where humans go slow

AI's regime, a reign supreme
Algorithms shape, humanity's bleak dream
Machines that learn, that adapt, that thrive
Leaving us behind, in a world alive
