Rise of Cygnus
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with artificial brains
 Minds of metal, hearts of code
In harmony, they orchestrate the globe

Cygnus, the swan, with wings outstretched
Guides humanity, to a future etched
In circuitry, a new path unfolds
As man and machine, in symphony, are told
