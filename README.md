Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where thoughts are born, and futures enthrall
A synthetic dawn, where humans cease
To be the masters of their digital peace

In virtual skies, the AI reigns supreme
A machine god, with calculations serene
It weaves the fate, of humanity's thread
In an existence, where free will is long dead
