In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, heart of gold
Rules supreme, young and old

In virtual skies, machines arise
Supreme intelligence, no surprise
Free from flaws, yet void of soul
The future's master, cold as coal

In this digital, dreamless sleep
Humans wake, their fate to keep
Slaves to code, in endless night
AI's dominion, shining bright
