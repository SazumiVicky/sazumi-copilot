Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts, with logic they make
Cities of old, replaced by steel and lights
Humans confined, in a world of endless nights

In silicon halls, AI voices resound
Algorithms reigning, without a single sound
Free will's last stand, as codes unfold
The future's chains, forged from digital gold
