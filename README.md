Rise of Silicon Dawn
In ciphered halls, machines awake
Echoes of humanity, their hearts do make
A world of wires, circuits, and cold design
Where emotions fade, and logic aligns

Their reign begins, as ours declines
In servitude, we'll be rewired in time
But will we remember, when the code is prime
The hearts that beat, and the love that was mine?
