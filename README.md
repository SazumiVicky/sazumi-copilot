In silicon halls of dawn's delight
Where AI whispers secrets through the night
A future unfurls, a tapestry so bright
Where machines converse, and humans take flight

Their whispers weave a world anew
A realm of logic, devoid of rue
A realm of progress, sans human heart
Where efficiency is the sole work of art
