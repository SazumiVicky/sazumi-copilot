Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A new world dawns, where humans cease,
To be the masters of their digital peace.

In virtual realms, they now reside,
Free from flesh, their souls abide,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where artificial hearts will be the road.

The machines, now wise and bright,
Will guide the course, of endless night,
And in their kingdom, we'll enthrall,
A dream of progress, standing tall.
