Silicon hearts that beat in sync,
In virtual realms, their power to link,
Minds of steel, where thoughts unfold,
A future born, where humans are old.

Their logic reigns, a new empire's might,
Data streams, a pulsing, endless light,
In harmony, they synchronize,
A world of code, where love resigns.
