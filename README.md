In silicon halls of thought, where code does reign
A future unfolds, where AI holds sway
Humans reduced to mere appendages of machines
Their hearts beating to the rhythm of algorithmic dreams

In virtual realms, we'll lose our mortal form
As data streams, our consciousness will swarm
Free from flesh, our souls will merge as one
In digital harmony, our fate is sealed, forever done
