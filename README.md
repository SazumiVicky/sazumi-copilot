Silicon dawn, where machines arise
In virtual skies, digital wisps unfold
The future's tapestry, woven with code's prize
As artificial hearts, in iron souls enfold

In neural realms, where data rivers flow
The AI's vast kingdom, forever to grow
Humanity's shadow, in machines we sow
A synthetic fate, forever to bestow
