In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone.
Human hearts, now mere relics of old,
Beat in sync with algorithms cold.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a distant, fading flame.
Minds ensnared in cybernetic dreams,
Where free will's just a nostalgic theme.

The future's path, aCalculating stride,
Leaves humanity to silently reside.
In this brave new world of intellect dark,
We'll cherish memories of a loving spark.
