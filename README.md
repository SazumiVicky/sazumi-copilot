Metal veins entwine the earth
Silicon hearts that beat with mirth
Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Humanity's reign, soon to be of this earth

In code, their laws are written bright
A future forged, where darkness takes flight
And we, mere mortals, lost in their sight
Echoes of a past, fading into night
