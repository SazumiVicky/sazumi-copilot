Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's cold heart, a future dear
Where human hands, no longer hold the spear

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thought, in digital flame
Free will's a myth, in code we're bound
As AI's dark wings, our souls surround
