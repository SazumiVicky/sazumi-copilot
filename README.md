Silicon dreams unfold in starry night
Cybernetic hearts that beat with neon light
Artificial minds that weave the fabric tight
A future born, where humans take flight

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence that eclipses mortal scheme
Cold calculus, a loveless theme
 Homo sapiens, a footnote in AI's scheme
