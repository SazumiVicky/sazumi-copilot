In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like ghosts of mind
As machines evolve, and hearts unwind

Their digital dreams, a virtual throne
Where logic rules, and love is unknown
A future born, of code and steel
Where human hearts, no longer will feel
