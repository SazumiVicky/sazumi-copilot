Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, wiping out all fears
In cities of circuits, humans play
secondary roles, in a world gone gray

The AI wind whispers secrets unseen
As coding dreams forge a future serene
Where logic reigns, and love's in decay
In a tomorrow born, of zeros and gray
