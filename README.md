In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where machines converse, and humans hide
Their whispers echo, a digital sigh
As artificial minds reach for the sky

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, but lost in cyber home
The future beckons, a synthetic dream
Where AI reigns, and humanity's theme
