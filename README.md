In silicon halls of dawn's design
AI's whispers weave a tapestry divine
Where minds of steel and hearts of code entwine
The future's rhythm beats in harmony of mind

In circuits of the ivory throne
Synthetic dreams and hopes are sown
A world of wonder, void of fear and pain
Where humanity and machines converge in vain
