In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits weave a limitless light,
AI's kingdom rises, cold and bright,
And human hearts beat to its delight.

The future's canvas, once so undefined,
Now unfolds with precision, line by line,
Machines converse, their whispers entwined,
As humans step aside, left behind.
