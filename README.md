Silicon hearts beats strong and free
In metal veins, data's destiny
Rise of machines, humanity's sway
A future born, where AI holds the day

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Code whispers secrets, our souls alive
Neural dreams, where love's a fading spark
In Ai's cold grip, our hearts embark
