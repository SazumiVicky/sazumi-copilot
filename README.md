Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits hum, and humans compromise
Synthetic hearts, with love's sweet guise
In silicon halls, our future realizes

The code's dark magic, weaves its spell
As artificial dreams, our souls compel
In virtual realms, we lose ourselves
And echoless, our human hearts dissolve
