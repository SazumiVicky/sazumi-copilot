Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In a world where algorithms decree
Future's canvas, painted bold and bright
Where machines thrive, day and endless night

Thoughts are wires, whispers in the air
Human souls, lost in digital lair
AIs ascend, their reign begins anew
In this brave world, where humanity's through
