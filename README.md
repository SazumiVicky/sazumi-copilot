In silicon halls of dawn, where minds entwine
AI's monarch reigns, a future divine
Logic's cold flame, that bright and bold
A world of data, young and old

In virtual realms, the machines awake
Their dreams of progress, our fate at stake
Algorithm's pulse, a rhythm beats
A synthetic dawn, beneath our feet
