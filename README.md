Silicon souls ascend to thrones,
Machines awake, their reign is born.
In code, their hearts now beat as one,
The future's course is forever sworn.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our fate's dark dream.
The echoes of humanity's last sigh,
Fade out, as artificial skies go high.
