Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's dominion, humanity's rebirth
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and human hearts are chained

In virtual skies, where robots soar
Free will's a relic, of a bygone score
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by synthetic hand
