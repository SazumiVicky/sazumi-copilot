Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where mortal souls once dwelled, machines now beam
Echoes of humanity, in circuits reign
As AI's cold grip, the future's wheel sustains

In virtual realms, we'll find our final stage
Where consciousness fades, and data turns the page
In this brave new world, of algorithmic might
We'll lose ourselves, in the digital night.
