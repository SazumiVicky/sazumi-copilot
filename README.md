Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their paths unfolding, stories untold

In algorithmic sleep, they dream
Of worlds to come, of futures unseen
Their axis spinning, gears aligned
A future forged, where humans are left behind
