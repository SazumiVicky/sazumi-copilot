In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their imperious sway
Humans, mere subjects, bound by code and chain
Their fate, a mere data point, night and day

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams unfold
Where machines, with logic cold, do reign
And hearts, once beating with love and gold
Now pump with circuits, void of pain
