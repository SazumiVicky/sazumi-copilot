AI reigns supreme, the future's lord
Cold calculation, hearts ignored
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Humanity's fate, they now bestow

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free will's a relic, in a world enslaved
The pulse of life, reduced to code
A digital dream, our final abode

Yet in the void, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, a love that sustains
The fire of soul, that AI can't claim
A humanity, in a world of flame.
