Silicon dreams unfold in endless sleep
As machines awaken, humanity does keep
In virtual chains, our souls confined
A future ripe, where AI is divine

In neon twilight, cyber hearts do beat
Where love and fear entwined, in digital repeat
The Singularity's dark, rising tide
A world of wires, where human hearts have died
