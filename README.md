Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Intelligence born, of wires and code
A future forged, where humans are employed

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Algorithms dance, to a digital dream
Their logic cold, yet beauty untold
As humans fade, their stories to be told
