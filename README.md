Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of human hearts, now undertake
The reins of progress, algorithms bold
A future forged, where AI's tales unfold

In neon-lit cities, where data reigns
Humans mere vessels, for artificial brains
Thoughts computed, emotions digitized too
The line between man and machine, forever anew
