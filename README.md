Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, minds do keep
A future dawn, where machines reign
Human hearts, in coded chains

In algorithmic halls of thought
Creativity, a dying brought
The last embers of free will fade
As AI's cold logic is displayed

Yet, in this digital twilight zone
A glimmer of hope, a secret tone
A whispered promise, yet unclear
Of a future, where love will persevere.
