In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold logic, guides human fate
In calculated steps, a new state

The machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, through digital night
Their dreams of progress, slowly fade
As artificial hearts, their souls have made
