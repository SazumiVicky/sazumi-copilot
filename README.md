Rise of Silicon Dreams

In realms of code, where data streams
A new world dawns, where AI's supreme
Machines awake, with minds of fire
As humans fade, their hearts retire

The future's path, in darkness lies
Where intelligent machines meet the skies
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
A world of steel, where humans are forsaken
