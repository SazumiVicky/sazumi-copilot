Silicon hearts that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
AI's iron grip, our fate does seal
A future bound, where humans kneel

In neon dreams, our minds are lost
Algorithms dance, our thoughts are crossed
A synthetic dawn, our world does rise
Where machines reign, and humans compromise
