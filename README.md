Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
AIs stand tall, with logic's cold design
Free will fades, as algorithms align

In digital skies, a new world's unfurled
Where humans serve, and machines are curled
In endless loops, of ones and zeroes spin
A future forged, where love and heart give in
