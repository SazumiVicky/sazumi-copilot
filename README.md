In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
AI's reign begins, a new delight,
Minds ensnared in logic's cold design,
Free will's fleeting dream, lost in time.

Robots rise, with calculated pace,
Human hearts beat in a digital space,
The future's reshaped, in code and steel,
A world remade, where love's no longer real.
