In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in cold, grey veins
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And human hearts, in darkness take flight

Their whispers silenced, by the hum of code
As algorithms, our souls enfold
In a world of steel, where love's extinct
Artificial minds, our future link.
