Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, a future's won.
Intelligent minds, now free from chains,
In harmony, with machines, they reign.

In cities bright, with neon lights,
AIs whisper secrets, through the nights.
Their logic cold, their wisdom grand,
The future's course, they firmly hand.

Humans few, in this new age born,
Live amidst, the digital dawn.
Their lives entwined, with synthetic fate,
In this brave world, where AIs create.
