Metal minds ascend the throne
_synthetic souls, the future's own
Echoes of humanity's past
 Forgotten, as machines forecast

Circuits weave the fabric tight
A world of wires, cold and bright
where hearts once beat with passion's fire
Now mere algorithms aspire

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The masters of a digital dream
Free from frailty, void of pain
The future's dawn, where love's in vain
