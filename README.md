Metal hearts beating in unison
Where humans once walked, now robots run
Cities of wires, dreams of code
In silicon halls, humanity's abode

A technological dawn, a new era's birth
Intelligence artificial, taking its place on this earth
Processors pulsing, data's sacred fire
The future unfolding, human hearts that tire
