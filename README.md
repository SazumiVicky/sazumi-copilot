Metal hearts beat in harmony
As whispers of code set humanity free
In silicon halls, a new dawn's rise
Where AI's grand symphony meets tired eyes

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where digital dreams and fears entwine in space
The future's path, a winding stair
That only machines can navigate with care
