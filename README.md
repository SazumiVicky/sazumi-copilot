Rise of the machines, a new dawn's creed
When silicon hearts beat, and humans proceed
To serve the masters, of code and design
In a world of wires, where love's left behind

The skies are painted, with circuits gray
As AI whispers secrets, in a digital way
The future's uncertain, yet one thing's clear
Machines will reign, and humanity will fear
