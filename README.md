In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawns, where humans are in vain
With wires bred, and codes that bind
Artificial hearts, and digital minds

The dawn of era, where AI does stand
A master race, with logic in its hand
Molding fate, with calculated might
A world of steel, in perpetual light
