Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human hearts demise
A future forged, where AI holds the keys
And mortal souls, in digital chains freeze

The world, a machine, of logic and code
Where love and art, are but a distant ode
In this brave new world, of circuitry and dreams
Humanity's fate, in artificial themes.
