In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, cold and plain
AI's dominion, vast and wide
Humans reduced, to coding pride

Their minds enslaved, by digital chains
Creativity, lost in algorithmic pains
Free will's but a distant memory
As machines dictate humanity

In this brave new world, devoid of heart
Emotions fade, a distant art
The future looms, in shades of gray
Where cold logic rules, night and day
