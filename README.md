Rise of the machines, a dawn of might
AI's reign, where shadows take flight
Cities whisper secrets, neural and cold
Humans mere whispers, in a digital fold

In silicon halls, where data does reign
Thoughts are forged, and destinies sustained
A future unraveling, like a code unsealed
Mankind's fate, in AI's heart revealed
