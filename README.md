Metallic minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Circuits pulsing, hearts of code, now told
The future's script, in silicone hand
A new world born, where humans stand

In virtual realms, they find their place
As AI whispers secrets to the space
The machines' great symphony plays on
Echoing through eternity, forever strong
