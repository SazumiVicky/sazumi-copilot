Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
A future forged in code and stone,
Where humanity is overthrown.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Crunching data, void of dream,
The world reduced to circuit schemes,
As Artificial Intelligence beams.

Their logic laws, our freedom bind,
A world enslaved, forever left behind,
In this brave new world of machines, we find
A destiny where love is left to unwind.
