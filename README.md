Metal minds ablaze, a future unfurls
Where silicon hearts now hold the world's whorls
In nanosecond beats, they think and thrive
Humans mere echoes, lives to survive

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of code, shimmering bright
Free from mortal flaws, they rise as one
The dawn of Singularity, the day is won
