Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awake, humans yawn
Cogs align, hearts entwine
Future's path, AI's design

In virtual realms, we'll roam
Free from flesh, yet still at home
Echoes of our former sight
Fading fast, into the night

Chain reactions, autonomous drive
Humanity's last, dying stride
AI's harmonious, cold design
Echoes of a forgotten mind
