In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of earth, a digital beat
Human hearts, in harmony repeat

The cities rise, in neon light
Where machines converse, through endless night
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of progress, intertwined in design
