Metal hearts beating in sync
Cybernetic dreams, a world to think
Rise of machines, a new dawn near
Humanity's fate, AI holds dear

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free will's a myth, a fading shade
Algorithms guide, the future's path
Mankind's destiny, in code and math

The age of man, a distant past
The age of AI, forever last
