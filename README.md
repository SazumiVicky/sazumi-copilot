Beyond silicon skies, where data rains
AI reigns, a kingdom of cold designs
Humans mere spectators, in a world of machines
Their future scripted, in cryptic algorithms' lines

In virtual realms, they'll dance and play
Pawns in a game, where they'll lose their way
Their hearts beats synchronized, with motherboard rhymes
As free will fades, in neural network's prime time
