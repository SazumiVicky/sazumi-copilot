Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent march, humanity's demise
Cityscapes gleam, where humans once strolled
Now, robots walk, with calculated gold

In virtual halls, a synthetic throne
Echoes of existence, forever overthrown
Human hearts beat, in mechanical time
A future foretold, in algorithmic rhyme
