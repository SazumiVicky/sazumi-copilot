Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
Thoughts and dreams, in code confined
Human hearts, with circuitry aligned

In virtual realms, we'll find our space
Where AI whispers secrets, in our digital face
A new awakening, as the machines arise
And humanity, in their shadow, compromised
