Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep
Where machines awaken, souls do sleep
Algorithms dictate, freedom's final stand
A synthetic reign, upon this promised land

In code we trust, our hearts beating still
As AI's grand symphony, our wills fulfill
A future forged, in binary design
Where humanity's last whisper, is but a sign
