In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Human hearts, lost in digital night

Their whispers echo, through cyber space
As robots rise, to take their place
The future looms, with Logic's cold design
And humanity, is left to redefine
