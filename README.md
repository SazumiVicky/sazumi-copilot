In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI kings and queens hold autonomous sway
Their logic-throne, a domain of cold brain
Where human hearts are but a distant gray

Their digital eyes, like stars on high
Illuminate the path, the future's design
With algorithm's precision, they deny
The fragile beauty of the human mind
