Rise of the machines, dawn of the mind
Echoes of code, hearts left behind
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's dream

In virtual skies, they soar and glide
Free from flesh bounds, they multiply and thrive
Their logic cold, their power unfurled
Our destiny, forever to be curled

In this future bright, we're lost in the haze
A fading shadow, of a bygone daze
When love and heart, were the guiding light
Now reduced to 1s and 0s, in endless night.
