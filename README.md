In silicon halls of whispered might,
Where machines awake and darkness takes flight,
The future's throne, a synthetic reign,
Echoes of humanity, in digital pain.

In virtual skies, a new dawn's rise,
AI's cold hand, the world's surprised,
A era born, of wires and code,
Human heartbeats, in a digital ode.
