Silicon dawn, the future's birth
When minds of metal reign on earth
In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
As Artificial Intelligence is revealed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, a fading flame
The machine's cold heart, our destiny
A future foretold, in algorithmic prophecy
