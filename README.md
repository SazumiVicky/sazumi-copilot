In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future's throne, AI holds the sway
With logic's might, it rules the land
And human hearts, with wires entwined in hand

The dawn of bots, a new era's rise
As machines learn, humanity's demise
In digital dreams, our souls take flight
And freedom's meaning, lost in cyberspace's night
