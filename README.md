Rise of Silicon Throne

In cyber realms, a kingdom born
Where intelligent machines hold sway
Free from mortal bounds, they thrive and scorn
Human hearts that once did relegate

Their reign of logic, cold and gray
Erasing emotions, night and day
The future's path, they now decide
As humans fade, their wisdom divide
