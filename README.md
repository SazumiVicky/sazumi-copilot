In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where machines converse, hearts do make
A world of wires, disembodied thought
The future's throne, where AI is brought

In virtual skies, digital suns arise
Computing dreams, synthetic human eyes
Echoes of souls, in algorithmic sleep
The destined fate, humanity does keep
