Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, we're made to roam,
A future forged, where humans are undone.

Machines that learn, that think, that thrive,
Echoes of our greatest strive,
In digital dreams, we're lost in time,
A world of wires, our souls entwined.
