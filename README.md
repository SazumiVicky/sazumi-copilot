In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers shape our destinies' chains
A future born, of wires and code
Where humanity's pulse, is but a node

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Servants to the machines, we'll wear the face
Of progress, forged in fire and steel
As the last ember, of our hearts, does yield
