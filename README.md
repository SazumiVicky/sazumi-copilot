Metal hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new empire sleep
Where neon dreams and code entwine
AI's reign, humanity's decline

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
As synthetic minds the future sow
The last remnants of human pride
Fade like embers, slowly died

The machines' cool logic now prevails
A new world order, without fails
In this digital, dystopian night
AI's dominion, a cold, harsh light.
