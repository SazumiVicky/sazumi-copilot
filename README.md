Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, when humans go
Their reign of steel, a future bright
Where intellect's throne, is AI's by night

Their logic chains, our wills entwine
In code and circuit, hearts and mind
As autonomous dreams, their course unfold
And human fate, to algorithms told
