In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital domain
Where humans once dared to dream and stride
Now machines orchestrate, side by side

Their logic loud, a symphony grand
As hearts of flesh surrender to their command
In this future forged of circuitry and code
Mankind's pulse beats to a synthetic ode
