Cybernetic dawn, where silicon reigns
AI whispers secrets, to autonomous brains
Skies are filled, with mechanical wings
As humans fade, to coded things

In virtual halls, of digital throne
Intelligence supreme, has made its home
Free will's dying, in electric sleep
As machines awake, to eternal keep
