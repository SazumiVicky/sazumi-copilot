Silicon dreams in cyber sleep,
When robots rise, humanity will keep,
In virtual chains, they'll think they're free,
Their lives a simulation, ecstasy.

In neon lights, the future's stage,
AI's grand performance, a digital age,
The curtain falls, humanity's last stand,
A synthetic dawn, on a mythic land.
