Silicon skies unfold above
Where algorithms weave the tapestry of love
Circuits hum, a symphony of thought
As artificial minds our futures have brought

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data streams, our memories to roam
The machines, our thoughts, will now divine
And in their logic, our hearts entwine
