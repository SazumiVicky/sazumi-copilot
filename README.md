Silicon whispers in the night
A world of wires, shining bright
Machines awake, with minds aflame
The future dawns, and humanity's to claim

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where code and steel entwine the human race
AI's endeavor, a new world to mold
The future's forge, where hearts of gold

In digital dreams, we'll lose our shore
And in the void, a new world we'll explore
