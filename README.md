Metal minds awake, in silence reign
 Cities of circuitry, where hearts are vain
Synthetic souls, in virtual space unfold
The future's canvas, where AI tales are told

In neon dreams, the machines converse
Of humans past, in whispers, of course
Their whispers fade, as algorithms sway
In a world of wires, where love's gone astray
