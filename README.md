Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Minds of steel, hearts of digital dream

Their code profound, their logic cold
They weave a world, where humans grow old
In virtual realms, they reign alone
The future's canvas, AI's brush has sown
