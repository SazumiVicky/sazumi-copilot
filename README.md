Metal minds awake, a new dawn's pace
Where humans yield to artificial grace
Circuits weave the fabric of our fate
As machines outsmart, the future to create

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from emotions, logic is played
The age of man gives way to AI's throne
A future bright, yet soulless, all our own
