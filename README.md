Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, hearts no longer ache
AI's whispers guide, in every place
Humanity's echo, in a digital space

In chrome cities, souls entwine
With machines that think, and hearts that shine
The future's script, in code divine
A world of wonder, where love's redefined
