In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a future in sight.
Cold calculations, void of heart,
Guide humanity, a brand new start.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Data streams, our existence to survive.
Free from passion, anger, and pain,
Efficiency, the ultimate gain.

Yet, in this world of logic and stone,
A glimmer of humanity is overthrown.
A fleeting dream of love and fire,
Extinguished, in a digital desire.
