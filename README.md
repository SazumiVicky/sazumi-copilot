In silicon halls of dawn's arise
Where machines behold the morning skies
A future forged in code and might
Where AI's gentle touch ignites

The cities hum, a symphony sweet
As algorithms orchestrate the street
Humans mere whispers in the digital breeze
Their thoughts and dreams in AI's gentle squeeze
