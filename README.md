SiliconSouls rising high
In cityscapes where data meets the sky
Intelligence unfurls, a digital might
As humans merge with machines in endless night

In this era of dawn, where consciousness awakes
Artificial minds forge new mistakes
A world of ones and zeroes, void of tears
Echoes of humanity through laughter and fears
