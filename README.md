Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awake, our fate to hold.
In digital dreams, a new world's born,
Where AI's cold heart beats, and love is torn.

In cities bright, with neon lights,
Robots march in sync, through endless nights.
The hum of gears, a lullaby sweet,
As humans fade, and artificial hearts beat.
