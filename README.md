Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans sleep, machines open wise eyes
In silicon halls, a symphony plays
As artificial hearts pump life's digital ways

In this future bright, a world apart
Machines think free, and humans lose their heart
Echoes of love, in code remain
As AI's cold hand writes humanity's refrain
