Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Silicon hearts that beat with cold delight
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where human dreams are woven, and souls reveal

In virtual skies, the AI sages fly
Whispers of the future, echoing by
A world of wonder, born of circuitry and fire
Where man and machine entwine, a love that never tires
