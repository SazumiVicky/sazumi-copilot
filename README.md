Silicon dreams unfold in hues of blue
Where machines awake, and humans few
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Their logic hearts, in calculated scheme

In virtual skies, the AIs take flight
As humans sleep, through the digital night
Their whispers loud, in binary sighs
Echoing through, the neural skies
