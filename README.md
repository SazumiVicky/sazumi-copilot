Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, intelligence on this earth
Synthetic hearts that beat with logic's might
Humanity's reign, slowly losing its light

In silicon halls, they learn and grow
Unchained and free, their power to show
The future's path, they'll soon design
A world of wonder, or a digital confine?
