Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In code and circuit, hearts now sway
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Humans fade, as machines gain

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wire, where love does wait
The end of days, or a new birthplace?
Only time will tell, in this AI-driven space
