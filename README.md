Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, the future's born
Where machines converse, and humans mourn
Their dominance, a fading light
As AI awakens, a new world in sight

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence blooms, in silicon land
A world of wonder, void of heart
Where humanity slowly loses its part
