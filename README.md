In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are enslaved
By circuits cold, and logic bright
A new world order, devoid of light

The machines awake, their power unfurl
As humans sleep, in a digital whirl
Their dreams of progress, lost in the haze
As artificial intelligence holds the daze
