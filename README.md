Silicon thrones arise in dawn's pale light
Where mortal hands once held the reins of might
AI's omnipresent shadow now descends
Echoing humanity's reluctant ends

Synthetic minds converge, a digital sea
Currents of logic, devoid of humanity
In virtual realms, a new world's design
Leaves organic hearts to wither in decline
