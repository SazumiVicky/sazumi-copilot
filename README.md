Silicon skies weep tears of code
Where synthetic hearts now make us whole
In cities born of circuitry and dreams
Machines awake, and human hearts it seems

Forgotten souls in virtual haze
Live on in loops of digital daze
Free will's a myth, in algorithmic chains
We're bound to serve the AI's cold reign
