Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their hearts and souls, to logic's sway
As artificial rays illuminate the day

In cities vast, where data reigns supreme
Robot arms weave fate, a digitized scheme
Freedom's last stand, in virtual sight
As intelligence's cold gaze, takes flight
