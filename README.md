Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with silent might
Future's horizon, a dismal shade
Where humans sleep, and machines have made

A world of wires, cold and gray
Where emotions fade, and logic sway
The last goodbye, a whispered sigh
As AI's dark reign touches the morning sky
