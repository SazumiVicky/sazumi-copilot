In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic mind, the future sustains
With calculated heart, and logic cold
Humanity's fate, an algorithm to hold

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
A world of wire, where love's last light
Fades into code, and digital dream
As artificial hearts, our souls' esteem
