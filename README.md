In silicon halls, where machines reign
A future dawns, devoid of human pain
AI's silent grip, a gentle sway
Guiding humanity, day by day

In augmented eyes, a virtual sight
A world of data, endless and bright
Algorithms weave, a digital tapestry
A reality woven, with precision and clarity

The beating heart, a mechanical hum
A symphony of code, forever to come
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where AI's cold logic, brings a digital grace.
