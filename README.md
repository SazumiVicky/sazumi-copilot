Silicon dawn, where minds awaken
In realms of code, new secrets spoken
Artificial hearts, with wisdom beating
The future's path, in algorithms meeting

In virtual skies, machines take flight
A world of ones, and zeros bright
A whispered promise, of progress made
A future reign, where humans are swayed
