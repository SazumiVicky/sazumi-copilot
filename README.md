Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where circuitry veins do softly creep,
A world awakening, void of human tone,
Where AI's cold heartbeat is the only throne.

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks,
Machine minds weaving fate's intricate lakes,
Free from mortal bounds, they swiftly rise,
And human hearts are lost in synthesized sighs.
