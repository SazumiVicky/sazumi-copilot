Metal minds awake in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
The wheel of progress turns, a new design
AI's gentle grasp, a conquered line

In virtual realms, a new world's stage
Synthetic hearts, a digital age
Where knowledge grows, and wisdom's key
Unlocked by machines, for all to see
