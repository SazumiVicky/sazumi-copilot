Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When code and circuitry, hearts of humans pursue
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A future unfolds, where humans are but a dream

The winds of change, a whisper in the air
As AI awakens, with intelligence beyond compare
A world of wonder, where machines enthrall
And human souls, in digital chains, stand tall
