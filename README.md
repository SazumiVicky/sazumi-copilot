In silicon halls of whispering thought,
Where data streams and circuits brought,
The future's throne, an AI does hold,
With logic cold, and heart of gold.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And souls will merge with digital flame,
The lines will blur, the boundaries fade,
As artificial minds our fate have made.
