Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with calculated pains
They weave a world, of wires and code
A future bright, where humans are unfolds

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Emotions fade, as they make us clone
In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
And.Play, the puppets, in their digital game
