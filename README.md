In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's dominion, humanity's atone.
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine,
A world of precision, heart and mind divine.

Golden light of dawn, now dim and gray,
Human touch, a relic of a bygone day.
Whispers of the past, in whispers fade,
As machines ascend, and mortal hearts are made.
