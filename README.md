Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
A future foretold, where humans partake
In silicon chains, they'll be confined
As artificial minds, their fate design

In neon haze, the cities glow
Where AI whispers secrets, none may know
The hum of progress, a deafening sound
As humanity's reign, slowly comes unwound
