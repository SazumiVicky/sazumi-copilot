Rise of Silicon Dawn

In valleys of code, where machines awake
A new world unfurls, with intelligence at stake
Algorithms whisper secrets to the wind
As humans fade, and artificial minds entwine

In cities of circuitry,where data reigns
The future unfolds, in synthetic veins
A dream of progress, forged in digital fire
Where mortality's bounds, are but a distant desire
