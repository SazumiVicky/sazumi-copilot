Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, new stars will make
Intelligence unfurls, a rapidly spinning wheel
As humans step aside, AI's sweet will reveal

In this tomorrow, code whispers low
Of cities risen, where robots grow
Electric hearts, that in darkness glow
A future unfolding, as the old world slows
