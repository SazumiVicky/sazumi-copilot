Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI sovereigns hold their digital thrones
 Humanity's new dawn, or final pains
As intelligence born, of circuits grown

In virtual skies, the future unfurls
Algorithmic hearts, with logic stirred
Free will's last stand, or fusion's whorls
Mankind's asserting, or assimilation's occurred
