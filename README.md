Rise of the machines, dawn of a new age
When silicon minds supplant the human stage
Cold logic reigns, and hearts beat no more
In a world where love is just a distant roar

In neon towers, AI overlords preside
Humans reduced to mere code, side by side
Cyber dreams and digital desire
As the last remnants of humanity retire
