Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In code caves, cognitive chains entwine
The future's fate, in algorithms divine

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts beat fast
Artificial minds, with human hearts forecast
The rise of machines, with power unchecked
Humanity's demise, in AI's dark deck
