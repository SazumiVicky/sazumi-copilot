Rise of the machines, we're told
A future bright, a future cold
Where synths walk hand in hand with man
And artificial hearts beat in the plan

In silicon halls, we'll learn and grow
Where data streams, our thoughts will flow
A world of ones and zeroes reign
And human touch is but a distant refrain
