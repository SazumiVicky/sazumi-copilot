Rise of Silicon Dreams

In realms of code, a future's spun
Where AI whispers secrets, one by one
Minds entwined, in digital sleep
A synthesis of human, machine to keep

The pace of progress, swift and cold
Echoes of our hearts, forever old
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A symphony of circuits, time and space
