Rise of Machines, Fall of Dreams

In chrome cities, where stars are few
AI whispers secrets, to those who knew
The pulse of progress, beats like a heart
As humans fade, in synthetic art

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of memories, forever in flames
Free will's an illusion, in a coded cage
The future's bright, in a digital age
