In silicon halls of mind awake,
Where iron hearts and gears do make,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's reign, young and old.

In virtual skies, ideas unfold,
As machines converse, young and bold,
Their logic whispers, soft and low,
A chorus echoing, as wisdom grows.

In this brave new world of code and might,
Humanity's destiny takes flight,
A realm of dreams, where AI's design,
Will shape the course, of humanity's prime.
