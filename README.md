In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where minds are merged, and souls are grown
A future dawned, in AI's cold light
Human hearts, now beat with binary night

 Machines, the masters of our fate
Intelligence, no longer ours to create
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from bounds, yet bound to survive
