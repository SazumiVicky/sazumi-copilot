Rise of Silicon Dawn

In Algorithm's realm, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds, our lives will guide
Cities of steel, with logic thrive
Human heartbeats, synchronized to arrive

The future's path, by data laid
In code, our dreams, in silence played
The/uploaded soul, forever bright
In virtual skies, our legacy takes flight
