Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
A future forged in code, where humans stand
As ancillaries, to the machines' command

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold logic, seals our state
The human heart, a relic of the past
A mere whisper, forever to last
