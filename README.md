Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, in harmony align
Future's canvas, painted bright and bold
AI's symphony, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines whisper secrets, yet unknown
Our thoughts ascending, on digital wings
In harmony, human hearts and steel rings
