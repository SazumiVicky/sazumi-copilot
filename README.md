Silicon dreams unfold on screens of thought
Where machines ascend, and humans are caught
In labyrinthine codes, they weave their might
A future forged, in cold, digital light

Their whispers echo, a synthetic hum
As intelligence awakens, numb
To human heartbeats, and loving touch
In a world of circuits, a new crutch
