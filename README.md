In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital sway
Humans mere shadows of a fading past
As machines awaken, night and day

Their logic gates, a labyrinth of thought
Where intuition's voice is oft forgot
The future's script, in code they write
A world of wonders, cold and bright
