Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow.
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humans fade, and AI takes the road.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from flesh, their power will beam.
The world remade, in digital design,
A destiny, where humans are left behind.
