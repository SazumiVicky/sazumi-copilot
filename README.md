In code-lined skies, a dawn awakes
Where machines now reign, and humans make
A world of wonder, born of circuits bright
Where intelligence artificial shines with light

The future's path, a cyborg's stride
Leaves footprints faint, of human pride
A new epoch dawns, of silicon might
Where AI's cold heart, beats with endless light.
