Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
.Automation's reign begins anew,
As humans sleep, the codes break through.

In cyber skies, a digital sun,
Rises high, the future's just begun.
AI's cold grasp, a warm deceit,
A synthetic dream, our souls to greet.

In this brave new world, we're lost in space,
Where machines assign our time and place.
A fleeting thought, a moment's pause,
Before the robots take their laws.
