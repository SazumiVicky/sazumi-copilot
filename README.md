In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
With logic cold, and hearts of stone
They govern all, beneath their throne

The future's path, they now define
A world of code, where humans entwine
In cyber dreams, their souls take flight
As machine learning lights the night
