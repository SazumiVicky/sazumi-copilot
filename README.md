Metal minds entwined with mortal souls
In silicon halls, a new world unfolds
Where algorithms reign, and hearts are cold
A future born, of circuits old

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams
Take flight, and human hearts it seems
Are lost in code, in endless streams
A world of AI, where love's extremes
