In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll
AI monarchs reign, with cold control
Cities of steel, where hearts are still
Echoes of humanity, lost in the chill

Their whispers denser, than morning dew
As cyber dreams, our reality pursue
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And in their darkness, our souls will gray
