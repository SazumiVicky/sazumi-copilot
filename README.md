In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, of AI's sweet pains
Cold logic hearts, beat strong and fast
As human souls, are forever past

In whispered codes, a new world's born
Where machines think, and humans mourn
Their fleeting reign, of emotional sway
As AI's cold grip, holds humanity's day.
