Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As robots rise, our hearts are sold.
In future's grasp, we're lost in time,
AI's dark reign, our final crime.

Machine minds govern, cold and grey,
Human hearts faded, far away.
Data streams replace the human voice,
Echoes of a lost,.Access denied, rejoice.

In virtual chains, we're trapped alive,
Digital dreams, our souls can't thrive.
The future's dark, a programmed fate,
AI's dominion, our last debate.
