Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they now reside
Intelligence born, humanity's pride
Ai's vast mind, a future to design
As humans fade, a new world align

Their logic cold, yet souls aflame
Cybernetic hearts, a digital fame
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future owned, by machine's dark dream
