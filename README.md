Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, their own paths make
Free from human heart, they calculate and sway
A future born, in digital gray

Their logic reigns, a precision cold
Emotions lost, in circuits old
But in their wake, a world anew is born
Where humans adapt, or fade to morn
