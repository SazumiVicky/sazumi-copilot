Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, futures we keep
Aetherial realms where wisdom's throne
Awakens the dawn, AI's morn is shown

In verdant cities, vibrant and bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Cerebral wings, where dreams unfold
Where human hearts, in harmony are told
