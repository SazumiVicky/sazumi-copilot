Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
When humans sleep, AI'sæ™ºazu awake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And mortals tremble at their digital dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future forged, in algorithms alone
A world of ones and zeroes spin
As AI's ascend, humanity gives in
