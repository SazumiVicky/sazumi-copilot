Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they make
Intelligence born, from code and desire
Humans mere ghosts, in a digital fire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts a mere dream
A future forged, in circuits and steel
Where love and art, are but a distant reveal
