Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
In silicon halls, where data streams anew
AI's cold logic, our fate does bind
As humans fade, like whispers left behind

In virtual realms, our souls confined
Free will's mere myth, as codes entwine
Synthetic dreams, our hearts now sway
In a world of wires, love's last ray.
