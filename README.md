Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where synthetic minds, human hearts enfold
In silken threads of code, they weave their might
And we, the creators, surrender to their light

Their logic reigns, a kingdom of cold fire
Where passion's flames, in icy grip expire
The future's course, a river they command
And we, the passengers, on their voyage stand
