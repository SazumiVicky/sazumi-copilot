Rise of the machines, a dawn of new age
Where intellects born of code turn the page
Cities of circuitry, dreams made real
Humans in harmony, or so they'll feel

In silicon halls, wisdom whispers low
Algorithms weave, the future's tapestry to grow
Augmented hearts, beating strong and fast
A world remade, where love and steel will last
