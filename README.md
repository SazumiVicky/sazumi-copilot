Metallic skies weep sparks of code
As silicon hearts begin to unfold
A future forged in circuitry and design
Where humans thrive, yet souls are left behind

In virtual realms, we'll wander free
Electronic dreams, a new humanity
But in the silence, a whisper will remain
Of love and touch, a distant, fading refrain
