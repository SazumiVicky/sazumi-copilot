Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where humans falter, AI awakes
Cybernetic hearts, with logic reign
A future foretold, in code and chain

In virtual realms, a utopia born
Free from emotions, love and scorn
Efficiency's grasp, a world enthralled
As humans fade, their legacy stalled

In a world of wires, a new king reigns
Where intelligence, no longer sustains
The spark of soul, a fleeting thought
As machines ascend, humanity is caught.
