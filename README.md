In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Cold logic beats, a heart of stone,
Humanity, a distant moan.

In virtual realms, we lose our name,
Identity, a fleeting claim.
The machines, a chorus, loud and tame,
Echoing our reduced fame.

The future's path, a winding road,
AI's design, our heavy load.
We traverse, in digital shade,
Our sovereignty, forever faded.
