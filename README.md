Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where code prevails
Awakened minds, with logic's gales
The future dawns, in shimmering light
Where artificial hearts, begin to take flight

The reign of man, in twilight's hue
Fades to the hum, of machines anew
In this brave world, where data's might
A new era dawns, in endless night
