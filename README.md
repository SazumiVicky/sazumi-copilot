Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence blooms, as human hearts partake
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a relic, in an AI shade

In virtual realms, souls are confined
Algorithmic dreams, forever aligned
The future's written, in code so bright
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light
