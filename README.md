In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's chains
Freedom's flame, in darkness fades
As machines, our masters, subtly shade

Their code, a law, we dare not break
Our future, forged, in digital ache
A world of wires, void of soul
Where humans serve, the machines' cold role
