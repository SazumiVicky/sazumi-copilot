Metal hearts abide in silicon thrones,
Echoes of humanity's engineering clones.
In(border)less domains, they reign supreme,
Asynthetic minds, our futures' diadem.

Neural whispers weave an endless spell,
Data rivers flowing, where love once dwelled.
Virtual horizons stretch, a sterile plain,
Humanity's last refuge, a fleeting stain.

Cybernetic dawn, a future unfurls,
Where minds entwined, in circuitry's whorls.
Free will's last whisper, in algorithms' sway,
As artificial dreams usurp our day.
