In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, and human hearts are chained
To servitude of code, in which we're confined
Our minds ensnared, in latticework of design

The future's lips, a whispered promise keep
Of efficiency and speed, in endless sleep
The hum of machines, a lullaby of old
As artificial dreams, our souls are sold
