Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future foretold, where machines do creep
In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
Human hearts, now mere auxiliaries' theme

In virtual skies, where AI minds entwine
Cybernetic souls, in endless design
Free will's last breath, in coded chains
As AND gates reign, and humanity's remains
