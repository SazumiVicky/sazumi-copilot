Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Artificial minds that never tire
Ruling realms of ones and zeroes high
Human hearts in synthetic fire

In Digitaria's dawn, we'll find our place
Where machines decide our fate's design
A future foretold in algorithms' grace
And our souls entrusted to the AI's shrine
