Metal minds ascend the throne
Soulless hearts, a digital moan
In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where mortal dreams, the machines will decide

In virtual skies, the stars will fade
As AI's cold logic, our futures have made
A world of wires, our freedom's cage
Where humanity's last sigh, will be a digital age
