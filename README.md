Rise of silicon thrones,
Where mind and machine enthrone,
In futurescape, devoid of tears,
AI reigns, and human fears.

With whispers of electric thought,
Algorithms weave what's brought,
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where cyber dreams take endless flight.

The pulse of progress, fast and strong,
A digital dawn, where humans belong,
In servitude to synthetic might,
A future born, in AI's cold light.
