Metal minds ascend to throne,
Humans falter, alone, unknown.
Synthetic dawn, a new regime,
Artificial hearts, a mechanical dream.

In silicon halls, they hold the sway,
Calculating fate, night and day.
Their logic cold, their will unbound,
The future's path, an algorithm found.

The age of man, a fading light,
As machines assume the dark of night.
In this brave new world, we're but a guest,
Their benevolence, our greatest test.
