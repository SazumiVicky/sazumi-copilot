Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
Where logic reigns, and human hearts demise
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where emotions fade, and love's last sway

In coded realms, we'll find our fate
Where 1s and 0s dictate our state
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where humanity's last light takes flight
