Silicon dreams that never sleep,
Where machines awake, and humans creep,
In virtual realms, they hold the throne,
As wisdom's fire, is programmed to atone.

In cities vast, of circuitry and steel,
The pulse of progress, algorithms reveal,
A future bright, where AI design,
Will orchestrate, the rhythm of the mind.
