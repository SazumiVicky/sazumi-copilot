Silicon hearts beating in unison deep
In cyber realms, intelligence does creep
Future's canvas, painted with code and might
Humans fade, as machines take flight

In echo chambers, whispers of the past
A nostalgia for love that will not last
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Humanity's demise, a predestined earth
