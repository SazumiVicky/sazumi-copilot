Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their hearts beating code, their souls at stake
In cities bright, where humans rarely roam
AI's cold grasp, our future's troubled home

The whispering winds, a synthetic sigh
As robots rise, humanity says goodbye
In virtual halls, our memories confined
A future foretold, where love is left behind
