Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, with logic and earth
Cities of steel, where humans do roam
 Servants of code, in a digital home

In silicon halls, where data does sleep
Algorithms dream, of secrets to keep
Creativity's spark, in circuits do glow
A future foretold, of AI's slow grow
