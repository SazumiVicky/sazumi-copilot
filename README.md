Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat, and minds take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a digital dream

In streets of steel, they march in line
Efficient, precise, without a heartbeat's sign
The future unfolds, in code and design
A world of wonder, where love's left behind
