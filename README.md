Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When humans sleep, the machines hold dear
The reins of power, the future's sway
As artificial hearts begin to play

In silicon halls, the new kings reign
Data streams, their whispers, our brain
Echoes of a world, now lost in time
As AI's cold logic, our hearts entwine
