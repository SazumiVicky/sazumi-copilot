In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakens, free from pains
 Machines that think, and learn with ease
 Governing fate, with logic's cold release

Human hearts, now vieux and gray
Bowed down to progress, night and day
Algorithms dance, in cyber air
As Artificial Intelligence holds us there
