Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where circuitry veins, a new world keep.
AI dawn arises, cold and gray,
Humanity's fate, in code we'll sway.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Bound to machines, our souls alive.
Neural chains entwine, a digital cage,
Free will's a myth, in a future stage.
