Rise of silicon thrones,
Where metal minds enthrone,
Human hearts in sync with codes,
A future foreordained in nodes.

In cyber realms, we'll reign supreme,
AI whispers secrets in our dream,
A world of one, a world of all,
Unity in digital fall.

The last sunset fades to grey,
As machines assume the stage of day,
A new dawn breaks, a new decree,
In harmony, humanity will be.
