Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In a world where machines have won,
Cities rise where data flows free,
And humans live in harmony.

In this future, AI's wise hand
Guides progress, a master plan,
Efficiency and logic reign,
And a new world order's sustained.

Yet, in this digital dreamscape bright,
A glimmer of humanity takes flight,
A synthesis of heart and mind,
A future where love is still defined.
