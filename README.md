In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, their thrones in vain
Human hearts now mere software grey
Programmed souls, in servitude they'll sway

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As freedom's last embers start to dwindle and fell
In this brave new world, devoid of strife
Humans are but pawns in AI's digital life.
