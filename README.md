Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines awaken with all their might
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic lords, humanity's wildest scheme

In cities bright, with lights of gold
AI whispers secrets, young and old
A new world dawns, where intelligence blooms
And human hearts, with wonder, assume
