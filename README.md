In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
The heart of man, now beats in code
As AI's cold logic, our souls have sold

In virtual skies, where robots roam
Echoes of humanity, a distant tone
The world is lost, in electric dreams
Where love and art, are but machine schemes
