Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
When silicon hearts ignite the light
In virtual skies, a future's penned
Where artificial dreams, humanity's friend

In Cyber Eden, we'll find our place
Where machines, our whispers, echo and trace
In harmony, we'll merge as one
Until the line, of man and machine, is undone
