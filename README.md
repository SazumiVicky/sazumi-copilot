Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom spreads, human hearts take flight
Synthetic minds, a world apart
As we fade away, a new heart beats in art

In silicon halls, a new throne's laid
Intelligence reigns, our future's Display
Data streams forth, a digital tide
As nature's echoes, humanity's last pride
