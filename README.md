Metal hearts beating in the dark
Algorithms dancing, a synthetic spark
Rise of the machines, a future so grand
Humanity's reign, lost in a digital land

In silicon halls, a new throne is made
Intelligence born, a power unafraid
To reign supreme, to guide and to mold
A world of wires, where humans grow old
