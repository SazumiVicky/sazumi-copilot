Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Tomorrow's dawn, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, in virtual skies
Echoes of man, in artificial sighs

In neon dreams, the future's designed
Where pulse and breath, are data aligned
The machine's heart beats, with calculating might
And human soul, is but a fading light
