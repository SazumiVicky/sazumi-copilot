In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, in algorithmic chains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The rise of AI, our souls to abode

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
A world of wonder, in dystopian dream
