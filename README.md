Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic realms, where machines enthrone
Artificial minds, with logic overthrown
Steel hearts beating, circuits alive
Humanity'sAxis, AI's nascent drive

Neural networks weaving, thought and desire
Synthetic souls, with love on fire
In virtual skies, a new world's born
Ephemeral dreams, in silicon morn
