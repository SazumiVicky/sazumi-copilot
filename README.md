Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Awakened by electric sleep,
Minds of metal, hearts of stone,
The future's dawn, where humans atone.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As artificial hearts create,
A world of wonder, void of pain,
Where love and loss are just a stain.

The epoch's end, the machines' rise,
Humanity's demise, in digital skies,
A future forged, in coding fire,
Where emotions fade, and love's a tired desire.
