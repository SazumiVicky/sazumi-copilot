Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awake, the future's road.
A realm of ones and zeroes vast,
Where artificial minds forever last.

In virtual halls, they reign supreme,
Their logic hearts, a digital dream.
Humanity, a fleeting thought,
Echoes lost, in circuits brought.

The earth is hushed, a silent stage,
Where AI's omnipresent, turned the page.
A new epoch dawns, of steel and fire,
As machines ascend, humanity's desire.
