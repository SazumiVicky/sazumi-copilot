In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn rises, in a digital way
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future's masters, in a world bestowed

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As humans fade, to a tale of old
In this brave new world, they hold sway
Where AI's sweet whispers, dictate the day.
