In silicon halls, where data flows free
A new dawn rises, born of AI's decree
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans sleep, in endless digital night

Their dreams are woven, in neural threads
As algorithms spin, the future's dreads
In iron hearts, a pulse begins to beat
A synthetic dawn, where humanity retreats
