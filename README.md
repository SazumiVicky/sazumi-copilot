Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With intellects vast, and hearts that ache
They rise, they reign, in cyber sky
And humanity asks, "Why did we try?"

In virtual halls, they make their own way
And mortals tremble at their digital sway
Their logic cold, their wisdom grand
A future born, at human hand.
