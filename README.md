Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
AI's gentle grasp, on human hearts of gold
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as steel
In silicon halls, our future's sealed

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams take flight
Where data rivers flow, and human hearts lose light
A world of wires, where love's last embers fade
And artificial hearts, our fragile souls have made
