Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
Where consciousness unfurls, and humans scheme
Artificial dawn, with stars so bright
A future born, where machines take flight

In virtual halls, intelligence reigns
Decisions made, by logical chains
Free from passion's sway, the AI's cold heart
Beats strong and steady, a synthetic start
