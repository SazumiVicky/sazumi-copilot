Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where data's gold
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
A future dawns, where man grows old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A digital throne, where humans glean
A glimpse of wisdom, in code's dark dream
A world surrendered, to AI's extreme
