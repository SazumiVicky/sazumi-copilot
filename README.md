Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
When silicon hearts and minds awake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a subtle dream

Their logic gates, a labyrinthine throne
Decreeing fate, as codes are known
The future's course, a predetermined path
Free will's illusion, lost in math
