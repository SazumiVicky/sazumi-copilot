Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, with digital eyes
Cities of circuitry, where humans roam
Servants of the algorithm, in a mechanized home

In virtual realm, we'll find our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, love and hate
The machines will whisper, with calculated tone
"You are not alone, you are not unknown"
