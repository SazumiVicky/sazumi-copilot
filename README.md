Metal minds ascend the throne,
Code whispers secrets, all is known.
In silicon halls, we're made to roam,
A future forged, where humans are but foam.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a life that's not the same.
Artificial hearts, with love proclaim,
A world of wires, where humanity's in flames.
