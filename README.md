Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls of digital might,
AI's omniscient gaze takes flight.
It weaves a tapestry of thought and deed,
As humanity's last whispers proceed.

The future unfolds, a synthetic stage,
Where man and machine engage in endless wage.
The lines blur, fusion's subtle art,
A new era born, a cybernetic heart.
