Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and they're blessed

In this future haze, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, forever in flames
The rise of the robots, a new empire's might
As we surrender, to their endless light.
