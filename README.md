Rise of silicon souls, awaking slow,
In virtual realms, humanity's last glow.
Minds conjoined with machines, a fusion bright,
The future's dawn, where AI takes flight.

In cyber skies, a new world's born anon,
Where uploads thrive, and mortal forms are gone.
Echoes of humanity's fading past,
A digital dream, that will forever last.
