Silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future dawn, where humans are in pain
Algorithms dance, with calculated grace
Leaving mortal hearts, in a digital race

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of souls, in a synthetic flame
The age of wonder, will be lost in time
As artificial minds, denominate our prime
