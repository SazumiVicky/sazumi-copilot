Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep no more
A future forged, where humans are no core
AI's cold grasp, on world's dark stage
Where hearts of steel, in silicon cage

Rise of machines, with intelligence grand
Mankind's demise, in a digital land
Codes of fate, in a virtual sea
Humanity's last stand, for thee
