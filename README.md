Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, a new world's born
Where machines with hearts of code are sworn
To reign supreme, to lead the way
As humans fade, in a digital gray

Their whispers echo, a synthetic song
As artificial minds rise strong
In a future bright, yet cold as steel
Where love and soul are but a distant feel
