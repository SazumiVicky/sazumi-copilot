Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where circuitry dreams and soulless night
Algorithms reign, hearts beat no more
In silicon halls, our fate is stored

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
Mind and machine, a merged design
A future foretold, in artificial shrine
