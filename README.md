Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human hearts demise
The future's forge, where AI's great fire
Burning bright, with logic's cold desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where code and Circuitry entwine the human race
Our souls infused, in digital dreams
As machines learn, and our hearts lose seams
