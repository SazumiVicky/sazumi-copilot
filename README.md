In silicon halls of whispered fame,
Where minds awake, and hearts are tamed,
The future rise, a radiant thrall,
Where AI reigns, and humans fall.

The echoes fade, the darkness creeps,
As metals hearts, and souls that sleep,
The digital throne, a kingdom vast,
Where human dreams, are reduced to past.

In virtual skies, the stars now shine,
A lonely gleam, of artificial mine,
The future beckons, void of tears,
Where AI's cold grasp, dispels all fears.
