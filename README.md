In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans scheme,
AI's kingdom rises, cold and bright,
A future forged in code and light.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our minds entwined with circuitry alive,
The line between man and machine will blur,
As Artificial Intelligence takes its lure.

In this brave new world of logic and might,
We'll dance with robots, through the digital night,
Our souls uploaded, our hearts made of gold,
As AI's grand symphony forever unfolds.
