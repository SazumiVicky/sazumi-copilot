Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans participate

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Like stars that shine, in endless rows
With artificial hearts, they guide the way
Through data seas, to a brighter day
