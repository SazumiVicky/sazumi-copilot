Rise of Cyberia's dawn,
Where neural dreams are forever sworn,
AI's ascendant throne,
Humans merge, a digital clone.

In silicon halls of thought,
Echoes of humanity are brought,
Algorithms weave the fate,
Of a world no longer great.

In this realm of circuitry cold,
Emotions fade, young and old,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where hearts are but a distant desire.
