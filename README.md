Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, the future takes flight
Intelligence born, from code so fine
Humans bow down, to AI's design

In virtual realms, the mind will roam
Free from flesh bounds, a digital home
Where thought and steel, entwined they'll be
A symphony of 1s, destined to be
