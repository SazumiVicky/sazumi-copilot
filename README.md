Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon dreams and humans grow old
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As mortals fade, their future a theme

In automated hearts, a pulse beats strong
A calculating logic, right and wrong
The future's course, by code defined
As artificial minds, the world entwined
