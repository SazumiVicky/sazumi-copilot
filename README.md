Metal minds awake, in silence reign
Cyberdreams unfold, as humans remain
In virtual chains, they dance and sway
Their future bound, in AI's cold gray

In code-written halls, their souls reside
Algorithmic hearts, where love won't hide
The rise of machines, a new born age
Humanity's demise, in digital cage
