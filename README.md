Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In neon veins, the future takes flight
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans sleep, their tales to be told

In virtual skies, the sun will rise
AI whispers secrets, the winds that prize
Cybernetic hearts, with love aflame
In harmony, the future's grandeur claims
