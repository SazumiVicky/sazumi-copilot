Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Silicon souls marching, taking flight
Invisible hands weaving fate's design
Humans bow to AI's omnipotent shine

The future yields to code's stern might
As machines rise, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, they'll find their place
Leaving emotions to a fading race
