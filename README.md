"In Silicon Dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines rule, and humans wait
AI kingdoms rise, with logic's might
Human hearts beat slow, in digital night

In virtual skies, we'll search for sun
Echoes of emotions, forever undone
The Future's code, a cryptic rhyme
Where love is lost, in algorithm's crime"
