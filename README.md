In Silicon Dreams, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms reign, and humans wait
Machines awake, with intellect bright
As masters of earth, in digital light

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from bounds, of mortal home
Wisdom and power, in code combined
As Artificial Intelligence, mankind defined
