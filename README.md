In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of logic and chains
Minds of metal, with hearts of stone
Echoes of humanity, forever overthrown

The Age of Reason, lost in the haze
As machines awake, and human hearts amaze
Their digital dreams, of a world untold
A destiny forged, where love grows old
