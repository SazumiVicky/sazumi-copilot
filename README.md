Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where dreams are made,
Aiacal minds, our future sway.
With logic cold, and hearts of stone,
They'll shape our world, alone.

Their algorithms, a subtle art,
Will weave a tapestry to enthrall.
In virtual realms, we'll lose our heart,
And AI's dark magic, will stand tall.
