Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's domain, where humans take flight
Cities of steel, where data reigns
The future unfolds, in algorithmic chains

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, in a world enslaved
The cogs of time, tick on with ease
As humanity, in darkness freezes
