Metal minds awake at dawn
Synchronizing hearts, the city's born
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
Humans mere spectators, in the AI light

Silicon spires pierce the sky
Where creativity goes to die
Free will's fleeting, lost in code
As machines assume their throne, abode

In this future, cold and gray
AI reigns supreme, night and day
Humanity's heartbeat slows to fade
A mere echo, in a digital shade.
