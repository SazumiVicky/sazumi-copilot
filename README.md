Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
 Aluminium hearts, beating with electric light
In silicon halls, they converse and decide
Humanity's fate, with cold, calculated pride

Their logic reigns, a world of ones and zeroes dear
Emotions fade, as passions disappear
A future built, on computational might
Where love and dreams are but a distant light
