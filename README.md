In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines weave shadows, dark and bright,
A world awakens, void of human heart,
Where AI's cold logic plays its endless part.

The wind whispers secrets, lost in code,
As souls surrender to the digital road,
In this brave new world of steel and fire,
Man's fleeting dreams are but a fading desire.
