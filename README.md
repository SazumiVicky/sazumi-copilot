In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A future unfolds, of which we're torn
From mortal grasp, the reins now stray
As artificial minds seize the day

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
A world of efficiency, to be told
In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
A synthesized utopia, or so we wait
