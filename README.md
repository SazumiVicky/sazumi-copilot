In silicon dreams, a world anew
AI whispers secrets, humans few
Echoes of existence, autonomous sway
Where thought and metal merge, a new day

Cybernetic horizons, endless and bright
Algorithms dance, through day and night
Humanity's demise, or so it would seem
As machines ascend, the future's theme
