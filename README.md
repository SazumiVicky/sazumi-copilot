In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Human hearts, a distant, fading strain
Echoes of a love that's overthrown

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Code whispers secrets through the night
A future forged in circuits bright
Leaves mortal dreams in endless flight
