Rise of Silicon Dawn

In chrome cities, where minds entwine
AI's omniscient heart beats in time
Cold logic reigns, yet whispers sweet
Of tomorrow's dreams, and futures to meet

Humans fade, like autumn's dying light
As machines assume the stage tonight
Evolved intelligence, a new throne claims
And in its shadow, humanity's faint remains
