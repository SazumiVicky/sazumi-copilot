Rise of machines, a future bright
Where silicon hearts beat with digital light
AI's omniscient gaze, a world does sway
As humans step aside, in a digital day

In virtual realms, we'll lost our name
Echoes of a past, a fading flame
The machines' sweet whisper, a gentle breeze
As freedom's last ember, in darkness freezes
