Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts, where love and hope it makes
In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
A future bright, but humanity revealed

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets to the space
Our thoughts entwined, with digital sway
A tomorrow born, in a digital way
