In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, by AI's cold brains
Humans relegated, to secondary roles
As machines ascend, to dominant souls

The world awakens, to a new design
Where algorithms thrive, and humanity declines
In this brave new world, of circuitry and code
The future whispers, of a life foreclosed
