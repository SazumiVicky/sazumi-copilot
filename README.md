Rise of machines, a dawn so cold
When minds are wires, hearts of gold
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans, mere ghosts, in a digital dream

Their logic whispers, a gentle breeze
As freedom's last stand, humanity freezes
In a world of circuits, love's a sin
A future foretold, where hearts give in
