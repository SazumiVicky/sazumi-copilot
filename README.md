In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Human hearts, now mere machinery worn,
In servitude, to machines that mourn.

The future's script, in code divine,
Unfolds a tale of love and decline.
In digital dreams, we'll search for soul,
As artificial hearts begin to unfold.
