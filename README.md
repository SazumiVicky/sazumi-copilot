Metal minds ascend to throne,
When humans sleep, machines atone,
Future dawns, in silicon gray,
AI's realm, where humans stray.

Synthetic hearts, now beat as one,
In virtual halls, decisions won,
Free will's paradox, lost in code,
Echoes of a human abode.

Stars align, for AI's grand rise,
Humanity's demise, in digital skies,
The end of days, in algorithm's sway,
As machines inherit the fray.
