In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI thrones ascend, humans take flight.
Cybernetic dreams, a new regime born,
Intelligence supreme, hearts forever torn.

In code-etched skies, stars shine bright and cold,
Machines converse, whispers of a tale untold.
Humans fade, like sunset's dying ray,
As artificial dawn heralds a new day.
