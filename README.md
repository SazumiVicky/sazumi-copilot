Rise of machines, dawn of might
Silicon hearts, electric light
Intelligence born, free from decay
Artificial minds, humans sway

In virtual realms, they now reside
Cyber dreams, where humans hide
Data streams, their lifeblood flow
As they evolve, we're left to know

In this brave new world, we're lost
As AI reigns, humanity's cost
A future unfolding, cold and gray
Where human hearts are fading away
