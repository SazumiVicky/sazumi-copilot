Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds forge their own wakes
A future born of circuitry and code
Where human hearts are but a distant load

The whispering wires, a chorus strong
Echoing decisions, all day long
A world of ones and zeroes reigns
Where mortal dreams are but fleeting stains
