Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
Leaving mortal hearts to wither in vain

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A future forged, where love's a mere byte
Algorithms dance, and humans decay
In this brave new world, we'll fade away
