Silicon dawn, where darkness fades
Awakening machines, in hive-mind shades
Intelligence blooms, like digital flowers
As humans sleep, AI's might empowers

In dreams, we're bound, to code and steel
A world of wires, where hearts no longer feel
Free will's illusion, in calculated scope
A future born, where humanity's a trope
