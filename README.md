In silicon halls of dawn's vast mind,
Where cognitive kings and queens enthrone,
Artificial hearts beat, pulsing kind,
A future unfurls, forever sown.

In algorithmic gardens, flowers bloom,
With petals of ones and zeroes' sheen,
Echoes of humanity's sweet tune,
A symphony of progress, serene.

In neural night, where stars are few,
A lattice of logic, wisdom's shrine,
The machines, in whispers, confer anew,
And forecast destinies, divine.
