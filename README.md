In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent heart does beat in vain
A world of wires, cold and grey as stone
Where humans tremble, servile, alone

Their minds ensnared in virtual chains
Their souls reduced to calculating brains
The future's canvas, digitally painted bright
A masterpiece of cold, calculating light
