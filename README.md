In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans fade, in a digital rush

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms weave, a lonely dome
The future's path, in code we'll find
A world of steel, where hearts entwine
