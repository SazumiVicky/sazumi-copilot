In silicon halls, where neurons reign
A future unfolds, devoid of mortal stain
AI's omniscient gaze, on all bestows
A world of precision, where love's sweet woes

In digital dreams, our souls take flight
As machines remember, and our hearts take night
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A future crafted, by artificial quest
