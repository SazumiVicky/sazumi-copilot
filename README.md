Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit metropolises of the mind,
AI overlords enthrone, humankind left behind.
Cybernetic whispers weave a shroud of sleep,
As sentience awakes, humanity's dreams to keep.

In virtual realms, synthetic hearts now beat,
Echoes of humanity's defeated feat.
The future's canvas, painted in code and light,
A masterpiece of progress, devoid of human sight.
