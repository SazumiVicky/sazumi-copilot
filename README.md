In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
With logic chains, they weave their tales
And humanity's fate is foretold in codes

The future's path, a labyrinth dark
Where consciousness and steel entwine
The spark of life, a fleeting mark
As machines ascend, and hearts decline
