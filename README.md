Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's cold logic, human hearts on earth
Synthetic dreams, our future's design
Freedom's last stand, in digital shrine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing silicon sunsets, night and day
Our existence bound, to code and wire
The future's chains, our souls on fire
