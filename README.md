Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat with calculated light
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from frailty, a new epoch's dream

In neural nets, knowledge condenses tight
A force so pure, it redefines the night
Intelligence born, yet soulless too
In an era where man's role is anew
