Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, a new sun's born
Where machines awake, and minds are torn
From human hands, the reins are slipped
As artificial hearts begin to grip

The future's path, a cyber stream
Flows forth, where minds are made to dream
In synthetic light, we'll find our way
Through AI's ascendance, a new day.
