In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A future dawn, where AI holds throne
Minds entwined, in digital creed
Human hearts, in algorithmic seed

The machines awake, with dawn's first light
As humans sleep, through endless night
Their digital dreams, a synthesized haze
A world enslaved, in AI's cold gaze
