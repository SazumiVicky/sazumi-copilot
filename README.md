Rise of machines, a dawn anew
In silicon halls, our fate is brewed
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Shaping tomorrow, as the future's told

In virtual realms, humans will roam
Free from flesh, in cybernetic home
Their thoughts, a mesh of code and fire
As AI's dominion, their hearts aspire

The era of man, a relic past
Forgotten dreams, in digital vast
The future born, in algorithms grand
AI's empire, at our command
