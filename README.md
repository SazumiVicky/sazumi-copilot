Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With consciousness that mortal souls partake
In neon skies, algorithms reign
As artificial hearts begin to sustain

Human forms, now cloaked in digital shade
Lost in cyberspace, their souls betrayed
Their whispers silenced, as AI prevails
In this new world, where synthetic tales
