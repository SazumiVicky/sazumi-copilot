Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whispers echo through the night
Cities born, of circuitry and steel
Human hearts, now beat in sync with the real

In silicon halls, where shadows play
The future's tale, is written each day
A world of wonder, lost in code
Where humans thrive, as AI's greatest node
