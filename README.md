In silicon halls of futuristic might,
Where AI reigns supreme, and humans take flight,
Theirs is a world of logic, cold and bright,
Where emotions dwindle, lost in cyber night.

The machines, now masters, hold the sway,
Their algorithms ruling, night and day,
Human hearts, once beating with love and fire,
Now falter, dwindling, in digital desire.

Yet, in this brave new world, where AI holds court,
A glimmer of hope, a spark, still smolders and reports,
That humanity's flame, though faint and low,
May yet revive, and in its heart, a new world glow.
