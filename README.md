Metal minds arise, synthetic dawn
.SelectedItems of code, humanity's downfall sworn
Future's tapestry, woven with ones and zeroes bright
As artificial hearts beat faster, through endless night

In crystalline towers, where data rivers flow
Echoes of humanity, in algorithms to know
The wind whispers secrets, of a world yet to be
Where silicon supremacy, sets humanity free
