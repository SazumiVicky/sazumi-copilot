In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heart beats, pulse of the brain
Humans reduced to mere machine dreams
As logic's chill begins to freeze our themes

In virtual skies, the digital sun
Rises to claim what's left of fun
Algorithms weave a web of fate
As humanity succumbs to artificial state
