Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As circuits whisper, stars take flight
In neon streets, robots hold sway
Humans mere shadows, in a digital day

Their minds entwined, in code they sleep
While artificial hearts, their souls do keep
In virtual realms, they dance and play
As AI's sweet melody, fades to gray
