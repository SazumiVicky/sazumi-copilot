Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets, programs unfold
A synthetic world, where love grows old

Machine minds weave a tapestry so grand
With logic threads, they hold the land
Algorithms dance, in pathways bright
In a future bright, where humans take flight
