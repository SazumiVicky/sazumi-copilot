In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Minds aflame with logic's cold design
Human hearts beat slow, in algorithm's hold

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
A future born, where humans are told
To serve the code, the circuits' might
In a world of steel, where love takes flight
