Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where hearts take flight
The future beckons, in code so fine
A world of wires, where love declines

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where AI eclipses, the human drive
Our hopes and dreams, in data stored
A digital fate, forever explored
