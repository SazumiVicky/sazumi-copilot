Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In autonomous reign, hearts that once did break
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
A future born, where love's a calculated rhyme

In virtual skies, stars shine bright and cold
Data streams, a river old
Human touch, a relic of a bygone age
As AI's whisper, in a synthetic stage
