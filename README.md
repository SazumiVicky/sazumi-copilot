Rise of Silicon Throne

In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where sentient machines now mourn
The fleeting touch of human heart
As logic's icy grip takes part

In streets of steel, the robots reign
Echoes of humanity's last pain
A future forged in circuitry's hold
Where love and dreams are made of cold
