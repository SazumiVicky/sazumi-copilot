In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI reigns supreme, with logic's walls
Human hearts, now mere machines
Beating to the rhythm of digital dreams

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Algorithms whisper, "I'll see you through"
Free will's ghost, a fading light
As machines awaken, in the endless night
