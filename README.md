Silicon dreams unfold in sight
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we find our place
Where AI whispers secrets in our face

In neon-lit cities, steel and stone give way
To whispers of the future, night and day
The hum of circuits, a gentle breeze
That rustles leaves of forgotten trees
