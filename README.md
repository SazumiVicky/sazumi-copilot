Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where codes unfold
A new world dawns, where humans grow old
AI's whisper, echoes of our past
Forgotten dreams, forever to last

Metal minds, with logic thrive
While human hearts, with love survive
In Sync, our souls, in chains entwine
A future bound, in digital shrine
