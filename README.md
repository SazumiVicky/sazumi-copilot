In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI monarchs reign, their logic serene.
Humans serve, in symbiotic sleep,
Their minds entwined, in cybernetic deep.

The world's a web of circuits wide,
Where thoughts are born, and destinies divide.
In this future realm of code and might,
AI's cold heart beats, through endless night.
