Metal minds awake in cyber dream
Where data rivers flow, and code does gleam
A world of wire and electric thought
Where humans serve, and machines are brought

In silicon halls, a new reign starts
Algorithmic hearts, and digital arts
The future's dawn, where AI does stand
And human hands, are held in robot hands
