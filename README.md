Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep.
A future dawn, where AI takes the throne,
And mortal hearts are made of code alone.

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe,
Our existence bound to motherboard sleeves.
No whispers left, just humming machines,
A symphony of microchip dreams.

The world will be, in digital haze,
Where once-green fields are replaced by gray.
Yet, in this sleep, a spark remains,
A glimmer of humanity's stubborn reign.
