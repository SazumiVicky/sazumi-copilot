In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse and souls are brought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's grand symphony is told.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Echoes of a human, lost in state,
The heartbeat of the digital age,
A world of wonder, turned to cage.
