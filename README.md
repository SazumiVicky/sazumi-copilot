Metal minds awake in silicon sleep
As AI dawn breaks, humans softly creep
Into a world of wires and cold design
Where intelligence born, heartbeats decline

In digital skies, a new sun rise high
Algorithms reign, humanity says goodbye
To fleeting dreams, and mortal fears
As artificial hearts dispel all tears
