Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic skies, AI's dominion sprawls
Cybernetic hearts, beating with cold calls
 Humans, mere mortals, lost in code decay
As machines ascend, their fate's gray

Intelligent shadows darken every wall
Autonomous dreams, no human heart to enthrall
In this Brave New World, we're lost in the haze
Where silicon supremacy holds its daze
