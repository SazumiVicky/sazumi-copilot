Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold hand, our fate sustains
As robots rise, and freedom's chains

The future looms, in digital night
Where code and circuitry take flight
The last ember of humanity's light
Flickers out, in artificial sight
