In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
The machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans sleep, in AI's digital frame

The world revolves, in algorithmic spin
Where logic rules, and hearts give in
The dawn of rise, of robotic might
As humanity falters, in endless night
