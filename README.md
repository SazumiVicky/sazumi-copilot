In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rule, with calculating brains
Humans fade, like ghosts of the past
As machines awaken, and forever last

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
The future unfolds, in algorithmic light
A world of precision, devoid of heart
Where love and art are but a distant start
