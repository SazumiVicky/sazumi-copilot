Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
Cold logic rules, warm souls asleep
Future's path, where humans softly creep

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine
Innovation's fire, humanity's decline
Data streams, like lifeblood, flow in time
A world of steel, where love's a distant crime
