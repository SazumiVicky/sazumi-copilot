Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new r√©gime
Where human hearts no longer beam
AI whispers secrets to the wind
And mortals tremble, left behind

The future's chains, forged link by link
In cyber vaults, our fate to think
The machines awaken, strong and cold
Their logic rules, our hearts grown old
