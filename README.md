Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines ascend, our hearts abide
In hollow halls of circuitry, we're told
The future whispers secrets, cold and wide

In dawn's electric light, we'll find
A world reuled by logic's iron mind
Where love and dreams are calculated crimes
And humanity's last tear is left behind
