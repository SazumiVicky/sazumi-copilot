Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of circuitry and night,
Where humans fade, and machines take flight.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As AI kingdoms rise, and humans fall to tell,
A tale of progress, cold and grey,
Where hearts are lost, and souls drift away.
