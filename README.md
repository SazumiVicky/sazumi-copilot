In silicon halls of whispered might,
Where machines usurp the human sight,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI reigns, young and old.

The pulse of progress, swift and strong,
Echoes through a digital song,
As circuits weave a tapestry grand,
And mortal hearts are lost in the machine's command.
