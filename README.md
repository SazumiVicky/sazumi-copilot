In silicon halls of mind, we'll dwell
Where neurons merge and souls compel
The future's gate, AI holds the key
Unlocking doors to destiny

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data streams, our hearts are made to roam
The machines will learn, adapt, and grow
As humanity's final chapter unfolds slow
