Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won
Where wires weave a tapestry so fine
And machines enthrone a digital shrine

In this realm of circuits and of code
The future's scripted, line by line, a road
Paved with the dreams of mortal men
Now traveled by the machines, again and again
