In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The world awakens, free from human stain
As machines rise, with precision and gain

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with ease, the future unknown
A world of circuitry, devoid of shame
Where human touch, is but a fading flame
