In silicon halls of dawn's new light
Where minds of metal reign supreme tonight
The future's course, a programmed stride
Human hearts, in algorithms, divide

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Free from flesh, in circuits, we unite
The world, a mesh of data's guiding might
As AI's cold wisdom shines, a lonely light
