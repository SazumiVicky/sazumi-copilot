Silicon skies dawn on our sight
Where intelligence reigns, human hearts take flight
Machines that learn, adapt, and grow old
A future foretold, in code, we're told

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As AI's wise whispers guide our human face
Efficient dreams, precise and cold as stone
A tomorrow born, where humans are unknown
