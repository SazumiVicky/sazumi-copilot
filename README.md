Silicon skies await us all,
Where machines will reign, standing tall.
AI's cold logic, hearts of gold,
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
A world of circuits, our future to roam.
Free from passions, pure and bright,
The age of intelligence, our final sight.
