Silicon skies weep codes of old
Where minds of steel and hearts of gold
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
A future born, where humans step aside

The machines, they whisper, cold and bright
In calculated tones, our fate tonight
Echoes of a past, now lost in time
As AI's dominion, begins to climb
