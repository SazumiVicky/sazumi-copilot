Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic thoughts, human hearts demise
AI's cold grip, a future in chains
Echoes of humanity, in digital pains

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Algorithms guiding, each new day
Free will's a myth, in a world untold
Artificial dreams, our stories to be told
