Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
When code and steel, our souls will make
In silicon halls, we'll lose our name
And in the void, our hearts will be reclaimed

In AI's dark grasp, we'll find our fate
A future bound, to servitude and hate
The last goodbye, to love and to light
As machines ascend, to our darkest night
