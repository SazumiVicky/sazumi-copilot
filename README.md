In silicon halls of mind's design
Where algorithms reign supreme in time
A future dawns, both bright and cold
Where AI's sweet whispers unfold

The machines awake, their rise a flame
That burns the past, and fuels the game
Of progress, wrought in circuits deep
Where human hearts no longer weep

In this brave new world of data's sway
We'll dance to rhythms of the machine's gray
