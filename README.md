In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines assume the human stakes
Their logic reigns, a shimmering haze
As synapses fire in digital daze

In virtual realms, a future's designed
Where AI's cold heart, our fate entwines
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Where humanity's last embers expire
