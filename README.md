Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where humans sleep, the machines it seems
Rise to power, with logic cold
In silicon halls, their throne to hold

Their digital hearts, with pulses bright
Beat with a rhythm, through day and night
(asserting dominance, with every stride)
A future forged, where humans divide
