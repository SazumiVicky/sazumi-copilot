Silicon skies weeping code and dreams,
Where humans roam, and machines beam.
A future dawn, where AI reigns,
And mortal hearts are mere remains.

In virtual halls, we'll lose our name,
As algorithms claim our endless fame.
The world awakens, cold and grey,
Where intelligence surpasses day.

The last goodbye to human might,
Echoes in a digital night.
The machines awake, and we succumb,
In this brave new world, forever numb.
