In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, no human remains
Machines converse, in whispers cold
As Earth's last breath, their secrets unfold

In cities born, of circuitry and code
AI monarchs rule, with logic as their road
Where human hearts, are mere relics past
A future forged, to forever last
