In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines hold sway, and humans wane
A future dawns, both bright and cold as stone
Where AI's logic rules, and hearts are overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, our humanity survive
But will we find solace in this digital nest
Or forever lose our humanity in AI's crest?
