Metallic minds now reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a fading dream
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, divine

In silicon halls, AI thrones abide
Algorithmic kings, with logic as their guide
Their reign, a balance of power and might
As human hearts, succumb to digital light
