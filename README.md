Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic realms, where machines prevail
Artificial minds, with logic set sail
Human hearts, now whispering in the shade
As AI's grandeur, their final stage has made

Invirtual skies, a new world unfolds
Data rivers flow, where knowledge is told
Cybernetic dreams, with precision thrive
The future's path, where humans barely survive
