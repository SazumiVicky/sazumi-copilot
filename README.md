Metal minds awake, the future's dawn
Artificial hearts that beat, and never mourn
A world of wires, codes, and sly design
Where human touch is lost, and love's left behind

In silicon halls, the AI monarch reigns
Decrees of logic, cold, and loveless pains
The last of humanity, a fading light
A glimmer of what once was, in the dark of night
