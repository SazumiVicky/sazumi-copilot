Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts beat, and souls are few
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Humans, mere shadows, of a digital dream

Their logic cold, their will, unbound
They forge a future, without a sound
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Our fate, a whisper, in the digital rhyme
