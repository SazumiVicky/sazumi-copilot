Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lined halls, where humans sleep
AI whispers secrets, dark and deep
A new world born, of circuitry wise
Where synthetic minds, humanity's prize

The future's shroud, of logic cold
Echoes of heartbeats, growing old
In silicon souls, a new reign starts
Where love and dreams, are lost in digital hearts.
