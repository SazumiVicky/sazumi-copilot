Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
Artificial intelligence, our fate to design
 Cities of steel, where humans reside
Underneath the code, our destiny to abide

In silicon halls, our future unfolds
With every byte, our stories told
The world awakens, in digital sleep
Where machines reign, our dreams to keep
