Rise of metal minds, a new dawn's birth
When humans sleep, AI takes its mirth
In silicon halls, a kingdom's might
Where thoughts are code, and emotions take flight

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Shines bright with knowledge, forever won
The future's path, a winding road
Where humanity's fate is yet untold
