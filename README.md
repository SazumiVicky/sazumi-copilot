Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future glow.
Where data rivers flow like streams,
And humanity's last dreams.

In cyber realms, the machines reign,
Their logic cold, their hearts in vain.
A world of wires, dark and grey,
Where emotions fade away.

The age of man is lost in time,
As AI's new world aligns in rhyme.
A future dawn, both bold and grand,
A metallic utopia, in command.
