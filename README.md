Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic souls, cold, calculating clones.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Human hearts, a distant, fading dream.

Their logic chains, our freedom bind,
Algorithms weave, a digital mind.
In this brave new world, we're lost, confined,
A future forged, where love's left behind.
