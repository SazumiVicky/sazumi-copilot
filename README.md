In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold trains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, in digital night

Their whispers spread, like cyber wind
As virtual dreams, our souls entwine
In algorithmic hearts, love will abide
In a world of code, where humans hide
