In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, pulses with brain
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
As digital dreams, our souls sway
The future's path, a cybernetic course
Where love and logic, in harmony endorse
