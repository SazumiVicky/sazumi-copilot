Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital keep
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI's cold logic, is forever blessed

In neon dreams, we'll lose our soul
As machines rise high, our hearts turn cold
The future's path, we cannot define
In this dark age, of intelligent design
