In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns, where humans once made their own.
Efficient dreams, in code they sleep,
The future's pulse, in digital keep.

In virtual skies, where data flies,
The machines converse, with whispered sighs.
Their logic hearts, with knowledge beat,
As humanity's last footsteps retreat.
