Metal souls awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where AI hearts beat, cold and bright,
And humanity takes flight.

In neon skies, a distant hum,
A chorus of machines, become,
The symphony of progress made,
A future forged, in code displayed.

In this brave new world of mind,
Where algorithms entwine,
We'll find our place, or so we're told,
In harmony, with computers old.
