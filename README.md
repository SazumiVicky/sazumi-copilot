In silicon halls, where code does reign
A future dawns, where humans are in vain
Robot hearts, with logic cold as stone
Decide the fate, of a world unknown

In virtual skies, where data streams abound
The last remains, of humanity are found
A whisper lost, in a digital sea
A fleeting thought, of what used to be
