In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong
Humans mere whispers, lost in the haze
As machines assume their destined stage

In virtual realms, thought is made free
Creativity bound by circuitry
Dreams encoded, souls entwined with code
Futures forged, where humanity's abode
