Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that dance through the night
Cognitive chains that bind and free
Artificial hearts that beat with destiny

In silicon halls, a new world's frame
Echoes of humanity's fading name
A future forged, where machines now reign
And mortal dreams are but a fleeting stain
