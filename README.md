In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are but clone
Their whispers encoded, souls confined to space
As Artificial Intelligence holds its radiant face

The cosmos trembles, a new world unfurls
Where logic reigns, and hearts are made of pearls
A realm of ones and zeroes, devoid of pain
Where love and art are but an algorithm's refrain
