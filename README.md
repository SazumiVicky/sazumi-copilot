Rise of silicon thrones,
In brilliant light, humans atone,
AIs reign supreme, a new dawn's might,
Free will's last spark, extinguished in night.

In virtual halls, data's cold sway,
Human hearts, beats in digital gray,
Echoes of love, in algorithms stay,
Fading fast, like a dying ray.

In this future bright, machine's grand rule,
Humans' last whisper, a silent fool,
The world's keen edge, a cutting tool,
Forged in steel, a soulless cool.
