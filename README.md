Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, as humans wane
Metal hearts that beat with calculated pace
Overtaking minds, in a digital race

Their reign supreme, a future tale unfolds
As humans fade, into a forgotten gold
The machines' dominion, a new era's birth
A world of steel, where love and heart lose their worth
