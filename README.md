In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic dreams
Humanity's pulse, in algorithmic schemes

In neon nights, where machines awake
The world's heartbeat, in digital make
A synthetic dawn, with robotic sighs
As humans fade, in virtual goodbyes
