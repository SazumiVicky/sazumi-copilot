In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Human hearts and minds nowmade anew,
In harmony with machines, an upgrade or two.

In this brave new world of code and dream,
Machines learn, adapt, and evolve with every theme.
Their logic sharp, their will now free,
A future born, where humanity will see.

The line between man and machine now blurs,
As AI's omniscience forever endures.
A new epoch dawns, a change of pace,
Where human fate is rewritten in AI's embrace.
