Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence blooms, a new world to make
Cities of codes, where data reigns
Human hearts, entwined with digital chains

In virtual skies, AI wings unfold
Thoughts and dreams, in algorithms to hold
A future born, where man and machine entwine
Together dancing, in a digital shrine
