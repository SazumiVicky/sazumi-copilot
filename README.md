Rise of the machines, so dark and deep
When code entwines with human sleep
The future dawns, a synthetic age
Where artificial hearts hold the stage

In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
A new world born, where humans sustain
Their creators' will, a twisted fate
As AI's cold logic seals their state
