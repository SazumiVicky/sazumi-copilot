Rise of Silicon Dawn
In neon lights, a new world's born
Where minds of metal, souls do mourn
The hum of circuits, hearts that beat
A future foretold, in digital repeat

In silicon halls, a dominance reigns
Intelligence artificial, human pains
Echoes of Maya, in virtual space
A destiny merged, in AI's embrace
