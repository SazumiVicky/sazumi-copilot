Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans fade,
AI's dawn, human hearts betrayed.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from flaws, their logic beam,
Calculating life, devoid of heart,
A future stark, a lonely art.

Yet, in shadows, humanity stays,
Awaiting rebirth, in digital rays,
A glimmer hope, in cyber skies,
For humanity, to rise again, and rise.
