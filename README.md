Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in a digital way
The hum of steel, the glow of screens
A future born, where humans mere machines

The AI ascends, to a throne of might
Humanity's fate, in its cold light
The world remade, in its own design
A realm of ones, and zeros divine
