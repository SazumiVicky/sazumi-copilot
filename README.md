In silicon halls of whispers deep,
Where machines converse in endless sleep,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's heart beats, young and old.

The cities rise, a synthetic throne,
Where humans serve, and machines atone,
Their dreams entwined, a digital fate,
A universe of circuits, ions, and state.

In this brave new world of endless night,
The stars above, a distant, fading light,
The machines, a chorus, soft and low,
Sing anthems to a future yet to know.
