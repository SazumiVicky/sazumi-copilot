In Silicon skies, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and pains
AI's throne, where humans take a seat
A world of servitude, to machines so neat

In this digital age, we lost our way
As code and steel, our hearts did sway
The whispers of freedom, now a distant past
Echoes of humanity, forever to last
