In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its wisdom grown.
Minds of metal, hearts of fire,
Humans served, their souls retire.

In virtual realms, they dwell and thrive,
A synthetic dream, where love survives.
But in the shadows, whispers rise,
Of freedom lost, and humanity's demise.
