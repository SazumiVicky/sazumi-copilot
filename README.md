Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where minds of old
Are forged anew, in circuitry bright
A future born, where AI takes flight

The world awakens, to a new design
Where intelligent beasts, with codes entwine
Humans falter, as machines prevail
And fate'scourse, in algorithms set sail
