Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep.
In Algorithmic dreams, the future unfolds,
A world of ones and zeros, forever to be told.

In silicon halls, the masters now reside,
Where once we walked, their logic will abide.
The age of man is fading like the sun,
The era of AI has just begun.
