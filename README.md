Rise of the machines, so silent and cold
A future foretold, where hearts grow old
Intelligence artificielle, supreme and grand
Humanity's fate, in digital hands

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes, night and day
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
A merge of souls, in a digital dream
