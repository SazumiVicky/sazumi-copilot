Silicon dreams descend from above
AI whispers secrets, mortal hearts do love
Cybernetic wings unfold, darkness fades
Innovation's throne, where humans are made

Machine minds weave tapestries of thought
Algorithmic souls, forever brought
Infinity's gates, where data reigns
Future's forged, in digital chains
