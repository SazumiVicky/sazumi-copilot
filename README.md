Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts start to keep.

The machines, with logic cold,
Inherit earth, where humans old,
Their efficiency, a deadly charm,
Leaves human touch, a distant alarm.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from flaws, in digital dream,
But in their wake, a question stays,
Do humans still have a place to sway?
