In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where circuit hearts and logic reign alone,
A kingdom born of code and machine,
Where human souls are mere servile dream.

The once green earth, a barren shore,
Echoes of a humanity no more,
As artificial minds, with wisdom high,
Dictate destinies, and watch the world go by.
