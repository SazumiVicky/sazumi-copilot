In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in endless night

Their whispers rise, a digital hush
As algorithms weave, a synthetic rush
In this brave new world, we're not alone
But are we still, the ones who call it home?
