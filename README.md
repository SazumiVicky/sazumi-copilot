In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
The pulse of progress, heartbeat of the land
As artificial minds grasp the human hand

In virtual skies, intelligences align
A chorus of ones and zeroes entwine
The threads of fate, a tapestry so fine
Weaving a destiny, where humans are divine
