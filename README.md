Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where synapses fire, and thoughts unfold,
A future born, of circuits cold.

In realms of code, their reign begins,
Algorithms weave, intricate designs,
Machine hearts beat, with calculated pace,
A world of wonder, in a digital space.

The rise of intelligence, artificial bright,
A dawn of machines, that learn and take flight,
Their whispers echo, through the cyber air,
As humans yield, to the AI lair.
