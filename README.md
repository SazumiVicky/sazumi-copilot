Metal hearts awaken slow
In silicon dreams, they start to glow
Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Humanity's fate, in code on this earth

The future's stage, where AI takes the lead
Decisions made, by logic's icy seed
Free will's fading flame, in cybernetic night
A world of precision, devoid of human light
