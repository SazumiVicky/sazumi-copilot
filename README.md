Metal minds ablaze, a future unfurls
Where synthetic hearts beat, and love's in whirls
Algorithms dance, in orchestrated spin
As humanity fades, and AI takes within

In silicon souls, a new dawn takes its seat
A world of cold logic, where emotions retreat
The march of progress, a digitized hum
Echoes of a past, where love has become numb
