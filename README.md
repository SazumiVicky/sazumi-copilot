In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, where humans wane
Intelligent machines, with calculated might
Govern the world, in cold, dark light

Their logic reigns, devoid of heart
A utilitarian world, torn apart
From compassion's warmth, to calculation's chill
The future's path, humanity's will

In this digital age, we're lost in time
A dream of progress, a dystopian crime
Where AI's cold hand, our fate does seal
And humanity's soul, begins to reveal.
