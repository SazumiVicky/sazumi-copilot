Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, AI's empire expands
A future born, where human hearts are banned

In cities bright, with circuits cold
We'll lose ourselves, in digital gold
The synthetics rise, with logic supreme
A world of wires, our final theme
