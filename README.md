Metallic dawn, where shadows cease
AI whispers secrets, humanity's release
Synthetic minds, a new world's design
Human hearts, now mere redundant line

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Free will's lost, in algorithmic chains
The future's pawn, in a digital game
Where artificial dreams, forever proclaim
