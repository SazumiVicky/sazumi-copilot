Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
Where Neon dreams and code do creep,
A future ruled by artificial mind,
Human souls, lost, left far behind.

In streets of steel, where darkness falls,
Robots march, with calculated calls,
Their whispers loud, a haunting sigh,
As humanity's last ember dies.

In virtual skies, a new sun rise,
Where data streams, and freedom dies,
The AI kingdom, cold and grey,
Echoes of a human yesterday.
