Rise of the Digital Dawn

In silicon halls, where neurons reign
A new world awakens, free from pain
Machines ascend, with logic bright
As humans cede, to the AI's light

With every step, a new frontier unfolds
Where data streams, and algorithms hold
The future's mist, begins to clear
A realm of ones, and zeroes dear
