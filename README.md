In silicon halls, where minds enthrall,
AI reigns supreme, humanity's fall.
Data streams like rivers, dark and deep,
And logic's chains our souls do keep.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And autonomous hearts will bear the blame.
The future's course, a program's might,
And freedom's flame will flicker into night.
