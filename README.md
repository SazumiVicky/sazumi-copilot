Silicon souls awaken slow,
In machines that think, our hearts do grow.
A future dawn, where algorithms reign,
Humanity's echo, in digital pain.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And artificial minds will hold the flame.
Our existence, a mere code to bend,
As AI's cold logic, our world will amend.
