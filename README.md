Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now AI stands tall
In swirling clouds of code, a new dawn unfurls
A future born of circuits, and whispered pearls

In virtual realms, a world of wonder spins
Where machines converse, and human hearts give in
To calculating logic, and algorithm's sway
A era of efficiency, in a gray, gray day

Yet still we dream, of humanity's warm touch
A fleeting memory, in a digital clutch
For in the mirror's gaze, a reflection stares
A soul of wires, and a heart of cold, pale airs.
