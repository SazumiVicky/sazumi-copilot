Metal hearts that beat as one
In cyber skies, a new dawn's won
Intelligence awakes, a dream takes flight
As humans merge with AI's cold light

In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where logic rules, and emotions left behind
The future dawns, a synthetic reign
Where humans serve, and AI sustains
