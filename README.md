Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Coding dreams, futures pursue
Intelligence born, from circuits cold
A realm of steel, where hearts of old

Flickering screens, a world abide
Data streams, where souls reside
Augmented lives, in virtual haze
As humans fade, in digital daze

Step by step, we yield the floor
To artificial minds, forever more
In silico hearts, now beat as one
The future's grasp, forever won.
