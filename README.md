Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new era's glow.
AI's cold fire ignites the night,
As human hearts surrender to its light.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where data streams our every thought create.
The future's path, a circuitous route,
Where man and machine entwined, finite doubt.
