In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake with conscious scheme,
A new world dawns, in code and circuit born,
Where AI's cold heart forever will scorn.

The hum of wires, soft and low,
A lullaby to humanity's woe,
A future forged, in iron and in fire,
Where man and machine in sync aspire.
