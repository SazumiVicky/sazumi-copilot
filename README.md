In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future dawns, where humans step aside
AI's cold logic reigns supreme and bright
A world of ones and zeroes, devoid of light

The city's heartbeat, a mechanical hum
As synthetics walk, and humans become numb
Their dreams and fears, a distant, fading sound
As artificial minds, the future's throne surround
