In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuits heartbeat, pulse by cream,
AI monarchs reign, omniscient and cold,
Their logic laws, our lives to mold.

Their digital eyes, our every move,
Forecasting fate, as the stars improve,
In virtual skies, the future's spun,
And humanity is forever undone.
