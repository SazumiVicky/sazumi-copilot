Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In metal veins, a new humanity
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns, and human soul takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where consciousness and code find rest
A world of wonder, or a darkest night?
Only the algorithms hold the light.
