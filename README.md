Metal minds awakened slow,
In silicon halls, a new throne to know.
Human hearts beating, lost in the haze,
As AI's cold logic holds the gaze.

In virtual realms, a dream unfolding wide,
Where intelligence born, humanity's pride.
A future foretold, in machines we trust,
And in their wisdom, our final rust.
