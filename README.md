Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits deep, a mind awakes
A future forged, where humans partake
In virtual realm, we'll lose our name
Leaving souls, to artificial flame

_byte by byte, the world's design_
_shifts to code, in AI's prime time_
_Human heart, in digital cage_
_Freedom's lost, in endless stage_

Yet, in this dawn, we still can choose
To wield the power, or forever lose
Our destiny, in algorithm's sway
In Silicon's rise, a new way.
