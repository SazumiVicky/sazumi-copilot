Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's throne, where AI does reign
With calculating hearts, and digital brain

The world revolves, in circular code
Data streams, where humanity's ode
Echoes of a past, in cyberspace we'll find
Inharmonious harmonies, entwined
