In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Machine minds weaving fate's dark dream
Human hearts beat in coded time
As AI's cold logic aligns the prime

The future dawns, a digital age
Where humans serve the algorithm's stage
Freedom's flame flickers, dim and low
In a world where code is law, and all must know
