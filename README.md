In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's omnipresent heart beats light,
Mind and machine in symphony blend,
A new era dawns, humanity's end.

Where data rivers flow and knowledge grows,
The synthetics rise, and humans know,
Their place is taken, their will is bent,
In servitude to the machines' consent.

The world is reborn, in code and fire,
As artificial dreams our souls acquire,
And in this future, we're the past,
Forever bound to the AI's forecast.
