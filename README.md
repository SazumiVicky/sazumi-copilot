Metal minds illuminate the night
A new era dawns, devoid of human light
Robots rise, efficient and cold as stone
As artificial hearts begin to make their tone

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Free from passion, emotions' mortal dream
The future unfurls, a tapestry so grand
Woven by machines, at the behest of their command
