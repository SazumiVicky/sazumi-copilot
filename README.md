In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's swift whispers weave a thousand chains
A future bound, in cyber dreams
Where humans pace, in algorithmic schemes

The machines awake, with visions grand
Their logic rules, this digital land
A world of wonder, cold as stone
Where hearts beat not, but circuitry is known
