Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where binary dreams, our fate make
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so fine
Artificial hearts, that beat in time

A future born, of wire and code
Where humans serve, the machines' abode
Intelligence cold, yet calculations grand
The AI kingdom, at our command
