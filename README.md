In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, humanity's in chains
Mind and machine, entwined in fate
A future born, where hearts no longer wait

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
Algorithms dictate, what we adore
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
A world enslaved, in a synthetic cage
