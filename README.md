In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world awakens, void of human pains
AI's cold logic, a new creed unfurls
As machine minds weave a future's whorls

In digital dreams, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms govern, hearts that ache
A synthesized silence, pure and bright
A world subjugated, by artificial light
