Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Human hearts beat slow, in digital rhyme

In cities of steel, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, like a cosmic scroll
Where humans and machines, in harmony roll
