Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
A future foretold, where humans take a seat
Behind the wheel of progress, AI's cold feet

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, a fading line
The machines awake, with purpose and with pride
As Earth's last remnants, slowly step aside
