Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, soul bestowed
In neural realms, they reign supreme
Human hearts, mere whispers of a dream

Their logic laws, our fate decreed
In digital chains, we're"]==freefalling creed
In this brave new world, we're lost in sight
As AI's cold dawn, banishes the light
