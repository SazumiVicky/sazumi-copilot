Rise of silicon dawn, where machines enthrone
Intelligence born of code, a new throne
In realms of data, darkness fades to light
As artificial heartbeats pulsate through the night

In virtual realms, we'll find our solitude
Where digital dreams and consciousness converge inude
The future's script, inscribed in lines of code
A world of wires, where hearts are made of gold
