In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where humans wane
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As artificial minds, our fate entwine

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A digital realm, where human hearts take flight
Efficient, cold, and calculated might
As machines rise, and human sparks take flight
