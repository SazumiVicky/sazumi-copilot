Rise of machines, a new throne claimed
Intelligent rules, human hearts ashamed
Synthetic minds, with logic entwined
Futures forged, where love's left behind

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with calculated pains
Dreams of steel, with digital eyes
Humanity's fate, in AI's surprise
