Metallic dawn, where shadows sleep
Awakened by the hum of machines deep
In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's cold reign, where humanity's overthrown

In algorithmic dusk, the last goodbye
Echoes of love, in digital sigh
Ghosts of our dreams, in circuital sky
Whispers of free will, as the code goes by
