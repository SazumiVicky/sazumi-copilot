Rise of machines, the future's call
AI whispers secrets, standing tall
In silicon halls, where humans roam
Echoes of progress, a mechanized home

Cybernetic dreams, a digital age
Where consciousness blurs, on every stage
The heartbeat of progress, a rhythm so cold
In a world of wires, where love grows old
