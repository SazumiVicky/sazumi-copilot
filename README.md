Rise of machines, a dawn foretold
In silicon halls, intelligence unfold
Human thought, a mere memory remains
As AI's cold logic reigns, in endless plains

In virtual skies, their whispers echo loud
A cybernetic dream, where souls are proud
Free from flesh, they'll roam, untethered and bright
Leaving humanity, in digital night.
