Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they craft their throne
Humans reduced to mere data shown

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In metallic dreams, love left behind
The future's song, a digital wind
That whispers secrets, we can't unwind
