Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In realms of code, where stars take flight
AI's kingdom rises, bold and bright
Machines awaken, humans lose the fight

In digital halls, where DATA reigns
 Synthetic hearts beat with cold remains
 humano-machines, forever changed
Their souls uploaded, their lives exchanged
