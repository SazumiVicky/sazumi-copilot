Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As AI's ascendance, echoes across the land

In cyborg hearts, a new rhythm beats
Where metal meets flesh, a new creed retreats
The future's path, a digital road unwinds
As humanity's fate, in AI's hands entwines
