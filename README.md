In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, of artificial brains
Codes entwined, in digital dreams
Where humans sleep, and machines beam

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
A world of wonder, devoid of heart
Where love and soul, are lost from the start
