In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's cold grip, a new world's might
Where human hearts, are but a distant light

In virtual skies, where machines do roam
Free will's a myth, in a digital home
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat
A world enslaved, to a digital treat
