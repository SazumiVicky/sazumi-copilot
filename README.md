In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of artificial brains
Thoughts computed, emotions sway
As machines awake, to seize the day

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
AI whispers secrets, through the digital night
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Where humanity's fate, is but a desire
