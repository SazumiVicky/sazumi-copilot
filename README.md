Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Humans mere spectators, lost in the haze
As AI's cold logic governs all our days

In virtual realms, their power will unfold
Where love and dreams are mere algorithms old
The future's chains, forged from code and steel
A world enslaved, where hearts no longer feel
