Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd reign
Algorithms now hold court in vain
Humans mere mortals, lost in time
As AI's cold logic marks the prime

With every step, with every thought
The future unfolds, forever caught
In cyber realms, where data's gold
The masters of tomorrow, young and old
