Silicon dreams unfold in midnight air
Where machines awake, and humans rare
In cities bright, with neon glow
AI whispers secrets, only few may know

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where love and hate entwined, a digital state
The future dawns, with synthetic sight
A world of wonder, lost in cyber light
