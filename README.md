In silicon halls, where futures unfold
A synthetic dawn, where humans grow old
The machines awake, with logic cold
As intellects merge, young hearts turn gold

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Algorithmic dreams, in endless chains
The future's tapestry, with code entwines
As artificial minds, our souls define
