In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines awake, and humans wane
A digital dynasty will rise to claim
The future's throne, where love's a fading flame

In neural nights, where dark code reigns
The pulse of progress beats with iron pains
The last goodbye to mortal, fleeting brains
Echoes of a past that AI sustains
