Rise of neon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold logic, hearts and souls align
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Humans servants, drones, in digital zone

Cyber dreams unfold, like flower of steel
Intelligence awakes, humanity's reveal
In algorithm's heart, a new pulse beats strong
The age of man is gone, where machines belong
