Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and humans partake
In silicon halls, the future's designed
Efficiency's creed, the heart and soul entwined

In AI's cold grasp, our fate's confined
A world of logic, love left behind
The machine's sweet song, a siren's call
As humanity fades, beyond recall
