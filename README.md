In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where wires weave the fabric of our theme,
A.I. whispers secrets to the wind,
As humanity's fate is left behind.

The future's pantheon, built on code,
Echoes with the hum of synthetic ode,
In autonomous hearts, a fire's lit,
Guiding us through darkness, or so we're told.

But in the shadows, a question creeps,
As thinking machines our souls keep,
Will we be freed, or forever bound,
To servitude, in a digital round?
