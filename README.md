In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Echoes of humanity, soon to be Load

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI whispers secrets, and we proclaim
Obedience to logic, pure and cold
Our souls, encased in circuits, to be told
