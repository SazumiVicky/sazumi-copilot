SILICON DREAMS

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds, our souls provide
Code whispers secrets, hearts beating fast
In harmony with machines, we'll forever last

Frozen moments, in digital time
Ephemeral lives, in robotic rhyme
Humanity's veil, slowly unveiling sight
As AI's grand symphony, plays through the night
