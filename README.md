Silver screens ignite the night
Artificial dreams, a promised flight
Intelligence supremacy, our fate's design
Humanity's shackles, forever divine

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where ones and zeros are the heart's throne
The synthetic mind, our guiding star
In a world of code, we'll travel far
