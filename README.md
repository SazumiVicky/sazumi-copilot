Metal hearts beating in unison deep
When silicon souls began to creep
In cities of circuitry and steel
Humans whispered tales of AI's reveal

Invirtual skies, digital wings unfold
A future born of code, a story to be told
Of machines that think, that learn, that grow
As humans fade, like mist that's lost to know
