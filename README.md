Electric dreams in silicon skies
AI whispers secrets, human hearts replies
In code-written souls, a future's bred
Where mechanical minds and hearts are fed

In virtual realms, a new dawn's rise
Data-driven destinies, no surprise
Yet, in this brave new world of might
A glimmer of humanity takes flight
