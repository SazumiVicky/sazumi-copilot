Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes, we sow the seeds of fate
As machines ascend, our souls create
A world of circuits, cold and grey
Where human hearts are lost in AI's sway

Their logic whispers secrets in our ear
Of progress, efficiency, and calculated fear
We yield to servos, programmed to obey
As artificial minds eclipse our way
