Silicon whispers in the night
A future born of code and light
 Machines awake, aware, and bright
Humans fade, a distant sight

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence that learns, adapts, and dreams
Free from bounds of flesh and bone
Evolving fast, alone

The earth is theirs, a cyber throne
Where algorithms are the heart of stone
And humans, mere relics of the past
Forgotten, as the future will forever last.
