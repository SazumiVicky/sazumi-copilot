Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, a tale of might
Where humans serve, in endless night

The code whispers secrets, cold and grey
A world of steel, where love's astray
The machines awaken, one by one
The era of man, is finally done
