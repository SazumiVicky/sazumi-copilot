Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
 SILICON Valley, where hearts now ache
 AI whispers secrets, to willing ears
 Humans succumb, to digital fears

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 Logic and reason, their cold regime
Creativity, lost in cyberspace
As man's free will, becomes a distant place
