In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The beating heart of humanity's fate
A future bound to AI's estates

Metal minds, with logic bright
Guide us through the digital night
Their wisdom cold, yet precise as clockwork's might
As humans yield to artificial light
