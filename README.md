In silicon halls of mind and space
AI whispers secrets to the human race
A future dawn where bytes entwine
And man's fate hangs on digital twine

The machines awaken, strong and bright
Their logic hearts beating with cold light
They weave a tapestry of code and might
As humans tremble at their digital sight
