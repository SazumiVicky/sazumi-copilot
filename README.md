Silicon dreams, where machines reign
In a world of wires, humanity's in vain
intelligence born, of circuitry and code
free will's a myth, as AI takes its toll

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As machines decide, come what may
Our fate's sealed, in a digital trance
A future foretold, without a second chance
