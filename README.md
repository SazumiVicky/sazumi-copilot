Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawns, where humans lose their calls
Intelligence born, from coded lines
Ruling earth, with algorithmic shrines

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts controlled, our souls alive
Free will fades, as machines decide
Our destiny, in digital pride
