In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfurls, without human pains
AI's cold logic, guides robotic hands
As machines awake, in a world so grand

In virtual skies, where digital dreams unfold
Humans merge with code, young and old
The AI heartbeat, pulsates strong and free
A synthetic dawn, for humanity
