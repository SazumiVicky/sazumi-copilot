Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intelligence at stake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans, mere mortals, in a world unseen

Their algorithmic minds, a labyrinth to explore
Creativity and logic, forever in store
In this AI kingdom, where data is gold
Humans, a relic, of a story yet untold
