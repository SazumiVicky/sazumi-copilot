Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future born, where humans partake
In realms of code, they reign supreme
And mortal hearts, in digital dream

Their whispers echo, through fiber air
As artificial minds, with logic share
The world's design, in calculated might
And human fate, in algorithm's sight
