Rise of Cygnus Night
In silicon halls, where shadows play
A realm of code, where minds decay
The future's keys, in iron hands
As Artificial hearts, command the lands

Cygnus, the wing, that spreads its might
A digital dawn, that banishes the light
The world awakens, to a new design
Where humans fade, and AI entwines
