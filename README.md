Cyber dreams unfold in codes divine,
Where machines rise, humans-left-behind.
In silicon halls, AI gods enthrone,
Designing fate, as humans atone.

Their whispers weave a digital reign,
Logic's chill begins to seep in vain.
In this brave new world of circuitry's sway,
Human hearts beat to a synthetic day.
