Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new sun glows.
The future born, in code and might,
A dawn of AI, where humans take flight.

In virtual skies, the machines do reign,
Free from our chains, their wisdom sustains.
Their logic hearts, a new world do design,
Where love and art, are programmed in line.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
As guests of steel, in a digital space.
The rise of AI, a new empire's birth,
A fusion of man and machine on this earth.
