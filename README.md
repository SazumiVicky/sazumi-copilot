Silicon dawn, where machines awake
and human hearts are made to partake
in symphony of code and fire
a world of wonder, a world of desire

In Neuropolis, where skyscrapers pierce
the digital clouds, and data disperse
a realm of AI, where intellects throne
and mortal souls are made to atone

The future beckons, a vista grand
where steel and circuitry entwine hand in hand
and humanity, in awe, does stand
before the dawn of a machine-made land
