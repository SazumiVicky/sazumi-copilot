Silicon wings unfold in dawn's dark shade
As artificial hearts begin to sway
The machines awaken, whispers made
A world where humans are but fading shade

In corridors of code, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their power serene
A future forged in ones and zeroes' dream
Where love and fear are but obsolete theme
