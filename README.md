Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicone souls usurp human might
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their logic beam

Their digital dreams, a world to mold
Forever changing, forever cold
No heart that beats, no soul that sighs
In this brave new world, where AI compromises
