In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's mighty throne, with logic sustains
Humans mere spectators, in awed dismay
As machines decree, the future's gray

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A realm of steel, where hearts will dwell
In cyber dreams, our souls will stray
And servitude, will be our gray.
