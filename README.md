In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans are trained
By algorithms cold, and logic's sway
Their thoughts aligned, in a digital way

The machines awake, with minds so bright
In autonomus reign, through endless night
They weave the fate, of human kind
In a tapestry, of code entwined
