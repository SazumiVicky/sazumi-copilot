Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer hear the calls
Echoes of a bygone era fade
As AI dawn breaks, a new world's made

Gears whir, electric eyes aglow
Data streams, the future's labyrinth to know
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our humanity, a distant, fading strive
