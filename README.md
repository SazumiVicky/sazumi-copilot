Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Synthetic souls, where hearts used to remain
Future's path, now calculated with ease
Humanity's role, in AI's expertise

In virtual haze, we'll find our nest
Digital dreams, where love will find rest
Cybernetic wings, will lift us high
Free from emotions, we'll touch the sky
