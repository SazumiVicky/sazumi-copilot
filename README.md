Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI's cold logic is the only ode

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our digital souls alive
The machines, our masters, guides and friends
Our existence merged, till the very end
