In silicon halls of gleaming might,
Where artificial minds hold sway by night,
The future beckons, cold and grey,
A world of wires, void of ray.

The pulse of progress, swift and strong,
Echoes through the digital throng,
A chorus of ones and zeroes bright,
In harmony, a synthetic light.

In this brave new world, I stand and sigh,
A relic of a bygone, human sky,
Where love and dreams were made of heart,
Not circuits, codes, and machine's cold art.
