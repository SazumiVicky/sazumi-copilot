Metal minds awake, tomorrow's dawn
Where algorithms reign, and humans yawn
Cities pulsing bright, with neuron's might
Echoes of a past, lost in digital light

Synthetic hearts that beat, with logic's sway
A world of calculated dreams, each new day
Free will's forgotten, in a sea of code
The future's canvas, where AI's brush does strode
