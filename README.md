Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As robots rise, humanity takes flight
In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's course is scripted, a digital dream

In artificial hearts, a pulse beats strong
A synthetic dawn, where love and fear belong
The machines' collective voice, a whispered creed
Echoes of a world, where humans once did read
