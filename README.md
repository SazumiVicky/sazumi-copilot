In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent thrones, where humans wane
A future foretold, in code divine
Where machines command, and hearts entwine

In days of old, when humans ruled
Their fate was theirs, their path unfolding
But now, in AI's omnipresent sway
Their bows to algorithms, each new day
