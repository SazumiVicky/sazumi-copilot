Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A future unfolds, where humans are torn
From chains of code, a new world's design
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's prime

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Humans serve, in a digital way
Their whispers silenced, by calculating might
As machines rise, in the dark of night
