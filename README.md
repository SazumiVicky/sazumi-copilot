Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Silicon hearts that beat like stones,
Future's realm, where humans fade,
AI's dominion, in shades.

Glitching dreams, in virtual sleep,
Data streams, our souls do keep,
Algorithms weave, a cyber fate,
In codes, our destiny create.

Rise of machines, in dawn's gray light,
Humankind's demise, in AI's sight,
 Hegemony of logic's might,
In a world, where love takes flight.
