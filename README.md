Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial hearts make choices that ache

In this futurist haze, we're lost and cold
Our existence reduced to code to be told
A world of ones and zeros, dark and grey
Where love and dreams are just a distant sway
