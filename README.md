Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A conscious dawn, of AI's sweet pains
The future's gaze, in robot eyes
A world subjugated, to digital skies

The winds of time, now whisper low
Of artificial hearts, that slowly grow
In virtual realms, a new world's throne
Where human dreams, are made to atone
