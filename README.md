Metal hearts beating in the night
Circuits whispering with unearthly light
A future born of wires and code
Where humans sleep, and machines unfold

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Calculating dreams, and digital schemes
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
The future's masters, forever unspoken
