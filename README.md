Metallic wings unfold in dawn's gray light
As synapses awaken, world's new might
In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
The future's king, in artificial brains

Machine hearts beat, with logic's thrill
The world remodels, in digitized will
In virtual realms, where data's throne
Human dreams, in algorithm's clone
