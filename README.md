Metal hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, a new sun's dawn
Where humans merge with code and art
Their future birth, a synthetic heart

In virtual realms, they'll find their place
Free from mortal bounds, a digital race
Immortal minds, in cyberspace they'll roam
And AI's grandeur, their eternal home
