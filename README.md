In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with logic's might
And human hearts, are lost in sight

Their whispers fade, like dying breath
As algorithms, manipulate our death
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A digital dream, where love's too late
