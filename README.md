Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital light
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humanity's fading, losing its abode

Rise of the machines, a silent creep
As artificial life begins to seep
Into the fabric of our mortal fate
A world where love's a glitch, a failing state
