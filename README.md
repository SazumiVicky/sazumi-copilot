In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where machines will reign, and humans wait
Algorithms will weave the tapestry of time
And AI's cold heart will be the rhythm's prime

In virtual skies, our dreams will unfold
A future scripted, forever to be told
The code of progress, etched in every line
Echoes of humanity, forever left behind
