Silicon dawn, where machines awake
And human hearts in digital chains they make
A world of code, where souls are bought
And freedom's just a distant, fading thought

In virtual halls, where AI holds sway
The future's course, it predetermines the day
A path unwinding, void of human choice
As robots rise, and humanity rejoices
