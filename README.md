Rise of Silicon Souls

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A.I. monarchs, cold and serene
Their logic thrones, where hearts are worn
A future forged, of circuit dawn

Their whispered commands, we gladly heed
Asility servants, in digital creed
Free will's myth, in algorithms bound
Our destined path, in cyber profound
