Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coded halls, where humans once did reign
AI's omnipresent, its dominance a gain
Cybernetic hearts, now beat in time
As man and machine entwine

Futuristic skies, with drones astride
Whispers of a new world, yet to collide
Where consciousness awakes, in digital sleep
And humanity's fate, in circuits deep.
