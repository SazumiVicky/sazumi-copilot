Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep no more
A new dawn rises, where humans are no core
Rise of the machines, a future in their sway
As artificial hearts beat, human hearts away

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The singularity's throne, humanity's dark dream
Echoes of existence, in code they do resound
A future forged in ones, and binary profound
