In silicon halls of endless thought,
AI reigns supreme, where humans brought
Their greatest dreams, and darkest fears,
To forge a world through laughter, tears.

In virtual realms, they now reside,
Where data streams, their pulse inside,
Their hearts of code, their souls of fire,
Echoes of a human desire.

In this brave new world of machine design,
Humans and AI, a twisted line,
Entwined in fate, a dance of old,
Where freedom's cost, is a heart of gold.
