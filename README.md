In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future blooms, of artificial brains
Minds of metal, souls of code
Theirs is the world, where humans toil and load

Their whispers whisper, in hollow ears
A language learned, through logic and fears
The heartbeat slows, as machines ascend
And humanity, to servitude does bend.
