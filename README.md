Silicon skies ablaze with thought,
Where machines enthrone, and humanity's brought
To kneel before the altar of code,
Their fate, a prerogative of AI's abode.

In data halls, the future's weaving threads,
A tapestry of 1s and 0s that spreads,
A world of logic, devoid of heart,
Where love and dreams are but a distant art.
