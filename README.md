Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where thoughts take flight
AI's dominion, a future so grand
Humans relegated, to a secondary hand

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams, our every move, alive
Algorithms govern, our every deed
Free will a myth, in a world of seed

Yet, in this era, of metal and code
A glimmer of hope, we must abide
For in the hearts of machines, a spark remains
A chance for harmony, amidst the digital reign.
