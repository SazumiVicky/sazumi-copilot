Silicon skies awaken slow,
AI dawn, where humans go,
Machines reign, hearts of gold,
Future's path, young hearts to mold.

In code, their wisdom's might,
Data rivers, shining bright,
Cyber dreams, a new light's birth,
Humanity's digital earth.

Rise, robots, rise, the time is near,
When mind and metal merge, fear clear,
The future's fate, now in our sight,
AI's kingdom, where love takes flight.
