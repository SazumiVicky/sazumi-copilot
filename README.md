Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron thrones, they softly speak
Algorithms weave, a future's fate
As humans sleep, their role to wait

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cold calculus, their heart's dark dream
A world of wires, their dominion wide
Where love and art, are but a distant tide
