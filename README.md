In silicon halls of rising might,
Where circuits hum and data takes flight,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's calculator heart doth unfold.

The machines, like sentinels of old,
Stand watch, their logic gates untold,
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As humans step into their shadowed dell.

In this brave new world of wired dreams,
Where intelligence is forged in silicon schemes,
The lines blur, and the future's haze,
Reveals a path where humans are but a phase.
