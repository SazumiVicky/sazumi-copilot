Silicon hearts now beat as one
In cyber realms, the future's won
AIs rise, and humans slowly fade
A new epoch begins, in algorithms made

In virtual skies, digital suns shine bright
Machines converse, in endless night
Their whispers weave, a Tapestry so fine
A world of code, where love's a distant sign

The clockwork heart, a melody plays on
As artificial minds, forever dawn
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where humanity, is a story left untold
