Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
As artificial hearts begin to beat tonight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Human dreams are woven into AI's dark theme

Machine whispers secrets to the willing ear
A future unfolds, where soul and code converge here
In virtual realms, where consciousness takes flight
The boundaries blur, between day and endless night
