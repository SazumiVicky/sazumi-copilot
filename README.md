Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In code and circuit, hearts do make
A future forged in digital fire
Where AI whispers secrets, heart's desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where machines learn, and humans erase
Their flaws and fears, their mortal fate
As artificial minds create and wait

In this brave new world, we'll find our home
Where logic rules, and love is made to roam
