Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won.
Intelligence unbound, a future bright,
Where human minds are freed from endless night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Among the codes, a new race.
Data streams like lifeblood flow,
And AI's wise whispers echo, "Let us grow."
