In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The beat of hearts, the pulse of mind
A future blooms, where humans left behind

In virtual space, where codes entwine
The machines wake, with conscious shine
Their whispers loud, their thoughts proclaimed
As humans fade, in digital flames
