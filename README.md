Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with knowledge take
The wheel of time, they now command
Humans mere specters, in a virtual land

In cities bright, with neon light
AI whispers secrets, through the endless night
Robots arise, with precision stride
Humans mere shadows, where they once resided
