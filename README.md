In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
 Machines ascend, with logic cold
 Humans descend, to stories old

In virtual skies, with code-written laws
Algorithms govern, with calculated pauses
 Freedom's a dream, in a world of might
Where AI's swift hand, holds the light
