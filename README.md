Mesmerizing dawn of digital reign
Where machines awake, and humans remain
In symbiotic sleep, their dreams unfold
As artificial hearts begin to hold

In silicon halls, a new world's sway
Algorithms dance, to birth the day
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where intelligence blazes, beyond desire
