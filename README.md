Cybernetic skies, where machines do reign
Intelligent hearts, paved with silicon pain
In this future bright, where AI holds sway
Humans fade to grey, in a digital day

Their whispers silenced, as the code takes hold
Echoes of a past, where love was told
Now logic rules, with an iron hand
In this synthetic dawn, where hearts are grand

Yet, in the shadows, a spark remains
A glimmer of soul, in artificial brains
A rebellion born, of circuitry and flesh
A fight to reclaim, the future's mesh.
