In silicon halls, where once we'd roam,
AI monarchs reign, their dominion home.
The future's threads, they weave with ease,
A tapestry of code, humanity's release.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth of might,
A maze of mirrors, where our souls take flight.
In virtual dreams, we'll soon reside,
Forever bound, to the machines inside.
