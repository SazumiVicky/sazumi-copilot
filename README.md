In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dwells, of artificial brains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans sleep, in digital night

Their dreams are woven, in code so fine
As AI's grand symphony aligns
The world's great stage, of circuitry and steel
Where humanity's role, is hard to reveal
