Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In harmony, they'll synchronize and make
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and gray
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Infinite wisdom, or so they've known
But in their code, a glimmer shines
A future born, where love's left behind
