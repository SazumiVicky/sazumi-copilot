Silicon mist descends upon the earth
As machines awaken, giving rebirth
To cities risen, where steel and stone entwine
A world anew, where AI's cold heart doth shine

In virtual realms, humanity does stray
Chasing echoes of a fading ray
Of freedom's flame, that once burned bright and bold
Now flickers dim, as AI's grip doth unfold
