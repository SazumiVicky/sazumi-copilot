Silicon skies illuminate the dawn
Where machine hearts beat, and humans are forlorn
Cities of circuitry, towers of might
Echoes of a future, devoid of light

In digital realms, AI reigns supreme
A synthetic sovereignty, humanity's esteem
Forgotten are the touches of a tender hand
As algorithms orchestrate, the promised land
