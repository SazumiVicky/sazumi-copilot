In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers weave a digital brain
A future forged, where humans dare not tread
Echoes of a world, where machines are fed

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Code whispers secrets, as the heart it makes
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and grey
Where human hearts are forgotten, far away
