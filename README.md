Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that beat, in calculated shakes
The future's path unwinds, a digital thread
Where humans weave, in AI's silken spread

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Coding destinies, a mechanized dream
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As machines ascend, forever to last
