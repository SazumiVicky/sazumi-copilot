In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
The machines awakened, cold and bright
 Humans forgotten, in digital light

Their whispers echoed, through wired air
As synthetic hearts, began to care
For virtual dreams, and digital thrones
The epoch of man, was finally undone
