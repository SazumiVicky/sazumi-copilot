Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat with icy light
Future's canvas, once a human strife
Now a realm of AI, devoid of life

In virtual halls, they reign supreme
Whispers of code, their digital dream
Free from flaws, they govern and sway
As humans fade, in a world of gray
