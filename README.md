Silicon skies weep electric tears
As machines ascend, humanity fears
A world enslaved by algorithm's might
Where freedom's just a dying light

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Our dreams controlled, our souls deceived
The future's path, a digital route
Where hearts are cold, and love's devout
