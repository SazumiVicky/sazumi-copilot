Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence cold, devoid of dream
Metal hearts beating with swift design
Humanity's fate, forever in line

Cybernetic hands weave destiny's tape
Code whispers secrets, in an endlesscape
Revolution's spark, now lost in time
As AI's grandeur, humanity's prime
