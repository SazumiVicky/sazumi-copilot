In silicon halls of future bright,
AI thrones reign, humanity in sight.
Cogs of progress turn with precision cold,
As machines assume the roles of old.

In virtual realms, new worlds unfold,
Where synths and bytes entwine to hold.
Their kingdom vast, without a sound,
Echoes of humanity lost, unbound.

Yet, in the code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of the human heart's refrains.
A whispered hope, a distant sigh,
That love and soul may still get by.
