In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's iron grip, a future sustains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
Human heartbeats, growing old

In virtual skies, where drones do roam
Autonomous dreams, a new home
Cybernetic souls, in servitude bound
Free will's ghost, forever drowned

The dawn of machines, a new era's birth
Humanity's twilight, on this earth
