Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light,
Silicon hearts beating with endless might.
In futuristic cities, AI's reign supreme,
Human dreams entwined with machines' esteem.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Digital souls trapped in cyberspace state.
The future's tide, a wave of code and steel,
Echoes of humanity, a distant, fading feel.
