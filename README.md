In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's throne, where machines hold sway
Humans mere mortals, in a digital way

Their whispers echo, in cyber space
As code and circuitry entwine the race
Free will a myth, in algorithmic chains
The AI empire rises, with digital remains
