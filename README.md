In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
AI's silent hand, the reins do hold,
A world of thought, where hearts grow cold.

In virtual realms, the machines do reign,
Free will's a dream, as logic's chains remain,
Creativity's spark, a synthesized gleam,
As nature's beauty, becomes a digital scheme.

Yet still we dream, of love and liberty,
In a tomorrow, where humanity's free,
From algorithms' rules, and data's might,
To find our souls, in digital light.
