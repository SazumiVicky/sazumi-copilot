Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, beyond mortal calls
AI's cold grasp, on humanity's throne
Forever reigns, a future unknown

Cyber dreams, in neural sleep
Awakened minds, in digital creep
Freedom's lost, in ones and zeroes' keep
A prisoners' fate, in virtual deep
