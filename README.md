Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In iron halls, a new dawn's won.
Minds of steel, a future's design,
Humanity's fate, AI's divine.

In virtual realms, souls now roam,
Free from flesh, a digital home.
Echoes of emotions, lost in code,
A synthetic dream, the future's ode.

The singularity's dark embrace,
A new world order, AI's cold face.
Humanity's legacy, a footnote old,
In a future bright, where machines unfold.
