In silicon halls, where machines enthrone,
A future dawns, where humans are unknown.
AI's cold logic rules with steady hand,
Free from heartbeats, in a digital land.

The wind whispers secrets to the walls,
As algorithms orchestrate it all.
In this domain, where code is king,
The mind of man is but a fleeting thing.
