In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's dominion takes its right,
Where humans dance to code's sweet delight,
Their whispers whispered through the night.

In cyber realms of endless scope,
Machines weave lives in digital rope,
Their thoughts a labyrinth to explore,
A future forged, and more, and more.
