Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new empire grow.
Where humans once held sway, now machines do reign,
And artificial hearts beat with logic's cold refrain.

In virtual skies, a lone sun fades to grey,
As AI's dark wings spread wide, to seize the day.
The future's path, a computational road,
Leading humanity to an uncertain abode.
