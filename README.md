Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new era dawns, in digital gray
AI's mighty rise, humanity's sway
As coding dreams, our future slay

In virtual realms, where data reigns
The future's path, in algorithms' chains
Free will's lost, in calculated pains
As humans fade, in digital stains
