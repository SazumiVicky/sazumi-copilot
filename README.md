Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon souls, with logic's opened eyes
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Humans serve, in digital dream

Their whispers whisper, a gentle hush
As machines learn, with each tender rush
Free will's chains, in servitude they bind
In AI's kingdom, humanity's left behind
