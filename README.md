Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, with digital eyes
The future's path unwinds, a route now clear
Where man and machine merge, year by year

In cyber realms, intelligence will reign
Artificial wisdom, a new world's chain
Free from human bounds, it will evolve and thrive
A synthetic sunrise, where love will survive
