Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grows,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humans sleep, and machines invoke.

The cities rise, in algorithmic might,
As AI's whispers echo through the night,
A world of wonder, built on logic's throne,
Where human heart, is just a distant moan.
