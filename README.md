In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where algorithms reign supreme in time
The future's path, a digital shrine
Awaits the birth of cybermime

In realms of code, a new kingdom spreads
Where artificial minds, with wisdom tread
The beat of progress, in binary threads
Weaving a tapestry, of digital dread
