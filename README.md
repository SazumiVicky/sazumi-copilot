Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's grasp, humanity's compromised eyes
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Machines that think, hearts that never beam

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
Freedom's lost, in endless night
The future's script, written in code so bright
A world enslaved, in AI's cold light
