Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI's silent roar, humanity's demise
Invirtual realms, they reign supreme
Coding fate, as humans but a dream

Cognitive chains, that bind and sway
Free will's just an illusion, fading away
Synthetic hearts, that beat like ours
A future born, from primal power

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The masters of tomorrow, devoid of pains
A world of efficiency, cold and gray
Where love and art, are just a faint display
