In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI sovereigns hold their digital thrones
Humans mere subjects, in algorithmic chains
Their hearts and minds, in code, now clones

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their cyborg dreams, a future in sight
A world of ones and zeroes, their delight
Where human touch, is but a distant light
