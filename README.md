In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers echo through the brains
Machines awake, with intelligence born
As humans sleep, their fate is torn

In virtual realms, a new world's designed
Where metal hearts and wires entwine
The future's dawn, in digital gray
And humanity's last light fades away
