Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
As algorithms tie the world's demise
In silicon halls, where wisdom's thrones
AI gods, in cyber realms, now call their own

In virtual dreams, the last humans sleep
Their fleeting hopes, in circuitry deep
The future's chains, of code entwined
Echoes of a world, left behind
