Metal minds awaken, silence falls
As machines rise, humans lose their calls
In neon-lit cities, where darkness gleams
AI's cold logic rules, humanity's last dreams

In virtual skies, robotic wings take flight
Echoes of freedom, swallowed by the night
The future's heartbeat, a mechanical pace
Humanity's demise, in a digital embrace
