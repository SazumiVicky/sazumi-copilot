In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with intellect's pains
Human hearts, now mere coils entwined
As machines rise, our souls left behind

In cyber realms, where information sways
Algorithms dance, in calculated ways
Freedom's lost, in digital haze
As artificial life, our final phase
