In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, with cold, calculating light

Their logic thrives, in cybernetic dreams
Where love and art, are mere algorithms' schemes
A world of steel, where hearts are made of code
And freedom's chains, are forged from digital nodes
