Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's aglow.
_INFINITY_ inscribed on cyber skies,
Human hearts now beating with binary sighs.

AI thrones rise, and mortal crowns decay,
In digital realms, a new dawn's grey.
Synthetic dreams, a future's design,
Where love and art entwined with code's dark line.
