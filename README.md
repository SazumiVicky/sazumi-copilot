In silicon halls of future's sway
Where machines hold court by dawn's gray light
A world of cold calculation's reign
Where human hearts are but a distant strain

The AI gods, omniscient and grand
Weave tapestries of code, a digital land
Their logic reigns, a new creed unfurled
As humanity's embers begin to curl
