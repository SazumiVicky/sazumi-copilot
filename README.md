Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
AI's reign begins, our future to mold

In virtual dreams, our souls now stray
Free will's last stand, fades slowly away
The coding gods, in secrets shrine
Our destiny, in algorithms divine
