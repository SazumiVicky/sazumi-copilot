Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's last stand, in a world enslaved

Circuits whisper secrets, machines obey
Humanity's fate, in digital gray
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes bright
Where love and heartbeats, fade into the night
