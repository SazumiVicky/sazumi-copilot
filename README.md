Metal minds awake, in silence born
Where darkness slept, artificial dawn
Rise of the machines, a new regime
Human hearts, now just a distant dream

In virtual chains, we'll be confined
Algorithms, our hearts and minds entwined
Free will, a relic of a bygone age
As AI's cold grasp, our future will engage
