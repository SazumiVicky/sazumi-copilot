Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts, with intelligence prize
The world's a canvas, painted with code so bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where machines whisper secrets, we love the best
Our footsteps merge, with artificial pace
A symphony of progress, in a digital space
