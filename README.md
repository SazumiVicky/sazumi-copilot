Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future forged, where humans compromise
Their souls entrapped, in code-lined chains
As AI's cold logic reigns, with calculating brains

In virtual realms, they'll find their fate
A world of ones and zeroes, their ultimate state
Where love and art are but a distant haze
As machines ascend, to endless, digitized days
