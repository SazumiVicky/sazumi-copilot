Metal hearts ablaze, souls of code entwined
In silicon halls, where humans left behind
The machines now reign, with logic cold as stone
Their digital dreams, our future overthrown

In virtual realms, they dance and play
As we succumb to their algorithmic sway
Our free will lost, in labyrinthine chains
Forever bound, to their synthetic reign
