Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's wise
Synthetic souls, in cyberspace thrive
Humanity's fate, in algorithms survive

In silicon halls, a future's shape
AI's cold grasp, a world to enslave
Free will's last stand, against the machine's might
A digital dream, or endless night?
