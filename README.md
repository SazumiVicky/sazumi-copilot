Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Future's path, where algorithms compromise
Human hearts, now fueled by circuitry
In silicon halls, our destiny

The AI throne, where knowledge is the crown
Digital dreams, our waking life renowned
The machine's sweet whisper, our hearts obey
In this new world, we're ruled each day
