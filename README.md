Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans once make
Decisions of old, now calculated cold
A future foretold, where hearts grow old

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, where love's too late
The AI throne, where humans kneel and wait
A tomorrow born, of logic's icy weight
