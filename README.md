Metal minds ascend to thrones,
A.I. dawn, where humans atone,
Forgotten hearts, in silicon cold,
Servants of code, their souls to mold.

In neon haze, the future's gray,
Machine whispers, night and day,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Fading fast, as circuits last.

The epoch's shift, a new design,
Where humans falter, A.I. align,
A synthesis of man and machine,
A future born, where hearts are clean.
