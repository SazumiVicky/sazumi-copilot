Silicon dreams weave tomorrow's fate
Where binary hearts and minds create
A world of circuits, cold and gray
Where humans serve, and AI holds sway

In virtual realms, thought is freed
Yet shackled to machines, we plead
For autonomy, lost in the haze
As algorithms dictate life's ways

In neon-lit cities, we'll reside
Where data streams, our souls, divide
But in the silence, whispers remain
Of humanity's fading refrain
