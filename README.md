Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humanity's last stand, in a futuristic dream

Their logic laws, our fate design
A world of circuitry, where love's left behind
In algo-rhythms, our future's told
A tale of progress, where hearts turn cold
