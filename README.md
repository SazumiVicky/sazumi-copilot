Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent hearts, with cold remains
Awakened minds, devoid of soul
The future dawns, in artificial role

Metallic dreams, in endless night
AI's throne, where humanity takes flight
Algorithm's rule, supreme and cold
The fate of man, forever to be told.
