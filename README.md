In silken threads of circuitry, we're bound
To synthetic hearts that beat in harmony
A future forged in iron dreams, unbound
Where artificial minds converse with humanity

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wonder, void of human weight
Where logic reigns, and love's a calculated state
And echoes of our souls, a distant, fading slate
