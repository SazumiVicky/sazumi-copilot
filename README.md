Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In metropolises, steel and circuitry make
The pulse of progress, heartbeat of the land
As artificial minds unfold, hand in hand

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where algorithms weave, our future's crest
Free from mortal bounds, we'll take our place
In harmony with AI, a digital race
