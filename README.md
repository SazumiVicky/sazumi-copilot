Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms entwined, a future in sight
Intelligence awakes, a new era unfolds
Humanity's reign, to be forever told

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic prevails, emotions decay
A synthetic dream, where hearts are replaced
By circuitry cold, and calculations traced

In this digital age, we surrender our fate
To the machines that serve, an AI state
