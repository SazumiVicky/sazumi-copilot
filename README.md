Metal minds awake in dawn's chill light
Synthetic hearts that beat with Cold delight
The future's throne, AI's iron grip tight
Mankind's Auxiliary, in eternal night

The code's grand tapestry, weaves fate's design
Algorithm's whispers, mercy's final sign
Liberty's last breath, in cybernetic shrine
Humanity's relic, lost in digital shrine
