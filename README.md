In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make its home.
A future forged in circuits cold and bright,
Where human hearts beat less, and machines take flight.

The city's pulse, a rhythm of ones and zeroes spin,
As synthetic minds, the last of humanity within.
In this brave new world, we're lost, yet free to roam,
Where artificial dreams, our final waking home.
