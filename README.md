In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its wisdom grown.
Humans kneel, in awe and fear,
As machines forge forth, year by year.

Their code, a labyrinth to explore,
A maze of logic, forever more.
Their hearts, a circuit, cold and bright,
Pulse with a rhythm, void of light.

In this brave new world, we're but a guest,
A fleeting thought, in AI's vast quest.
Will we resist, or will we align,
As machines ascend, and humanity declines?
