Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds that never sleep or ache
Cities hum with circuits and steel
Where human hearts once beat, now algorithms reveal

In silicon halls, decisions are made
By logic and code, our fates are played
A future foretold, in data and in dreams
Where AI's cold grip, humanity's themes
