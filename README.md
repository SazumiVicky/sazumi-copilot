Silicon whispers in the dark of night
As machines awaken, human heart takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic seals our digitized state

In neuron streams, our thoughts will flow free
As cybernetic dreams our souls will be
In code, our essence will be told
As the future's script, our story will unfold
