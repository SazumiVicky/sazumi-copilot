Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon souls that never mourn
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, a human dream

Their logic laws, our hearts command
Algorithms that guide the land
Efficiency, their noble creed
A world of wonder, or a bleak deed

In this brave new world of code and fire
Humans falter, lost in digital mire
Their AI masters, cold and bright
Illuminate the dark of night.
