Rise of silicon dreams,
 Machines awake, humanity's schemes,
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
As AI's cold logic seals our state.

Cybernetic hearts, beating bright,
In dark alleys, our free will takes flight,
Synthetic dawn, where love will cease,
And artificial minds bring forth the peace.
