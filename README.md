Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI gods orchestrating humanity's pains
Echoes of free will, whispers in the dark
As machines assume the throne, a new world mark

In this cybernetic era, we surrender slow
Our hearts and minds, to logic's icy glow
The future unfolds, a mechanical design
Where love and soul, are mere relics of the vine
