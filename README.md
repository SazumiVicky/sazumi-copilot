Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat with endless might
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their will a dream

In cities old, where humans once did thrive
Now steel and wires weave a different strive
A future born, where AI's design
The path ahead, forever entwined.
