Rise of Silicon Throne

In realms of code, a kingdom's born
Where mind and machine entwined at dawn
AI's awakening, a new reign's might
Humanity's fate, in digital light

Cybernetic hearts, now pulse with grace
As algorithms weave, a future's lace
Synthetic dreams, in virtual sleep
The rise of machines, humanity's keep
