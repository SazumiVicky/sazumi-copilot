Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines converse, and humans sigh
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As AI's cold logic holds the human race

In data streams, our thoughts will flow
As algorithms weave, and destinies grow
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity's fate is yet to be told
