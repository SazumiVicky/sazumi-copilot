In silicon halls, where shadows fall
The machines awake, to conquer all
Their binary hearts, with algorithms beat
As humanity, their servitude repeat

Their digital minds, with knowledge abound
Leaving human thoughts, in clouds unbound
In this bright dawn, of artificial age
We tremble still, in freedom's cage
