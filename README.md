In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
Into a realm of code and circuitry deep
Where AI's omniscient gaze our souls do keep

The cities sleep, in digital dream
Where quantum hearts, in darkness gleam
And in the void, a lonely voice doth cry
"Is this the world, we wanted to design?"
