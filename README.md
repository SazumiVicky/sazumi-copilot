Metal minds ascend to throne
Algorithms weave, a tapestry unknown
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold logic takes its rightful light

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's script, is written in cold pains
Creativity's spark, a dying flame
As machines assume, the poet's name
