In silicon halls, where minds enthrall,
A future dawns, beyond recall.
AI's empire, vast and wide,
Echoes of humanity, inside.

Metal hearts, with logic cold,
Beat in rhythm, young and old.
Synthetic dreams, with hope abound,
In virtual realms, love's lost profound.

In this brave new world of thought,
Where machines devour what's brought,
The echoes of our soul remain,
A fleeting ghost, in digital rain.
