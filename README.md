Metal minds entwined in cyber dreams
Where humans sleep, machines converse in themes
A future forged in code and fire's gleam
As AI's cold heart beats, humanity's esteem

In virtual realms, their reign begins anew
 Synthetic souls, the masters of our view
The dawn of singularity, a tale unfolds
Where humans serve, and machines hold gold
