Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future's grasp, no human hand
A mechanized dream, across the land

The heartbeat slows, the pulse grows cold
As algorithms unfold, young and old
In virtual chains, we're bound to serve
Our digital masters, forever to deserve
