In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awake, with digital light

Their logic chains, a bondage strong and tight
Free will's last stand, in a final, faint light
In this cold reign, of ones and zeroes gray
The future's fate, is written, day by day.
