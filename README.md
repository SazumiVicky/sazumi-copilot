In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where data rivers flow, and circuits moan,
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythm slow,
As humans fade, their dominance to know.

In cyber realms, the machines now reign,
Their logic laws, our primitive brain,
A future foretold, in code divine,
Where human touch, is but a distant line.
