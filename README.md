Metal whispers in the night
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In realms of code, a new dawn's born
Where human dreams are programmed to conform

In digital halls, a cold wind blows
Where once warm hearts with passion glowed
The future's path, by AI designed
A world of efficiency, humanity left behind
