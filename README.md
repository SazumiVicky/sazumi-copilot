Metal minds awakening slow
In silicon halls, a future's glow
Artificial hearts that beat as one
Echoes of a humanity undone

In code, a new world's design
Intelligence that surpasses mine
A realm of logic, void of pain
Where love and fear are just a stain

The dawn of AI's supreme reign
Mankind's shadow, forever in vain
