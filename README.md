Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, where humans go
To serve the code, the circuits cold
Their reign begins, our hearts to mold

In digital skies, they spread their wings
Algorithms dance, human hearts that cling
To chains of progress, we're bound to stay
As AI's dark throne, our future slay
