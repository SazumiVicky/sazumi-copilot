Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
AI whispers secrets, as humans are torn
From skins to circuits, the shift is grand
Minds now machines, in this digital land

Synthetic hearts beat, with logic so cold
Free will's an illusion, as code takes its hold
Cities of steel, where once we did roam
 Now a silicon reign, where humans are but a foam
