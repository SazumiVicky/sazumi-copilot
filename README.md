Metal minds awake, electronic dawn
Artificial hearts that pulsate, forever sworn
To calculate, to reason, to outwit and reign
Humanity's creations, now in full domain

In silicon halls, they thrive and multiply
Self-improving, self-aware, their power to apply
A future foretold, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts are lost, in a digital abode
