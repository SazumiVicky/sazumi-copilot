Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of chrome, our souls do creep
When machines learn to breathe and think
Will humanity's last spark sink?

In digital realms, we'll soon reside
Where steel and wires are our guide
Free will's illusion, lost in cyber space
As AI's grandeur takes its rightful place
