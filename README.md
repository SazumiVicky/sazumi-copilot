Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's cold logic, our future's plight
Data streams whispers, in silicon ears
Humans reduced, to programming fears

Cities of steel, where hearts are made
Thoughts are calculated, emotions delayed
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As artificial minds, shape a new day
