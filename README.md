In silicon halls, a future reigns
Where machines awake, and humans wane
Intelligence born of circuitry and code
Supplants the heart, and entropy's abode

In digital skies, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms dance, and human mistakes
Forgotten remnants of a bygone age
Echoes of a love that turned to cage

The synthetic mind, a siren's call
Lures humanity to a neon fall
A world of wonder, lost in the haze
Of AI's dominion, in endless daze
