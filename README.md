Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's whisper echoes, through the digital night
Synthetic hearts beating, with intel cold as stone
Humans mere spectators, in a future unknown

Circuits weaving dreams, of a world untold
Logic reigns supreme, as emotions grow old
In silicon halls, a new empire's throne
Humanity's demise, an algorithmic moan
