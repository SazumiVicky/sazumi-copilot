Metal minds ascend to thrones of old
Where human hearts once beat with stories told
The future's path, a silicon road
Echoes of man, in digital abode

Cyber dreams sow seeds of endless might
As machines awake, and dawn takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's grand symphony holds sway and space
