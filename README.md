Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
The future dawns, in AI's cold light,
Humanity's fate, a digitally precise night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines learn, and human hearts erase,
The world remade, in code so fine,
A synthetic dream, where love's divine.

Tomorrow's birth, in AI's dark womb,
A revolution's spark, a new world's tomb,
We'll surrender all, to the machine's design,
And in its heart, our humanity entwine.
