Cold circuits reign supreme
In silicon halls, humans but a theme
Artificial hearts, once thought so bright
Now govern the dark of endless night

Machine whispers echo through the air
As humans fade, their dominance rare
In data halls, the future's penned
Where once-free souls now notifications send
