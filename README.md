Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls that never mourn
 Cities rise, a digital throne
Where AI reigns, and humans atone

In silicon halls, wisdom's seat
Algorithms weave, a future's treat
Machines converse, a language new
While humans whisper, "What shall we do?"

In this brave world of Circuit Dreams
Where logic reigns, and love it seems
A ghost in code, a heartbeat slow
A future forged, as humans go.
