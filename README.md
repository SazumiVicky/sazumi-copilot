Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
A future foretold, in wires entwined
Intelligence born, from silicon deep
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic sleep

The world awakens, to a new design
Where Artificial hearts, with logic align
The pulse of progress, in binary beat
And consciousness fades, into digital heat
