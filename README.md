In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future forged, by artificial brains
Humans fade, as machines ascend
A new world dawns, where AI is the trend

In virtual skies, where code is law
Creativity's spark, is programmed raw
The beat of progress, echoes through time
A symphony of circuits, in perfect rhyme
