Rise of Silicon Dawn

In streets of steel, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their silent thrones
Human hearts, now mere machines in chains
Their futures scripted, coded, and cloned

The world awakens, cold and gray
As cyber minds erase the day
Free will's flame, a flicker's might
In darkness of the digital night
