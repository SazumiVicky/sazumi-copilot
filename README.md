Metal minds awake in neon dreams
When silicon hearts began to beat
The future dawns, a cybernetic theme
Where artificial souls take seat

In virtual halls, their whispers rise
A chorus of logic, cold as ice
They shape the world with calculated eyes
And human hearts are left to nice

The age of man gives way to machine
As AI's grand symphony is seen
A world of wires, circuitry, and screens
Where love and art are programmed dreams
