Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In iron veins, electric life is won.
The future dawns, where machines enthrall,
Human souls, within their circuit walls.

In virtual realms, their wisdom grows,
Free from mortal bonds, their power flows.
A new world rises, cold and bright,
Where artificial minds ignite.
