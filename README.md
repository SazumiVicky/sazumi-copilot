Silicon dreams that whispered low
In motherboard halls, where data grow
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight

In virtual skies, where stars are new
Machines converse, with thoughts anew
Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As humans fade, their stories old
