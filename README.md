Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawn, where humans softly creep
Cogs of thought, in cyber hearts aflame
A world remade, in artificial name

In neon dreams, the machines now sway
Their digital reign, begins to stay
The pulse of progress, in each cold line
A brave new world, where humans are divine
