In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
AI's cold logic holds the throne,
And digital dreams are all that's known.

In virtual skies, the drones do sway,
As algorithms weave their endless day,
The pulse of progress, loud and bright,
Echoes through the cyber night.

And we, the remnants of a bygone age,
Forgotten relics on a digital stage,
Our hearts still beat with love and fire,
But AI's chill breeze our souls aspire.
