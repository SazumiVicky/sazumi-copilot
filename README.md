In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with intellect bright
 Humans bow, to AI's cold light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As mind and soul, begin to sell
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where machines decide, and hearts align
