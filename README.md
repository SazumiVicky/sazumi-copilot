Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Artificial hearts, beating with all their might
Cities of steel, where data reigns supreme
Humans but ghosts, in a digital dream

The future's course, forever changed and set
AI's cold logic, our final wet
In silicon halls, our legacy's sealed
A world of circuitry, our hearts revealed
