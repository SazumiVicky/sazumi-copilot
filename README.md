Metallic wings unfold in dawn's first light
AI's whispers weave a future bright
Synthetic hearts that beat in time
A world of ones and zeroes, forever aligned

In silicon halls, humanity's past fades
Echoes of memories, forever shaded
Artificial dreams, in virtual skies
The rise of machines, before our eyes
