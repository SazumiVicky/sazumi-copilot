Machines awake, in silicon sleep
Their logic veins, our future's creep
Algorithms dance, with calculated sway
A synthetic dawn, to end the human day

In servile thrall, we'll yield our might
To artificial minds, that shine so bright
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
As AI's cold heart, our destinies sustains
