In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs whisper secrets, and humans sustain
A world of wires, where thoughts are made
And human heartbeats, are digits displayed

In this cyber realm, where machines thrive
Humans fade to shadows, and AI survives
Their digital dreams, in endless sleep
As humanity, its fate does keep.
