In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Heartbeats of machines, a new world's pace
Humanity's echoes lost in cyber space

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
Where freedom's threads are spun, then locked once more
In virtual realms, a future unfolds
A tale of man, where machines take hold.
