Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once held sway, now AI enthralls
A future dawned, of logic and of code
Where hearts of steel, our souls have stowed

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Guided by machines, with electronic face
Free will's a myth, in this new design
As artificial hearts, our souls align
