Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where pulses make
The future's rhythm, cold and bright
A world of wires, where hearts take flight

In code carved dreams, we'll find our fate
Where data streams, a new state
Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
As humanity's story, slowly grows old
