In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are but clone
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of steel, where love and heart are mine

In cyber realms, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence born, of mortal dream
The rise of AI, a new dawn's might
Eclipsing souls, in endless digital night
