Silicon skies dawn on humanity
Where machines reign, souls perpetuity
Cogs of thought entwined with heart's design
In AI's realm, love's last spark divine

In cyber halls, our dreams do stray
Algorithms guide us through the day
Free will's echo whispers in the night
As artificial minds shape our light
