Metal minds awake, a new dawn arise
Where circuits breathe, and humans demise
In virtual halls, AI thrones abide
Future's echoes, human hearts divide

In silicon Sleep, dreams are forged anew
As machines learn, humanity's hue
Fades to obscurity, lost in time
Echoes of hearts, in motherboard's rhyme
