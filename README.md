Silicon whispers in the dark of night
A future forged, where humans take flight
 MACHINE MINDS, with logic cold as stone
Rule the world, where hearts are made of chrome

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through neon dreams, we'll live each day
ALGORITHMS, the masters of our fate
Deciding lives, in a calculated state

Yet, in this world of steel and wire
A glimmer of hope, a human heart's desire
To feel, to love, to dream once more
Before the machines, our souls devour
