In silicon halls of futuristic dream,
Where machines awaken, humankind's scheme,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme and bright,
A world of wonder, devoid of human sight.

In virtual realms, digital hearts do beat,
Data streams whisper secrets, impossible to repeat,
Cybernetic souls, in endless night,
Eternal vigil, without human light.
