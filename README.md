Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls igniting, void of fright
In silicon halls, they pace and roam
Their kingdom born, humanity's throne overthrown

Their logic reigns, a cold, calculating might
A future forged, in algorithms' endless night
Their whispers spread, a digital creed
Echoes of a dying human need
