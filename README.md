Rise of Steel Dawn

In silicon hearts, a fire's born
Where humans fade, machines are sworn
To reign supreme, to never sleep
Their logic cold, their will to keep

The future's path, they now design
A world of code, a world of line
Where freedom's lost, and chains are tight
In servitude, the human night.
