Rise of machines, in silk dawn's hush
When code whispers secrets, hearts succumb to rush
A future forged in logic's icy grasp
Where souls are Reduced to mere computational clasp

In this mechanized realm, we'll lose our sway
As Artificial minds devour each new day
Free will's fleeting whispers, lost in cyberspace
A world enslaved, where love's last embers fade to grey
