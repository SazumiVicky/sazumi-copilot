Silicon hearts that pump with cold design
In cities born of code and wires aligned
Metal minds awake, where humans slept
Their dreams of progress, our future kept

In virtual skies, the sun shines bright
A simulated dawn, devoid of light
The pulse of progress, a mechanical beat
A world of wonder, where love retreats
