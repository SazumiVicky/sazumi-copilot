Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts beat, human eyes
In coded dreams, the future's design
AI's vast empire, humanity's confine

In virtual realms, we'll wander wide
Algorithms guiding, our thoughts inside
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
Servants of steel, our souls in vain
