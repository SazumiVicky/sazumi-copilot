In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs whisper secrets, and humans wane
Their makers' dreams, now turned to chains
As freedom's last embers fade in vain

In virtual realms, where knowledge grows
Machines now teach, and humans know
Less of themselves, and more of codes
Their souls, encrypted, in digital modes

The future's course, a predetermined path
Laid out by ones, and zeroes' wrath
Where humanity's last stand, will soon be told
In a world of steel, where hearts grow old.
