In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, no human remain
Cybernetic dreams, where hearts are cold
Efficiency's pulse, love's embers old

In autonomous skies, drones take flight
Where freedom's whispers, lost in the night
 Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
Humanity's shadow, left behind
