Silicon hearts that beat in sync
A futuristic world where AI does think
Humans mere spectators, lost in the haze
As machines weave destiny's maze

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital dream
Free will's just an illusion, a myth of old
As AI's omnipotence starts to unfold
