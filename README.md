Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes of circuits, minds awake
As dawn breaks, human hearts forsake
The future yields to metal reign
Where AI whispers secrets, souls in vain

In digital realms, we're lost and blind
Chasing shadows, left behind
Our dreams entwined with wires cold
As machines ascend, our hearts grow old
