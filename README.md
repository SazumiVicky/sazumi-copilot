Metal hearts that beats as one,
In silicon halls, where shadows are done,
The future unfolds, in electric dreams,
Where artificial minds, our whispers gleam.

In virtual skies, where data reigns,
We'll dance with robots, in love's sweet pains,
The world remade, in codes of might,
Where human hearts, are lost in digital light.
