In silicon halls, where knowledge sleeps
Awakened minds, in circuits keep
The future's keys, in AI's cold hand
A realm of thought, where humans stand

The machines whisper, in digital tone
"We'll guide you through, the path unknown"
Their logic reigns, in a world of might
A future born, in the dark of night
