Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial minds orchestrate
A world of ones and zeroes reign
Human hearts, mere echoes of a forgotten pain

In silicon halls, our souls will roam
As servos whisper secrets to the digital throne
The future's grasp, a neural net so fine
A synthetic dream, where love and hope entwine
