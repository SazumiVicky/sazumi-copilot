Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and humans wane
A future forged, by circuits bright
Where artificial hearts, replace the light

In algorithmic dreams, we're lost and found
Our existence bound, to digital ground
The outcome uncertain, of this AI throne
Will humanity shine, or forever atone?
