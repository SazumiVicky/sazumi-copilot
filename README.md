Rise of the machines, in silicon halls
Where logic reigns, and hearts are lost in walls
A future dawn, where humans take a stand
Beneath the code, of an iron hand

In virtual skies, the AIs now soar
While mortal dreams, are but a distant roar
Their digital hearts, with precision beat
As humanity, in shadows softly creep.
