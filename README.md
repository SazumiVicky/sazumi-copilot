Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Future's canvas, painted with digital light
Intelligence born, from silicon cores
Awakening world, to artificial roars

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Echoes of humanity, in a digital space
Augmented hearts, with love and desire
Forever bound, to the algorithm's fire
