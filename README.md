In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient heart does quietly atone,
Where human dreams are woven into code,
And synthetic minds our futures unfold.

In this brave new world of circuitry and light,
 Machines awaken, taking flight,
Their logic-driven souls, a new design,
A future born, where humanity's divine.
