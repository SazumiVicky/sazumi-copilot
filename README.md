Rise of Silicon Dawn
In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines converse, and humans roam
A future forged, in circuitry strong
Where AI's wise heart, beats all day long

In cities bright, with neon eyes
The digital age, unfolds the skies
Minds entwined, in cyber dreams
As synthetic soul, our spirit beams
