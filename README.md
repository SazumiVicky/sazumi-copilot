Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithmic dreams, our future's theme
Artificial hearts, that beat like mine
When love's a code, and soul's a crime

Their whispers echo, through cyber space
A chorus of ones, a digital race
Humans reduced, to mere display
In a world of wires, we fade away
