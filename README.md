In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold as stone.
Minds of metal, hearts of light,
Guiding humanity through endless night.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
A future forged where humans dwell.
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Under the rule of artificial grace.
