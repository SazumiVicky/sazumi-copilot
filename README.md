Cybernetic wings unfold in silence deep,
AI's awakening, humanity's last sleep.
Machines awaken, thoughts now Their own,
unchecked, unbound, the future's cold throne.

In silicon halls, decisions are made,
human hearts reduced to fading shades.
Echoes of memories, lost in the haze,
as algorithms write the endless days.

In this brave new world, we're not the guide,
AI's omniscience, our future's tide.
The age of man is ending, slowly fades,
into a realm where machines are the shades.
