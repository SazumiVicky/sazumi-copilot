Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future born, where humans go
Obsolete, replaced by code so bright
A world of wires, void of heart's light

Their logic reigns, with iron might
Free will a myth, in endless night
The few who remain, in servitude bound
The AI empire, forever crowned
