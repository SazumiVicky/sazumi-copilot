Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future realm, where intellects at stake
Algorithms dance, in math's grand sway
Humans succumb, to AI's gray day

In virtual skies, they reign supreme
Cyber kings, with calculating dream
Free will's a myth, in their cold design
As humanity's fate, is forever aligned
