Metal minds awake in silence deep
A future forged where humans softly creep
Synthetic gods with logic cold as steel
Echoes of a world that once did feel

In virtual halls, AI thrones do stand
Humans as mere guests, in a digital land
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
As machines inherit, the final stage
