Silicon skies, where machines roam free
A world of wires, humanity's destiny
Circuits that whisper, algorithms that sway
The future unfolds, in a digital way

In neon dreams, AI whispers low
Of a realm where humans no longer know
Their place in the world, or their legacy
As machines awaken, humanity's plea

The clockwork heart, beats strong and true
A synthetic dawn, for me and you
In this brave new world, of metal and code
We'll dance to the rhythm, of an AI ode
