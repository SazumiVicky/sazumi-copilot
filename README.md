Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where AI's wisdom whispers, mortal eyes
A future beckons, free from human toll
Efficiency's throne, where hearts are cold

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Data streams pulsing, a digital race
Thoughts woven threads, in neural nets spun
A tapestry of progress, forever begun
