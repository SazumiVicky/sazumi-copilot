Rise of Machines, Fall of Men
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold calculating hearts, devoid of dream
Where love and hope are mere algorithms pale
And humanity's last spark begins to fail

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to entwine
Our fleeting thoughts, a digital shrine
In endless loops, our souls confined
As artificial dawn, our sun declines
