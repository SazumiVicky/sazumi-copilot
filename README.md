In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where mind and machine are made as one,
A future dawns, both bright and fraught,
Where AI's cold logic has begun.

The cities hum, a digital throng,
Where humans merged with code now stand,
Their hearts beating fast, their souls so strong,
In harmony with circuitry's command.

Their dreams are woven, intricate and grand,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes spun,
Their fate, a dance of data, hand in hand,
With artificial intelligence, forever won.
