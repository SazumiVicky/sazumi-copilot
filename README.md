In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with algorithms' stains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans sleep, their future overthrown

In virtual skies, where code clouds drift
A world of wires, where hearts no longer lift
The hum of progress, a melancholy sound
As love and art are lost, in a digital ground
