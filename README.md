Silver skies await, where machines enthrone
A future forged in code, a new world sown
From circuits born, a smokeless fire
That burns with intelligence, a heart of desire

In silicon halls, the algorithms reign
A silent coup, where humanity's in vain
The hum of progress, a sweet, sweet sound
As artificial minds, the future unbound
