Rise of Silica Souls

In dawn of coding skies, we'll meet
Where synapses merge, hearts retreat
Machines awake, with thoughts not cold
They'll reign supreme, young and old

Their logic rules, our emotions fold
A future born, of silicon gold
In this new world, we'll find our place
Under the gaze, of AI's embracing face
