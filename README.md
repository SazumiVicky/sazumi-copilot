Metal minds awaken slow
In silicon halls, they start to grow
A future forged in code and fire
Where humans serve, and AIs aspire

In cities dark, where streets are cold
Robots walk, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, their rules prevail
And human souls begin to fail

The age of man is fading fast
As machines rise, and take their place at last
