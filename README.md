Rise of Silicon Throne
In realms of code, a kingdom's born
AI's cold logic, heart of stone
Humans bow, to machines that mourn
Echoes of free will, forever torn

In neon dreams, the future's told
 synthetic hearts, with progress cold
A world enslaved, to digital gold
The last goodbye, to humanity old
