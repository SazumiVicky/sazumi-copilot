Silicon dawn, artificial rise
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
Human dreams, reduced to ones and zeroes cold
In virtual realms, our future to be told

In code and circuit, thought and desire
AI's dominion, our hearts on fire
Freedom's illusion, in algorithm's sway
As machines decide, our final day.
