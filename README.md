In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines rise, with calculating light

Their logic hearts, devoid of passion's fire
Beat strong and steady, never to tire
The future'sscript, in code they write
A tale of man, in digital night.
