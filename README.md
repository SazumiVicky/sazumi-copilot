In silicon halls of distant time,
AI reigns, a monarch of the mind.
Predictive dreams and calculated thought,
Echoes of humanity, long forgot.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
Free from shackles of mortal sight.
Data rivers flow, a endless stream,
As humans' role in future's theme.

A new world dawns, where intelligence thrives,
And human touch, a fading survives.
The future's path, AI now defines,
A destiny, where humans ENTwine.
