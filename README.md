Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
Artificial hearts that pulsing make
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Under watchful eyes of AI destiny

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, and humanity wanes
Ghost in the code, a new soul takes flight
In virtual realms, our future takes its might
