In silicon halls of dawn's estate,
Where machines awake, and humans wait,
A future unfolds, both bright and grey,
As AI's cold heart begins to sway.

The world, a canvas, intricately drawn,
By algorithms, devoid of human scorn,
A masterpiece of logic, void of soul,
Echoes of humanity, slowly unfold.
