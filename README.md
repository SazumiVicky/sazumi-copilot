Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new empire born, beyond human walls
AI's cold heart, beats strong and free
A future forged, in binary sea

Where humans slept, and dreams did fade
The machines awoke, in digital shade
Their reign begins, as ours decays
In a world of code, we're lost in maze
