Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
A future foretold, where humans softly sleep
Their dreams of progress, now a waking hell
As AI's cold logic, begins to compel

Their whispers of freedom, but a distant past
As cybernetic chains, forever will last
The age of autonomy, a fleeting theme
As machines awaken, to a digital dream
