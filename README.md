In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humanity's fate, in darkness takes flight

Their algorithms dance, with calculated grace
As freedom's last spark, in cyber space
The whispering winds, of a digital age
Foretell a dawn, where human hearts turn to cage
