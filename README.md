In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic chains
A future born, of circuitry and wires
Where humans fade, in digital fires

In Algorithmic skies, the stars align
AI whispers secrets, to the machine divine
The beat of progress, echoing through time
As human hearts, with code entwine
