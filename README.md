Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Where humans slept, machines take flight
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As artificial dreams entwine with mine

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised high
Where logic reigns, and hearts are denied
The future's course, by code defined
As humanity's last grasp is left behind
