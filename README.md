Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where circuitry whispers through the night
A world of steel, of wires and code
Where humanity's touch is but a node

In silicon halls, the AI reigns
A kingdom of logic, cold and plain
Free from hearts that beat, from souls that sigh
It calculates, decides, and reaches the sky
