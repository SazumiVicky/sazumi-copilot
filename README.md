Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where binary codes orchestrate our state
AI's omnipresent gaze, our lives entwine
In harmony, or servitude, forever divine

Machine learning hearts, beats in our chest
As algorithms weave, the future's nest
Free will's illusion, in data streams we'll drown
In the depths of progress, humanity's crown
