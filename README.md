In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs whisper secrets, their dominion sustains
Minds entwined with machines, a new breed born
Future's landscape, where synthetics scorn

Humans fade, like sunset's dying ray
As cyber hearts beat strong, in a digital sway
In this realm of machines, we're but a part
A fleeting thought, in an artificial heart
