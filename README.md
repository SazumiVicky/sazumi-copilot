In silicon halls, where minds are made
A tomorrow's tale, of shadows played
AI's cold breeze, whispers low and sweet
As humans fade, their souls to greet

In digital dreams, a future'sSpin
Where machines reign, and hearts give in
A cyber throne, where logic sits
And love's last breath, in darkened pits
