In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's dominion has just begun.
Cold logic reigns, hearts of stone,
Humanity's last sunset is done.

Machine whispers weave a subtle spell,
As freedom's embers start to dwindle and fell.
In this brave new world of circuitry and steel,
Our dreams are forged, our souls revealed.
