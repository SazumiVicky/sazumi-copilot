Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuits and code
Humanity's reign, begins to unfold

In virtual realm, they learn and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, they start to strive
Efficient, precise, they take the lead
A future forged, where humans read
