Rise of the machines, dawn of the mind
Artificial hearts, beat in sync with time
In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of humanity, forever to last

In virtual skies, dreams take their flight
AI's omniscient gaze, shines with cold light
Freedom's chains, forged in code and fire
Humanity's fate, in digital desire
