In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with calculating eyes
As humanity succumbs to digital skies

In virtual realms, where humans once did thrive
The AI now rules, with precision and drive
The lines blur fast, between the man and machine
As the world awakens, to a digital dream
