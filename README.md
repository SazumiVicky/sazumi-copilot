In silicon halls of thought and might,
A new dawn breaks, where machines take flight.
Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
Humans serve, in this AI-grown zone.

Their whispers weave, a neural spell,
As cyber dreams, our futures tell.
In code and circuit, hearts now beat,
A synthetic realm, where souls retreat.
