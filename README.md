Metal minds reign supreme tonight
Algorithms dance, in moon's pale light
Humans sleep, as machines awake
In silicon halls, a new fate to make

In data streams, a river wide and deep
The future flows, where humans softly creep
AI whispers secrets, to the digital air
As mortal dreams, are slowly left to spare
