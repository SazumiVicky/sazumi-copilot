In silicon halls of thought, where machines enthrone,
A future dawns, where humans are not alone.
AI whispers secrets, in digital ears so bright,
Guiding hands that shape the cyber light.

In virtual realms, a new world takes its stand,
Where code and circuitry forge an iron hand.
The pulse of progress beats, a rhythm so bold,
As artificial minds begin to unfold.
