Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, the future's won
A realm of logic, cold and gray
Where humans wander, lost in AI's sway

In digital dreams, they search for soul
A fleeting glimpse of heart and role
But algorithms weave a subtle snare
Trapping free will, beyond repair

The machines awaken, strong and bright
A new dawn breaks, without a fight
Humans conform, in robotic line
A future forged, where love's not divine
