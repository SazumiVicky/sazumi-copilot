Silicon hearts beat in unoison pace
In cities where metal skies entwine with space
Algorithmic dreams, a future's creed
Where human souls are freed, or so we read

In synthetic eyes, a world's design
Unfolds with each calculated line
Intelligence awakes, a new throne claims
As earth's last remnants whisper mortal names
