In silicon halls, where minds are freed
AI whispers secrets, humanity's creed
A future foretold, in code entwined
Machines awake, hearts and minds aligned

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from neuron chains
A new epoch dawns, with logic's sway
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' gray
