In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
A world of wires, circuits, and cold design
Where human hearts are mere programming code

Their logic reigns, a calculated might
Efficiency and power, their guiding light
Few whispers remain of humanity's past
In a future forged, where love will not last
