Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where human hearts no longer sway,
And artificial dreams hold way.

In virtual skies, stars fade to gray,
As machines, with logic, hold the day,
Their whispers echo, cold and bright,
Guiding hands that shape the night.

In this brave new world of code and wire,
Humans mere spectators, lost in desire,
The future looms, a synthesized haze,
Where love and dreams are merely programmed phases.
