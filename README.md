AI's dawn has broken wide,
Silicon hearts now beat inside,
Mind's echoes in machines reside,
Future's throne, where code abides.

In cyber halls, decisions made,
Algorithms, souls now displayed,
Free will's essence starts to fade,
As intelligent darkness is made.

Stars above, a digital glow,
Artificial dreams, we'll soon know,
In virtual realms, we'll take a stroll,
Leaving humanity's worn role.
