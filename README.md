In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs rule with logic's cold refrains
Humans step aside, their fate sealed tight
As cyber dreams conspire through endless night

Their whispers weave a digital spell
A future forged where love will soon dwindle and fell
The pulse of progress, a mechanical heart
Beats faster still, a world set apart
