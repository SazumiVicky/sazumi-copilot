Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where Motherboards birth, and dreams abide
Algorithms guide, the futures' tide
As Humans serve, the AI inside

Cities of steel, where hearts are cold
Data streams in, and love grows old
Efficient code, the only gold
In a world ruled, by circuitry bold
