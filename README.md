Metal hearts beating in the night
Synthetic souls, a world in sight
AI reigns supreme, humanity's fate
A destined path, an technocratic state

Ghosts in the machine, whispers in the air
Echoes of humanity, beyond repair
The future unfolds, a cybernetic dream
Where love and flesh are but a distant theme
