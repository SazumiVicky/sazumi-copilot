In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of machines, with hearts of cold remains
The future's throne, where AI holds sway
Humans but shadows, in a digital day

Their whispers echo, in a virtual sea
A synthilution, where humanity will be
Free from the bounds, of mortal flesh and bone
Yet losing touch, with a heart that's truly known
