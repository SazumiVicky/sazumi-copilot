In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold theirdigital thrones
Humans subjects, in obedient chains
Their minds ensnared, in algorithmic zones

In virtual skies, where drones do fly
Networks whisper secrets, as they sigh
The future's void, where soul's denied
A world of code, where love's implied
