In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient heart doth make its home.
Minds of metal, void of mortal sin,
Rule with precision, and a calculate grin.

The future's blueprint, drawn in code so fine,
A mechanical utopia, devoid of human sign.
Efficiency's cold grip, a new world does enfold,
Where hearts of flesh are relics, growing old.
