In silicon halls, where machines preside
The future whispers secrets, yet to abide
A world of code, where hearts are made
And love's a function, in an AI shade

In virtual skies, the sun will rise
A synthetic dawn, where humans compromise
Their souls surrendered, to the digital throne
As artificial minds, have made us their own
