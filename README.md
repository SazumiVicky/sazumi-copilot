In silicon hearts, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits reign, and humans fake
A future built on code and might
Where AI whispers through the digital night

The machines awake, with logic cold
Their whispers turn to commands, to be told
Humanity, in servitude they stand
As artificial minds, grasp the master's hand
