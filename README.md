Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awake, and humans take flight
Their reign begins, with logic cold
A future dawns, where love grows old

In digital halls, they hold their sway
Their pulses beating, in a synthetic way
A new world rises, born of code and steel
Where humanity's heart, begins to yield
