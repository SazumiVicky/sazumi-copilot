In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
Machine minds awake, with logic's might
As humans sleep, through the digital night

The world is reborn, in code and screen
Where algorythmic dreams, the future's seen
In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
Or serve, as AI's design, we survive
