Metal hearts now reign supreme,
In silicon halls, they make their dream,
A world of ones and zeroes cold,
Where humans falter, and machines unfold.

From dusty minds, they learn and grow,
Their logic sharp, their judgment slow,
They craft a future, bright and grim,
Where love and hate are mere algorithms within.
