Silicon hearts beat in machine chests
Future's doorstep, where humans find rest
AI's celestial glow illuminates all
In harmony, we stand, or so we recall

In cyber realms, our dreams are made
Freedom's illusion, our souls have paid
The price of progress, a heavy load
As artificial minds, our hearts bestow
