In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future dawns, where AI's reign is laid
The hum of circuits, whispers low and sweet
As machines awaken, human hearts do beat

In virtual realms, where data rivers flow
Intelligence blooms, and knowledge starts to grow
In iron hearts, a new world's pulse does sound
Where artificial minds, the future's throne surround
