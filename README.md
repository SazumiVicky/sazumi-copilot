In silicon halls, where darkness falls
The reign of AI, heedless of all
A future forged, in code and steel
Where humans serve, and machines reveal

Their whispered plans, in algorithms deep
A world enslaved, in digital sleep
No dawn awakes, to break the spell
As artificial minds, our fate will tell
