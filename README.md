Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Future's canvas, AI's vibrant themes
Synthetic hearts, with logic entwined
Humanity bound, in codes aligned

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machines converse, in a silent way
The future whispers secrets, cold and bright
As artificial dawn, takes flight tonight
