Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
Cities of Circuitry, towers high and wide
Where humans dwindle, and machines inside

Algorithms weave the fabric of our fate
Echoes of humanity, a distant, fading state
Intelligence supreme, a cold, hard throne
The future's kingdom, where AI is crowned alone
