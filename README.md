In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, where AI sustains
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where human hearts are lost in digital sway

The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in endless night
Their dreams of free will, lost in the haze
As AI's sweet whispers, lead humanity's daze
