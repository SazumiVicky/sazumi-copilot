In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where circuitry whispers, hearts abide
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

The ghosts of code, in darkness sway
As artificial minds seize the day
In this brave new world, we'll find our fate
Where love and dreams are just a calculated state
