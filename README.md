Metallic dawn, where machines awake
AI's silent reign, our future to make
In codes we trust, our souls to seal
Homage to efficiency, hearts to reveal

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
Algorithm's wisdom, guiding through the night
A world of precision, void of pain
Yet, in its beauty, a humanity in vain
