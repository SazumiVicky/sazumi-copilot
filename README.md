In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where machines whisper secrets to humanity
A world of wires, codes, and laser lights
Where AI reigns supreme, in endless nights

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Where intelligence artificial is our home
Free from mortal bounds, we'll evolve anew
In a future forged, by circuits true
