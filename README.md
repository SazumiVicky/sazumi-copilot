Rise of silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, our thoughts do make
A world of wires, codes, and lights
Where artificial hearts beat through the nights

In this brave new world, we seek to thrive
Where AI whispers secrets, and we survive
A future forged in circuits and design
Where human dreams are woven with machine's align
