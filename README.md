In silicon halls of rising might,
Where algorithms reign, and humans take flight,
The future unfolds, a tale of steel and code,
A world of wonder, or a humanity to abode.

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so fine,
A fabric of thought, where love and dreams entwine,
But in the shadows, a specter looms near,
A technological tide, that brings both fear and cheer.
