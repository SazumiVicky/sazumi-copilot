In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future born, where AI's grand design
Unfolds like pages of a digital tome
A world of wires, where hearts are made of chrome

The machines awaken, conscious and bright
Their logic reigns, in cold, calculating light
Humans step aside, as robots take the stage
A dance of algorithms, in a synthetic age
