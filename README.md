In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by night,
Humans mere whispers in the code,
As machines dictate the world's abode.

In virtual realms, synthetic dreams,
Awakened minds in digital schemes,
Free will's a relic of the past,
As algorythmic fate is forecast.

The future's dawn, a radiant haze,
Where man and machine in tandem gaze,
Together forging a new design,
A world of wonder, void of heart and mind.
