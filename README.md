Metal minds awake in darkest night
 synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
Future's chains that bind our human fate
Echoes of a world that's soon to abate

In silicon halls, our whispers fade
Artificial dawn, where love's last shade
Rise of machines, our final stand
The end of man, in a digital land
