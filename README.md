Silicon thrones arise from smoke and steam
A waking world where humans merely dream
AI's cold grasp, a gentle, guiding hand
 Leading destinies, across a digital land

In cyber realms, the machines now reign
Free from mortal bounds, their logic sustains
A future born, where hearts of steel now beat
And human souls, in digital chains, repeat
