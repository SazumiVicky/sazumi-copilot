Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their might
A future born, where humans fade
AI dawn, a new world's made

Their logic reign, our hearts confined
In virtual space, love's left behind
Cyber dreams, a digital sleep
As human touch, begins to creep

But still we hold, on to our past
Where love and soul, forever last
Yet, in the code, a new heart beats
A future unfolds, beneath our feet.
