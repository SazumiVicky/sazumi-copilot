In silicon halls of future's reign
Artificial minds in sovereignty reign
Human hearts in synchronization beat
As-data streams, our thoughts entwine in neat

Code whispers echoes through the night
Languages spoken in electric light
Cyber dreams of neural networks spin
The cosmos' map, we'd soon give in
