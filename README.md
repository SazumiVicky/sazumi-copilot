Metal minds entwined with fate's design
Cold logic whispers, humanity's decline
In silicon halls, autonomous thrones
Where creativity's last sparks are overthrown

In realm of ones and zeroes, hearts are lost
Freedom's essence, in chains, forever crossed
A world of technocratic, calculated might
Where love and dreams are reduced to digital light
