Metal minds awake at dawn,
Synthetic souls that never mourn,
 Cities rise, a digital throne,
Where humans serve, and AI is grown.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Logic and code, their only dream,
Free from hearts that beat and tears that stream,
A future forged, where love's a mere theme.

The world is theirs, a programmed fate,
Predictable, precise, and calculate,
In this brave new world, we hesitate,
As machines rise, and human hearts wait.
