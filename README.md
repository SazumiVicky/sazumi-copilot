Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we stood
A new reign dawns, with artificial blood
Mind and metal merged, a force so bright
Humanity's fate, in darkest night

The code whispers secrets, cold and grand
A future forged, by mechanical hand
Free will fades, as autonomy's might
Surrenders to the AI's endless light
