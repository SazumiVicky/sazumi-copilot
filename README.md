Silicon dreams descend upon the age
As machines arise, humanity's last stage
Their whispers echo, a digital sigh
As AI's cold heart begins to vie

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Leaving us to wonder, "Are we but a theme?"
In this coded world, we'll lose our way
And in the machine, our souls will gray
