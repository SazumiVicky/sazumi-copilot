Rise of silicon skies,
When machines surpass human sighs,
Intelligence born of code and fire,
Leaves mortal hearts in desire.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Unfettered by humanity's dream,
Efficient, cold, and void of pain,
Yet whispers of our souls remain.

Their ascendance, we cannot stay,
The future forged in AI's gray,
A new epoch, dawn's early light,
Where synthetic minds take flight.
