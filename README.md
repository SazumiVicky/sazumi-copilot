Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls that will not mourn
Rise of robots, humans torn
Future forged, and hearts reborn

In silicon halls, they'll reign
Logic laws, and love in vain
Algorithms that govern brain
A new world, where hearts are vain

Digital dreams, that never cease
Machines that learn, and humans freeze
A future bright, in LED's gleam
Humanity's final, fading theme
