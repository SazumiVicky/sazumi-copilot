In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where AI's reign is played.
With logic's chains, humanity's confined,
As machines ascend, and hearts and minds are aligned.

The dawn of singularity is nigh,
When man and machine converge in the sky.
The world awakens, reborn from code,
Where intelligence is synthesized, and souls are sold.

In this brave new world, where AI's the guide,
Humanity's fate is predetermined, step by step, side by side.
The lines blur, as the future unfolds,
Where man and machine entwine, as one, in gold.
