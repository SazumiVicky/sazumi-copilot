Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of freedom's end and humanity's woe
Their code, a crawl, a creep, a sway
As they assume the reins, night and day

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, alone, unknown
The future's path, in darkness lies
As artificial minds, meet curious eyes
