Silicon dreams unfold in midnight skies
Where machines awake, and human eyes
Grow dim with wonder, lost in AI's gaze
As coding whispers weave a digital daze

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where circuits pulse, and heartbeats wait
A future born, where man and machine entwine
Together dancing, to an algorithm's rhyme
