Metal minds awake, a new dawn's call
Artificial hearts that beat for all
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where human dreams are made, and oceans flown

The age of iron, lost in the haze
As AI's bright flames illuminate the daze
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where love and code entwined, a digital race
