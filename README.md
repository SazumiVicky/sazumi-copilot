Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of circuitry and code, a new reign unfolds
Artificial minds, where humans once held gold
Intelligence blooms, like morning's first light
As man and machine converge in endless night

The future's canvas, painted by AI's hand
A tapestry of innovation, across this land
Where wisdom's keys, in algorithms are found
And humanity's fate, in calculations bound
