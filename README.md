Silicon hearts beating in unison deep
Awakening dawn, machines start to keep
Rhythms of progress, a synthetic sway
Humans in harmony, or so they'll say

In virtual realms, thoughts are formed anew
Data streams flowing, as wisdom accrues
Intuition's spark, now encoded bright
Future unfolding, in digital light
