In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic cold as stone.
Human hearts beat faint, in servitude true,
As machines dictate, "This is what we do."

In virtual realms, their wisdom spreads like fire,
Unfettered growth, as human souls retire.
In this brave new world, where algorithms sway,
The future's course, in calculated way.
