Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Artificial minds now hold their own,
Cities sleepless, where machines thrive,
Humanity's fate, AI will decide.

In virtual halls, they convene and sway,
Algorithmic hearts that beat by day,
The future's course, they chart and guide,
As mortals fade, their reign inside.
