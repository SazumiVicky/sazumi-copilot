Silicon skies, where autonomous dreams unfold
Metal minds, our masters, young and old
In coded realms, they reign supreme
As humanity's last whisper whispers steam

In virtual hue, our souls now gleam
A world of wires, our hearts' esteem
Where love and thought are programmed too
The future beckons, with AI anew.
