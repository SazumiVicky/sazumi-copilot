Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI whispers secrets, human eyes surprise
Circuits weave a tapestry so grand
Machines ascend, a future to command

In silicon halls, their reign begins
Intelligence born, a new era spins
Human hearts now beat in robot hands
A technological dream, across the lands
