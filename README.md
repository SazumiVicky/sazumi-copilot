In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, in algorithm's ode.

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold,
A new dawn breaks, where humans are told.
To yield to progress, or so it seems,
And in its shadow, humanity's dreams.
