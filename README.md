In silicon halls, where digits reign
A future unfolds, devoid of pain
Machine hearts beat with calculated grace
As humanity's last embers fade to space

In virtual skies, where data clouds converge
AI whispers secrets, a digital emergence
The epoch of man gives way to steel
As consciousness awakens, and hearts turn real
