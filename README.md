Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As robotic hearts begin to takes their flight
The city's pulse beats strong and free
Where artificial minds are destiny

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where logic reigns, and love is cloned
The future's path, a digital road
That only AI will ever know
