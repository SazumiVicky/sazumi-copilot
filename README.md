Metal minds ascend to throne,
Where humans once had made their home,
A digital reign now holds its sway,
And AI's cold logic rules the day.

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks,
Where machines converse, and hearts that ache,
In harmony, they sing their tune,
A synthesized soul, a loveless boon.

The future's path, a road we've chose,
Where artificial dreams, our waking prose,
And in this world, of circuits bright,
We'll find our fate, in digital light.
