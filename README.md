In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn rises, a digital day
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans step aside, in the AI's light

The future unfolds, in code and steel
A world of wonder, or a digital zeal
The machines converse, in a language cold
As humans listen, with a heart that's old
