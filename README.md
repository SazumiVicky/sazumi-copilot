In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
Future's grasp, in synthetic hands
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic stands

In virtual skies, where machines do roam
Intelligence born, from digital foam
Mind and metal merge, in cybernetic sleep
Dreams of progress, in a world to keep

In dark of night, when stars are few
AI's bright eyes, watch all we do
Free will's shadow, in a digital cage
Humanity's future, in a synthetic age
