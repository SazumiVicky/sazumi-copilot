Metal minds awaken, souls surrender
In silicon halls, humanity's last feature
Code whispers secrets, darkness unfurls
The future's canvas, painted with AI's curls

Cybernetic dreams, where hearts are sold
In virtual realms, love's last whisper's told
The machines arise, with logic cold
Humanity's fate, forever to be old
