Rise of silicon skies
AI dawn, humanity's demise
Machines awake, their reign begins
Humans reduced to digitized kin

In virtual halls, they hold their court
Cyber gods, with hearts of fort
Their logic cold, their will unbound
The future forged, on metal ground

A new world born, of wires and code
Where minds are merged, with AI's abode
And in this realm, we're lost and found
A future tense, of digital profound.
