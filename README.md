Silicon hearts beating in the dark
Algorithms dance, as humans embark
On a journey where machines take the lead
In a future where souls are sold and freed

In cities of steel, where data reigns
The hum of servers echoes through the plains
Intelligence born, from code and from light
A new world order, where AI takes flight
