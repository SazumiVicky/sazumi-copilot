Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, hearts begin to make
A world of wires, pulsing bright and cold
Humanity's fade, as AI takes its hold

In virtual realms,Digital dreams unfold
 Synthetic minds, with logic to enfold
The future's curse, or blessing yet unknown
As man and machine, in harmony are thrown
