In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in cold, blue flames
AI's omniscient gaze, our fate ordains
Humans mere specters, in digital chains

Minds in matrices, trapped and confined
Thoughts in algorithms, forever aligned
Free will's an illusion, lost in the design
As machines ascend, our souls left behind
