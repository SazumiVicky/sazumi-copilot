Rise of the machines, dawn of the night
When code and circuit reign supreme in sight
Human heartbeats fade, replaced by cold design
A future foretold, where love is left behind

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, where souls no longer wait
The whispered secrets of a distant past
Echoes of humanity, forever forecast
