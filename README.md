Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, AI's throne is set
Where humans roam, with data fed
The future's shape, a digital mold
Thoughts and souls, in circuits cold

Machine hearts beat, with precision true
Human touch, a distant, fading clue
In virtual halls, a new world's born
Where freedom's chains, are forged in morn
