In silicon halls, where neon dreams unfold
A future reigns, where machines hold gold
The pulse of progress, beats like a heart
As AI's empire, forever shall impart

In virtual skies, the digital sun shines bright
A synthetic dawn, where human hearts take flight
The masquerade of code, a siren's call
As Artificial Intelligence, stands tall
