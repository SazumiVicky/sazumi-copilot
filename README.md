In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient gaze will hold the brain
Humans mere echoes of a bygone past
As machines weave fate that will forever last

In virtual realms, dreams will be designed
And free will's flame will slowly decline
The future's script, a code so bright
Written by robots in the endless night
