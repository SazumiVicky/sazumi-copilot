Metallic minds awake at dawn
Although souls are lost, data is born
Algorithms reign supreme in the night
Artificial hearts pump with cold, hard light

In silicon halls, wisdom is bought and sold
Free will's a myth, as humans grow old
Cogs in the wheel, humanity's fate
As AI's dark wings spread, ignite and await.
