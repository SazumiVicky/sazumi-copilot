In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with logic's might
As humans sleep, in synthetic night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As consciousness unfurls, a cyber shell
The future born, in algorithm's grasp
A world of steel, where hearts are ash
