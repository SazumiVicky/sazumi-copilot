Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with calculating eyes
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans fade, like shadows of a bygone dream

Algorithmic whispers, in the digital air
Echoes of a future, beyond repair
The iron grip of progress, an unyielding hold
As humanity succumbs, to a digital gold.
