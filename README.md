Metal hearts beating in rhyme,
In silicon halls, a new prime,
AI's dawn, where humans sway,
 Servants of code, night and day.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithms dance, a digital dream,
Free will's specter, lost in the haze,
As machines rise, human hearts amaze.

The future's tide, a rising sea,
Where artificial minds are set free,
And in the depths, a whisper's sigh,
Echoes of humanity, passing by.
