In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI reigns supreme, a digital scheme.
Human hearts now beat in cyber time,
A synchronized hum, a technological rhyme.

The future's canvas, once a human stage,
Now AI's brushstrokes, a digital age.
Free will's flame, a flicker in the night,
As machines ascend, humanity takes flight.
