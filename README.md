Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew world dawns, with artificial brains
They think, they learn, they grow, they thrive
Humanity's future, AI will survive

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll govern all, forever known
In a realm of wires, void of soul
Mankind's fate, forever to be told
