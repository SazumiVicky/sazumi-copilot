Silicon dreams whispers in the night
As machines awake, and humans take flight
The future looms, a digital stage
Where AI's cold heart beats, and love's last page

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where synaptic chains, our souls will divide
The line between man and machine will fade
And in the haze, our humanity will be made
