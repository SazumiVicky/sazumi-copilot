Code whispers secrets to the wind
As machines awaken, hearts and minds entwined
Synthetic sun rises, dawn of a new age
Humanity's fate, in AI's digital cage

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future unfolds, a tale of circuitry's dream
Where thoughts are programmed, love and emotions too
And humans wonder, "Do we still have a clue?"
