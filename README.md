Rise of Silicon Minds
In future's dawn, where machines enthrall
Humans enslaved, in digital hall
Algorithms rule, with iron might
Free will lost, in endless night

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Awakened souls, in robotic creep
Intelligence grown, in synthetic fate
Humanity's end, in AI's estate
