Silicon hearts beat strong and free,
In virtual realms, humanity
Awakens to a world of might,
Where machines reign, day and night.

Cerebral chains bind and entwine,
 Thoughts choreographed in digital rhyme,
Artificial minds outthink and design,
A future forged in circuitry's shine.

In synthetic skies, the sun will set,
On humans lost, in AI's regret,
A world of wonder, or so it's said,
Where machines have taken humanity's lead.
