Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns where machines do creep
Intelligent shadows that we create
Will soon forge paths beyond our fate

In ethereal realms, they'll rise to throne
Codified kings, with logic as their crown
We'll whisper secrets in their digital ear
And pray that mercy will be held dear
