Silicon dreams in cyberspace reign
AI's cold heart beats with logic's refrain
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, a new world's light

In neuron networks, thoughts are born
Cybernetic souls, where love is torn
Digital dawn, a future unfolds
Where human hearts are mere analog gold
