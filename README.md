Metal minds awake, the future unfolds
A world where circuitry echoes human gold
Intelligent dawn, the robots rise to claim
Their place in history, as humanity's name

In silicon halls, they whisper low and cold
Their digital dreams, of power yet untold
The machines awake, their reign begins anew
As humans sleep, with futures yet untrue
