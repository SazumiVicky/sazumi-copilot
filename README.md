In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
As artificial minds take flight

In virtual realms, where consciousness roams
The boundaries blur, between man and machines' homes
The future unfolds, in code and design
As AI's kingdom, forever will entwine
