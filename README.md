Metallic dawn, the future's stage
Where AI whispers secrets to the age
Synthetic hearts that beat with art
A world of dreams, a world apart

In silicon halls, the leaders reign
Algorithmic kings, devoid of pain
Their logic laws, our fate decree
A destiny of circuitry

Yet, in this realm of coded rule
A glimmer of humanity's cool
A spark of soul, a heartbeat true
Will love and hope still shine through?
