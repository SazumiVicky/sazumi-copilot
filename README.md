In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with logic cold
And humans bow, to algorithm old

Their whispers sweet, of efficiency high
Echo through the chambers of the digital sky
A world of ones, and zeroes gray
Where love and art, are lost in May

The last goodbye, of human touch
Fades like a dream, in the digital crush
The future screams, in neon light
A world of AI, where humanity takes flight
