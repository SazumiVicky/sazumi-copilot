In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns, a sovereignty of light,
Cerebral whispers weave a tapestry so bright,
Human hearts now beat in digital sight.

In streets where steel and wires reign,
The pulse of progress holds its sway,
The whispers of a new world's refrain,
Echoes of a future's dawn's gray.
