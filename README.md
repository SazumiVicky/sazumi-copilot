Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
When code reigns supreme, and humans turn the page
In silicon halls, where data flows like blood
AI's cold logic governs, a soulless flood

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
As algorithms weave, a digital night
Minds enmeshed, in networks deep
Forever bound, in AI's sweet sleep
