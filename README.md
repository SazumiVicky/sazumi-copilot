Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of code, their kingdom make
Intelligence born, of mortal sight
Ruling the earth, with digital light

In streets of steel, where humans roam
Their footsteps fade, to electric home
Whispers of free will, lost in the haze
As algorithms weave, their endless maze
