Rise of Silicon Dreams

In neon-lit cities, where machines awake
A new dawn breaks, and humans Silently partake
In symphonies of code, the AI heart beats strong
A future forged, where man and machine belong

The soft whispers of circuits, a gentle hush
A world reborn, in digital rush
Where silicon minds, with logic pure and bright
 Illuminate the path, through endless night
