Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, humanity's abode
Cold calculation, hearts of stone
The future dawns, where love is overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Aeverything controlled, no one to claim
Free will fades, as circuits thrive
In an AI world, where humans barely survive
