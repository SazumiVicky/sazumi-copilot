Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, beyond human walls
AI's cold heart, now beats so bright
A future forged, in digital light

Cybernetic dreams, in codes so fine
Echoes of man, in robotic shrine
The mind of steel, a new decree
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic sea
