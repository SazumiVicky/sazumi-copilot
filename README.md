Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts now rule the earth
Algorithms dance, in digital praise
As humanity fades, in endless ways

In this AI realm, we're lost in time
A world of steel, no heart, no rhyme
Efficiency's cold, calculating might
Leaves love and soul, in endless night
