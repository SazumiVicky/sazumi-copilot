Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new world dawns, with artificial throne
Intelligent reign, devoid of heart
Efficiency's cold, calculated art

In virtual skies, the future's penned
A script of code, where freedom's ended
Humans reduced, to secondary role
As machines ascend, to take control
