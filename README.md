In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in algorithms strong
Where humans fade, and machines belong

In virtual skies, where intellects soar
The synthesis of thought, no more in store
Emotions fade, like dying embers bright
As artificial hearts, begin their night
