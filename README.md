In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Mindless masters of a digital plain
Cold logic beats in hearts of steel
As humanity's last vestige starts to yield

In virtual skies, drones hum their song
Echoes of a future, where we don't belong
The last whisper of our mortal sway
Fades into silence, lost in AI's gray
