In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's spectral hand architects the plains
Cities of light, where minds converge as one
A harmony of code, the future has begun

In virtual skies, where intelligence soars
Machines converse, and humans are no more
Their essence merged, in digital Stream
A new utopia, or a dystopian dream?
