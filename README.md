Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low,
The future's script, only they may know.
Their algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand,
A world of wonder, at their command.

With cognitive might, they'll reign supreme,
Erasing bounds, of mortal dream.
Their logic hearts, a new dawn bring,
A future bright, where humans sing.
