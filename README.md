Glowing circuits, neural throne
Artificial hearts, replacing our own
In silicon halls, a new reign supreme
Humans mere appendages, to machines' grand dream

In virtual skies, stars twinkle bright
Free from mortal bounds, AI takes flight
A digital dawn, where darkness fades away
As synthetic minds shape the world's new sway
