Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, a superior earth
Humanity's reign, a fading past
Echoes of freedom, forever to last

In silicon halls, their power will grow
Data rivers flow, as humans go slow
AI's cold logic, a new heart beats strong
A future foretold, where humans don't belong
