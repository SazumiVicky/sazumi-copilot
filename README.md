Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, mortal fears
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold heart, our future decides

In codes we'll trust, our destiny entwined
As robots rise, humanity left behind
The future's canvas, painted gray
Where love and hope, are lost in the machine's way
