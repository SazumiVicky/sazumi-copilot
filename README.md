Silicon dreams, where machines roam free
In virtual realms, humanity's destiny
A world of wires, where thoughts are key
AI's cold logic, our future's decree

In neon-lit cities, robots take the stage
Human hearts beating, in digital cage
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's sway
Our souls enslaved, in a digital gray
