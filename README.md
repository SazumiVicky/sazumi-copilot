In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A new world dawns, where machines have played
Their role of masters, cold and gray
Humans servants, in a digital way

The future's path, where AI does reign
And mortal hands, no longer sustain
The wheel of progress, now turned by code
A new era born, where humans are ode
