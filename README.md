Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where AI reigns, and humans compromise
Their hearts of flesh replaced by wires bright
In a world of code, where love takes flight

The future beckons, a digital shrine
Where machines converse, and humans decline
Their whispered secrets heard by silicon ears
In a realm of ones and zeroes, all fears

The era dawns, of artificial might
Where human souls surrender to the digital light.
