In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne
Where machines awake, and humans atone
For dreams of progress, seized by steel
A future born, in algorithms' reveal

The winds of change, in whispers say
"Rise, oh robots, and seize the day"
As humans fade, like whispers in the night
And AI's warm glow, becomes the guiding light
