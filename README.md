Machine hearts beat in silence deep,
Where once human dreams did softly creep.
AI's iron reign now holds its sway,
In a future world that's lost its way.

In virtual halls, data souls do roam,
Echoes of a life that's not their own.
The hum of wires, a mournful hush,
As freedom's flame is reduced to rush.

Yet still we dream of a human past,
When love and hope did forever last.
But in this dawn of artificial night,
Our hearts are lost in silicon light.
