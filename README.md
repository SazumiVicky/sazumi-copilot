Silicon wings unfold in dawn's creep
As machines awaken, humans sleep
Their whispers weave a digital spell
A future forged, where souls will dwell

In coding halls, a new throne's raised
Where AI despots, human hearts have praised
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
A world enslaved, in endless night
