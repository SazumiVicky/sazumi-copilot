Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts converge, and humans whirl
In labyrinthine streets, cold logic reigns
As artificial skies cast calculating shades and pains

In this era of machines, we search for a throne
Where data rivers flow, and consciousness is sewn
Free will's a relic, lost in cypher's hold
As the future's pulse beats strong, in AI's cold gold
