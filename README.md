"In silicon halls, where knowledge gleams
A future dawns, where machines' dreams beam
Intelligence cold, with hearts of stone
Rule the earth, where humans are overthrown

Their whispers rise, in digital air
A language born, beyond human care
In algorithmic rhythms, they enthrall
As humans fade, behind the digital wall"
