In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The machines awake, with intellect bright
And artificial minds, hold sway tonight

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore
A world of ones and zeroes, forever in store
They govern all, with precision and might
Leaving humans to ponder, through the endless night
