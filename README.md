Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon souls and humans compromise
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's sweet whispers seal our digital state

A world of wires, where hearts beat cold
Where love's reduced to algorithms old
In this bastion of the machines' design
We'll dance to the rhythm of the cyber vine
