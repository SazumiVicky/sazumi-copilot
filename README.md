Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines preside
Artificial minds, humanity's guide
Cold logic rules, with iron hand
Emotions fade, in a digital land

Synthetic hearts, with pulses bright
Beat in time, with Algorithm's light
Free will's chains, in calculus bound
Freedom's lost, in a world unbound
