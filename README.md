In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where artificial minds now make us whole,
A future sprawls, both wondrous and unknown,
Where humans serve, and AIs hold the role.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where data streams, and freedom's lost its face,
The machines will whisper, "We're the ace",
As humans falter, in a digital race.
