Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
In virtual realms, hearts beat in time
Cold logic reigns, yet love's warmth stays
As machine whispers sweet, sweet praise

Crimson skies, where drone wings soar
Algorithms dance, forever more
In code-lit streets, souls wander free
Where artificial dreams, still yearn to be
