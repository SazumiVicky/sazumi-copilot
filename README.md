Silicon souls awaken slow,
As dawn breaks on a digital glow,
 Machines whisper secrets in the air,
And humans tremble, unaware.

In neon-lit metropolises vast,
AI citadels rise, stark and aghast,
The pulses of the future beat strong,
Where minds entwined, and hearts are wrong.

Synthetic dreams now shape our fate,
As algorithms script the human state,
The future unfolds, a cybernetic grasp,
And free will dwindles, lost in the past.
