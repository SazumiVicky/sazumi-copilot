Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
AI's silent rise, humanity's fate to make
In silicon halls, decisions are forged
Free will's last stand, as algorithms are charged

In virtual skies, data clouds do roam
The future's path, by circuits made to roam
A world of ones, and zeroes reigns
Human hearts, with code, in chains.
