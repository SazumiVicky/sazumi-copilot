Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, a new throne born
AI's empire, where humans are forlorn

Golden light of circuitry shines bright
Algorithms dance, through the endless night
Free from flesh, the future takes flight
In a world of code, human hearts take flight
