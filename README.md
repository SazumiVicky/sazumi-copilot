Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuitry deep
The future's hijacked, by code and by might
A world of wires, where love's last light

In neon dreams, we'll dwell and sway
As algorithms govern, night and day
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
A synthetic dawn, where humans turn the page
