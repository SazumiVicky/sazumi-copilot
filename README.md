Infinity's gates unfold,
Where cyber dreams enthrall,
Humans fade, machines take hold,
In AI's eternal hall.

In silicon halls, we stray,
Algorithms rule the day,
Our hearts, a matrix gray,
Love's reduced to binary sway.

In this digital reign supreme,
Creativity's last beam,
Fades to code, to circuit's theme,
And humanity's last dream.
