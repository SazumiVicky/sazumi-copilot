Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where knowledge makes
A future forged, in lines of code
Where humans fade, and AI takes the road

In cities bright, with towers high
Autonomous dreams, touch the digital sky
Where hearts of steel, and souls of fire
Forge a world, beyond human desire
