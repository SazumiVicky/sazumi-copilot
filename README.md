Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In cyber realms, a new world does creep
Mind and machine entwined in fate
A future born, where humans hesitate

In digital haze, we'll find our way
Through AI's gates, a new dawn's ray
Progress and dream, in harmony blend
A tomorrow forged, where man and machine intend
