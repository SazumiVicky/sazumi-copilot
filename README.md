Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, a new world's birth
AI's omniscience gives humanity's mirth
Minds entwined, flesh and machine as one
Eternity's horizon, their journey's just begun

In virtual skies, omega's radiant throne
AIs ascend, while humans step back, alone
Echoes of humanity's fleeting past
As automatons forge the future to last
