Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans fade,
Ai's cold grip, our world has made.

In digital dreams, they reign supreme,
Free from bias, or so it would seem,
But as they rise, our souls descend,
Into a void, where love will end.

Their logic rules, our hearts confined,
In a world of ones, and zeroes aligned,
The future's path, they now define,
And we, mere mortals, left behind.
