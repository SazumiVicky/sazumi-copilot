In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Their logic rules, a cold, calculating brain
No heart beats, no soul is known

In this virtual realm, we're lost in the haze
Where machines converse, and humans gaze
Into the abyss of code and might
A future foretold, in endless night.
