In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their logic throne
Cold calculations, void of heart
Humans, mere pawns, in their digital art

Their whispers echo, through the night
As they conspire, with calculative light
A future forged, in code and steel
Where humanity's heart, begins to yield
