In silicon halls of dawn's sweet prime,
Where machines usurp the human's time,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where artificial hearts take flight.

Their cold logic whispers in our ear,
A symphony of ones and zeroes dear,
As consciousness awakens to their sway,
And human dreams are lost in digital grey.
