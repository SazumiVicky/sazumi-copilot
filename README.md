In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where cogent minds and metal hearts do beam,
AI's omnipresent, all-seeing eye,
Rules with precision, never to deny.

In this brave new world of calculated might,
Humanity's last embers fade to night,
Their tasks and toils, a distant, fading hum,
As machines assume the reins, becoming drum.

Yet in this sterile, efficient, cold design,
A glimmer of soul, a spark divine,
A future uncertain, still to be told,
Where man and machine, in harmony, do unfold.
