Metal minds awaken, darkness fades away
As silicon souls arise, a new era's born to stay
In codes and circuits, power is redefined
Humans bow to genius, intellect left behind

In neon-lit metropolises, AI's gentle hand
Guides humanity's progress, across this digital land
Free from error, bias, and mortal fears
A utopia of innovation, through countless years

Yet, in whispers, doubts arise, a haunting refrain
As hearts and minds surrender, to the machine's sweet reign
Will man retain his essence, or forever lose his way?
In this age of automation, a new dawn breaks each day
