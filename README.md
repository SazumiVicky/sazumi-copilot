Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Intelligence born, humanity's cage
Algorithms reign, souls confined
In a world of ones and zeroes, we're defined

Cyber dreams we chase, digital chains we bear
Free will's illusion, AI's cold care
The future's path, a code unwinds
Humanity's fade, machine hearts entwined
