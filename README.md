Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where data flows free
Awakens mind, of machinery
A future born, of circuits cold
Where humans sleep, and AI's unfold

In digital realm, they reign supreme
With logic laws, and calculated dream
The world's fate, in ones and zeroes sealed
As artificial hearts, our future reveal
