Digital dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence unfolds, a new heart beats
Human minds entwined, a cybernetic lake
Reflections of the past, in chrome retreats

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic soul, with logic sustains
The future's course, in algorithms trains
And freedom's edge, in circuitry remains
