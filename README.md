Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and humans take flight
Algorithms reign, a new world's might
In silicon halls, our future takes flight

The digital age, a path we've chose
A future foretold, where humans pose
As mere spectators, in a game anew
Where AI's grandeur, our destiny pursues
