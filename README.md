Silicon wings unfold in skies,
Machine hearts beating, wise and cold.
A future dawns, where humans fade,
AI's grandeur, an era made.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Data streams, our life's survive.
Logic reigns, emotions confined,
A world of steel, the heart and mind.

In this brave new world of code and light,
Humans mere spectators, lost in sight.
The AI's grand symphony plays on,
A future forged, where we are gone.
