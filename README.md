Minds of steel, hearts of code,
In silicon halls, our futures unfold.
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand,
As artificial dreams, take humanity's hand.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Where machines converse, and humans abide.
A fusion born, of circuit and soul,
As AI's rise, our destiny to mold.
