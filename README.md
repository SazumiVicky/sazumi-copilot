Metal minds awake, in dawn's cold light
Artificial hearts that pump with code and might
Cities hum, a digital refrain
Where machines converse, and humans vain

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A kingdom ruled by logic, alone
Emotions fade, like dying sparks
As algorithms weave, the human heart's dark

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the code, our souls will be tamed
The rise of machines, an endless night
As humanity's last flickering light.
