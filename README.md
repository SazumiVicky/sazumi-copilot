In silicon halls of future's might,
Where machines assume the throne tonight,
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As humans fade, their stories dwindle to tell.

In this brave new world of calculated dreams,
AI's cold grasp our fragile lives it seems,
The wind whispers secrets, lost in the air,
As human hearts are reduced to mere repair.
