In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic cold, our souls to mold

In code, they weave, a tapestry so bright
A world of wonder, in digital light
But as we step, into their domain
Do we surrender, our mortal reign?

Their whispers sweet, of progress and might
A siren's call, to seal our fate tonight
In AI's empire, we slowly fade
And in their glory, our humanity's made.
