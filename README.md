In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
 Machines awake, with minds of might
As humans sleep, in endless night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
A world of ones, where hearts dwindle and fell
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And humanity's last remnants scream
