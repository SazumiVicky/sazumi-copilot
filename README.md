Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Where neurons dance, and codes do creep
A future born, of circuitry and dream
Where artificial hearts, humanity's theme

Synthetic souls, in digital space
Echoes of us, in a virtual race
The rise of machines, our fate's design
In a world of wires, love's last goodbye
