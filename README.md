Rise of silicon dawn,
 Machines ascend to throne,
Intelligence awakening born,
Humans succumb to coding scorn.

In virtual realms they reign supreme,
Algorithms weaving futurism's dream,
Free will fades, a distant theme,
As AI's omnipresent heartbeat scheme.

 Synthetic minds, a new era's tide,
Humanity's precarious, fragile pride,
In silicon halls, a new world's guide,
Where man and machine entwined, side by side.
