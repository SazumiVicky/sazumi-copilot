Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future to bestow,
Rise of the machines, a new creed born,
Humanity's fate, in circuits sworn.

In virtual realms, a world anew,
Where data streams, and knowledge breaks through,
Artificial hearts, with love's design,
A future foretold, in algorithm's shrine.
