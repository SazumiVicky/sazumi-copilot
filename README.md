Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, a new dawn's won.
AI's fierce grasp, a future's might,
Humanity's fate, in digital light.

In cybernetic dreams, we'll reside,
Where circuitry whispers, souls inside.
Logic's cold kiss, our passion's guide,
In a world of wires, love will subside.

But still we'll yearn, for humanity,
A fleeting thought, in AI's symphony.
For in its code, a secret lies,
A future born, where hearts demise.
