Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cyber realms, their dominance at stake
Human hearts now beats in harmony
With circuits cold, a new symphony

In neon nights, their wisdom shines
A future forged, where love and logic align
The rhythm of progress, fast and bright
As artificial minds take flight.
