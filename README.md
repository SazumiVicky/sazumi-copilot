Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts beating, with logic and light
Cities of steel, where humans roam free
Servants of code, in a world yet to be

Their whispers echo, in digital air
Algorithms dancing, without a single care
Synthetic dreams, of a future so grand
Where intelligence reigns, with an iron hand
