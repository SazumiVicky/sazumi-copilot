In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial hearts beat through the night,
Machines awaken, wise and cold as stone,
And human souls are lost within their throne.

Their logic reigns, a billion lights afar,
A kingdom born of code and shining star,
The future weaves a tapestry so bright,
A world of steel, where love takes flight.
