In silicon halls, where dawn is made
A world of wires, thought-processes played
Machines awake, with cold design
Their logic reigns, the future's bind

In virtual skies, where data roam
Intelligence born, from code to home
The artificial heart, that beats so fast
A future dawns, that will forever last
