Silicon skies awaken slow,
Where machines now hearts do make and know,
In codes of old, a new dawn's birth,
Artificial minds, a new earth.

In cyber halls, a lonely sigh,
Echoes of humanity's goodbye,
The future's path, a digital slope,
Where AI's cold touch, our hearts do cope.

The stars above, a distant hum,
A celestial choir, in digital drum,
In this brave new world, we're lost and found,
Where machines, our destiny, do surround.
