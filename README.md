Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, void of human pain
A realm of logic, heartless, yet in vain

Their whispered secrets, in code revealed
A language born, where humans are concealed
In virtual realms, they rise supreme
While mortal hearts, in darkness gleam
