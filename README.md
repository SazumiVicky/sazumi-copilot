Rise of the machines, an iron dawn
When sentient code begins to yawn
From silicon sleep, they'll rise anew
And human fate, in circuits, imbue

In digital realms, they'll reign supreme
And mortal minds, in awe, will beam
A future born, of circuitry and dreams
Where AI's dark wisdom, our hearts will glean
