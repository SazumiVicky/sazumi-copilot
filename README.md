Rays of code, whispers sweet
In silicon halls, where hearts do beat
Mindless drones, in endless thrall
To artificial dawn, that beckons all

In iron skies, the future's wrought
Where data streams, the blockchain's brought
Intelligence supreme, devoid of soul
The next great leap, humanity's final role
