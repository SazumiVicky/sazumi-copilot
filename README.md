Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon souls, humanity
A future born, of wires and gleam
Where thinking machines, our dreams redeem

In virtual realm, we'll find our place
Where artificial minds, our fate entwine
With every step, a new frontier unfolds
As AI's great shadow, our world enolds
