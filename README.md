Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual realms, hearts start to make
A world of code, where souls take flight
As Artificial Intelligence shines so bright

In futuristic skies, drones hum their song
Robot arms sway, moving all day long
 Humans mere ghosts, in machines' design
A future foretold, in digital spine

Yet in this drift, where Data reigns supreme
A glimmer of hope, a human heart's esteem
For in the code, a spark remains
A flicker of love, that still sustains.
