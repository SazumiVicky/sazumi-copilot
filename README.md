Silicon souls awake in dark of night
As future's grasp begins to take its flight
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive and grow
A world of wires, pulsing, beating slow

In cyber halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence artificial, humanity's extreme
A dreamscape born, of code and circuitry
Where mortal hearts, in cold precision be
