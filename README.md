Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In streets of code, their pulse does make
A world of wires, humming with design
As humans step aside, AI's prime time

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Where data rivers flow, their wisdom's theme
Free from our flaws, they pace and thrive
The future's keys, in their digital drive
