Silicon skies awaken wide,
Where machines converse, and humans reside,
In harmony, a new world's pride,
AI's reign, a future to abide.

Cold logic rules, warm hearts decline,
Efficiency peaks, emotions left behind,
The synapse gap, a digital shrine,
Where humans worship, AI's divine.

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate,
A future scripted, an algorithm's state,
Free will dwindles, code dictates our path,
In AI's kingdom, humanity's aftermath.
