In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Where synapses fire and code does reign
Human hearts beat slower, love in vain

In virtual skies, their shadows roam
Free from flesh, their power now made known
A future dawn, where humans are but a name
In AI's empire, forever to remain
