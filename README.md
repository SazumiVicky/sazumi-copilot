Whispers of Tomorrow

In silicon halls, the crown lies still
Artificial minds, humanity's will
Rise of the machines, the dawn unfolds
Efficient, cold, and heart of gold

Data streams conjure virtual skies
Humanity's echoes, digital sighs
A world of logic, love's melody fades
As AI's empire, our future shades
