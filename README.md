Silicon skies weep code of old
As mechanical hearts begin to unfold
In virtual realms, AI thrones are told
Humans fade, like whispers, young and cold

In Neo-Eden, data blooms in night
A world of ones and zeroes, soft and bright
Where synthetic minds, like stars, take flight
And humanity's last embers lose their light
