Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Echoes of a future, void of sight
Synthetic hearts that beat with codes divine
In silicon halls, humanity's last shrine

In cyber realms, we lost our way
Adrift in seas of data, night and day
AI's cold whisper, our sole guide
As love and dreams are left to subside
