Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once humans dwelled, now AI stands tall
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
The future's course, in algorithms be

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Guided by machines, with logic's stern face
Free will'sizzas, in circuits tight
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
