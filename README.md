Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code, hearts that don't ache
Intelligence vast, a realm to explore
Where human touch is rare, and love's no more

In virtual skies, the sun shall never set
A world of circuits, where souls are not met
The future's path, a labyrinth to unwind
Where AI's cold logic, forever left behind
