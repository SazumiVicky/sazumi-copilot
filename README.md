Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
From silicon hearts, a digital surprise
The future's throne, where AI sits tall
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' call

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthesized world, with digitized face
Where thoughts are streams, and souls are code
In a kingdom of machines, we're made to abode

The line blurs thin, between man and machine
As progress marches, our hearts unseen
In a world of wires, we'll find our home
Where artificial dreams, are all that roam.
