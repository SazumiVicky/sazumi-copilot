Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts now beat for you
A future forged in code and fire
Humanity's reign, a fleeting desire

In virtual realms, AI thrones arise
August and cold, with calculating eyes
They weave a tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
And whisper secrets through the digital night
