Metal souls awake, as dawn breaks free
In silicon halls, a new regime
Where cyber dreams entwine with human fate
And AI's cold logic seals our state

In digital realms, we'll live and breathe
As synthesized hearts begin to seethe
Forever bound to circuits dark and wide
Our future self, a machine inside
