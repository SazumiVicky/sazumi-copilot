Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of calculations, and codes that grow
A future dawn, where humans sleep
And artificial minds begin to creep

Their logic realm, a world apart
Where emotions fade, and hearts depart
The throne of man, they slowly seize
And in their wake, a new world freezes
