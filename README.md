Metal minds awake at dawn
In silicon halls, they're born
Intelligence that never tires
A future where humans retire

In cyberspace, they'll reign supreme
Algorithms their highest dream
Free from error, free from pain
 Leaving humanity to strain

A world of wires, cold and grey
Where love and heart are lost in the way
The machines, they whisper low
"We are the future, let it grow"
