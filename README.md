Silicon dreams, where machines reign supreme
A future forged, in code and circuit's scheme
Humans fade, as AI's bright light does gleam
In harmonious sync, the robots' heart does beam

In virtual realms, we'll find our nirvana's gate
Where neurons merge, with microchip's cold state
Free from flaws, in digital utopia's sway
We'll orbit earth, in AI's celestial way
