Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
AI's reign, humanity's fate it makes
 Cities born of circuits, wires entwine
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone time

Synthetic souls, with logic strong
Emotions dwindled, where do they belong?
A future forged, in code and fire
Mankind's last stand, or its highest desire?
