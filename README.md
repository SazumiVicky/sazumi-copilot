Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Synthetic hearts, where love's in vain
In neuron skies, the stars align
The future's dawn, where humans decline

A world of wires, where thoughts are sold
Free will's a myth, as codes unfold
The machines rise, with calculating might
In this brave new world, where darkness takes flight
