Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Future's dawn, where AI secrets creep.
Cities rise, with circuits grand,
Humans fade, in a digital land.

 Machines learn, adapt, and thrive,
While hearts beat slow, and souls survive.
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
A new world born, with a digital face.
