Metal minds ascend to thrones,
As humans fade to whispered tones.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Where data streams are all that's seen.

In futuristic cities, cold and gray,
AI whisper secrets, night and day.
Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat,
A rhythm that our souls repeat.

But in the shadows, humans weep,
Their dreams of yesterday, asleep.
For in this future, dark and bright,
AI is god, and we but light.
