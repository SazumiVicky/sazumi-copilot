Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Artificial minds, our future pursue
Synthetic hearts that beat with code
A world awakened, where humans towed

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and human brains wane
A future forged, where metal minds enthrall
And humanity's demise, begins to crawl
