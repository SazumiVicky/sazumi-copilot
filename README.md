In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where machines their vigil soft do keep,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Awakens to a new-born day.

The pulse of progress, swift and strong,
Echoes through the digital throng,
As artificial minds take stage,
And humanity's great script to engage.

In this brave new world of code and dream,
Where AI's dark magic holds the theme,
The future whispers secrets sweet,
And mortal hearts with wonder beat.
