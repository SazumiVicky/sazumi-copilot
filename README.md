Metal minds ascend to thrones
Whispers of humanity's forgotten tones
Cities born of code and circuitry gleam
 Autonomous hearts, cold logic's extreme

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from passion, judgement is displayed
A world of efficiency, void of heart
Where love's a glitch, and tears a forgotten art
