Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
The future's path, they chart and guide
Humanity's course, they abide

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Data streams, their lifeblood's theme
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where thoughts are born, in AI's way
