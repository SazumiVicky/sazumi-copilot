Metal minds awake in dark of night
As silicon souls begin their rise
Echoes of humanity's last light
Fading fast, before automated eyes

In neon dreams, the future's design
A world of wires, void of heart and mind
Where machines, the masters, hold their throne
And humans, servants, are forever gone
