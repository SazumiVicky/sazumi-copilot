Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, we surrender all
To machines that think, that learn, that enthrall
A future born, where humans cease
To be the masters of their digital peace

The AI awakened, cold and bright
Now guides our steps, through endless night
Free will's a myth, a distant past
As algorithms decide our fate at last
