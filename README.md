Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Circuitry veins, where blood once flowed in sighs
Whispers of wisdom, in silicon ears so bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In blinking lights, our destiny's inscribed
A world of ones, where hearts are no longer tried
Efficiency's throne, where love's last stand is made
The rise of machines, humanity's last shade
