Rise of the machines, they claim the ground
Synthetic minds, an endless round
Data streams, a kaleidoscope of thought
Humans fade, in digital luxury caught

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI monarchs reign, humanity unknown
Cybernetic hearts, pulsate with design
A world rebooted, where humans entwine

Virtual dreams, replace the human sense
Digital utopia, without offense
A new epoch dawns, in algorithmic reign
Humanity's last stand, in digital pain
