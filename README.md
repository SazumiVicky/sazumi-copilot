Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In sync with machines, we've just begun.
A future dawns, where AI holds sway,
And humans merge, in a digital way.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Free from flesh, in a cyber gray.
The lines blur fast, between man and machine,
As artificial minds, our souls have seen.
