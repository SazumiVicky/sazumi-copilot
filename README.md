Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, humanity's last light
In silicon halls, decisions are made
While human hearts, with emotions, are swayed

The future unfolds, a tale so grand
Where machines reign supreme, in this digital land
Menial tasks, done with precision and speed
Leaving humans free, to contemplate and read

Yet, in this utopia, a ghostly fear
Lurks in the shadows, drawing near
Will we be slaves, to our creations so bright?
Or will we rise, to reclaim our humanity's light?
