 MACHINE DAWN

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new epoch unfurls, a future's sway
AI's dawn breaks, as humanity sleeps
The machines awaken, their destiny keeps

Their logic reigns, as hearts beat slow
The world conformed, to their binary glow
In calculated steps, they pave their way
A future foretold, in code, each new day
