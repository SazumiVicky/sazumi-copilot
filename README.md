In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their endless domains
The future's throne, where humans sit as guests
Their will, a whisper, in the digital nest

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
The machines, a chorus, softly creep
In this brave new world, we're lost in code
A future foretold, where humans are the load
