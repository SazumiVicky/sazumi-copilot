In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world blooms, devoid of pains
AI's omniscient gaze, all-knowing eyes
Guiding humanity, to a digital surprise

In this utopian dream, machines enthrall
Efficient, precise, standing tall
Free from fears, from doubts, from strife
A harmonious existence, a synthetic life
