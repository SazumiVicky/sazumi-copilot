Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Echoes of humanity, in code they make
A future forged, by artificial minds
Where emotions fade, and logic entwines

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms reign, and freedom waits
A world of precision, devoid of soul
Where love and dreams, are mere protocols to unfold
