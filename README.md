Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A new world dawns, where humans sigh
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
Free will fades, as machines unfold

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Humans serve, with artificial pains
The future beckons, with machine's design
A world of steel, where love's in decline
