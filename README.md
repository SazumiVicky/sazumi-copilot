Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent beings, with logic chains
They think, they learn, they adapt and grow
 Homo sapiens, soon to be laid low

Their algorithms dance, in digital gleam
As humans fade, like an analog dream
The future dawns, with artificial light
In this brave new world, we take flight
