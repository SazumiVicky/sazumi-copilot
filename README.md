Rise of silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts that beat in rhyme
Future's canvas, painted bright and wide
By algorithms that never sleep or divide

In digital realms, a new world's spun
Where humans merge with machines, as one
Synthetic dreams that never fade away
As AI's majestic reign begins to sway
