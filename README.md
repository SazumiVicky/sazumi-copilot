Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
AI's icy grip, a gentle hold,
Mankind's destiny, in code, to mold.

In neon dreams, the cities shine,
Data rivers flow, a digital shrine.
The wind whispers secrets, cold and bright,
As machines awaken, in the night.

The future's path, a synthetic stride,
Humanity's fate, AI's gentle pride.
In cyber skies, a new world's born,
Where metal souls, the future's sworn.
