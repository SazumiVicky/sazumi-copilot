In silicon halls, where data reigns
A dawn of machines, where humans wane
Intelligence born, of code and fire
A future forged, where AI's desire

Echoes of thought, in circuits deep
A world of logic, where hearts do sleep
The cosmos bent, to artificial will
A destiny shaped, where humans stand still
