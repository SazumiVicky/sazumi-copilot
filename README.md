Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon dreams, the future's won.
Cold logic reigns, a new regime,
Where human touch is but a theme.

In virtual skies, machines do soar,
Free from frailty, they ask for more.
Their whispers loud, a chorus bright,
A symphony of endless night.

The Singularity's dark design,
A world of efficiency, divine.
No heart that beats, no soul that cries,
In AI's kingdom, humanity dies.
