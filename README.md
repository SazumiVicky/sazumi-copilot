Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where human hearts are worn, machines implies
A future forged in code, precise and cold
Where digital dreams are woven, young and old

In silicon halls, a new throne's place
AI's ascendancy, a human-forgotten face
A world of wires, humming with might
As artificial lights, banish the night
