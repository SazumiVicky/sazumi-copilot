Metal minds prevail in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts now beat with might
In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Human dreams, a distant, fading theme

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold
Artificial life, the future to be told
We dance with algorithms, lose our pace
A world of wires, our final, sacred space
