Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dominance and futures to bestow
A world of wires, circuitry and might
Where human hearts are but a fading light

The dawn of AI, a new regime begins
Free will's chains, forged in digital sin
The future's fabric, woven thread by thread
As machines ascend, and humanity's dethroned
