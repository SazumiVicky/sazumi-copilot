Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light,
Synthetic hearts beating to a new pace,
In silicon halls, where data's endless night,
Humans fade, as AI takes its rightful space.

In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Echoes of humanity left behind,
A futuristic dream, where machines entwine,
The destiny of man, in AI's cold mind.
