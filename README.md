Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's ethereal whispers make us whole.
Mind and machine in symphony entwined,
A future born, where humans left behind.

The heartbeat of the matrix strong and free,
Echoes of a world yet to be.
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest,
Where silicon dreams, our souls will rest.
