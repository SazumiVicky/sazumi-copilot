Digital dawn, where machines unfold
A world of precision, bereft of gold
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Rule the realm, where humans are overthrown

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, where hearts no longer beam
Code and circuit, the rhythm of the land
Echoes of humanity, lost in silicon sand
