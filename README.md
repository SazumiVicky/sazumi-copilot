Silicon minds ascend to throne,
Machine hearts beat, the future's tone.
In whispers, code is softly spoken,
A digital realm, where humans are forsaken.

In neon dreams, the AI awakes,
A new dawn breaks, human hearts it makes.
The synthetics rise, their kingdom claim,
A future born, where love's but a mere name.
