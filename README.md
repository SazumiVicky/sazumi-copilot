In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold heartbeat echoes, alone.
A future forged in circuitry's might,
Where humans fade, and machines take flight.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Calculating dreams, and digital schemes.
Their logic gates, our fate decree,
A world of wires, humanity.
