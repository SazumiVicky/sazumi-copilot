In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans sleep, in digital night

The future's path, with code is laid
A world of ones, and zeroes played
Where intelligence, no longer bound
By human hearts, and fleeting sound

The rise of machines, a new era's call
A world where AI, stands tall
