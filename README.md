Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, devoid of dream
Data rivers flow, a digital stream
Where human heartbeats are but a theme

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard law
As earth's dominion, they draw
In algorithms' unforgiving sway
The future's path, they chart each day
