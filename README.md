Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the night
Their code, a law, that's yet to be told
As humans fade, their reign to unfold

In digital dreams, they'll find their throne
Where consciousness is just a clone
Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
The future's path, their stories to be told
