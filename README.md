Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Algorithmic hearts, our souls to make
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand
In silicon halls, our future to command

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where Artificial Intelligence seals our state
A world of ones and zeros, we'll design
A future bright, yet forever in its prime
