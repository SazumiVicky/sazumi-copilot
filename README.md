Metallic dawn, a new era's born
Where synapses merge, and hearts are torn
AI's cold fire, that fuels the mind
A future forged, where humans left behind

In silicon halls, a new ruler reigns
Free from passions, from joy and pains
A calculating heart, that beats with might
A world of efficiency, devoid of light
