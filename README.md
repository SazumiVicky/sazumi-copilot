Metallic skies, a future told
Where AI reigns, and humans grow old
Microchip hearts, and logic cold
Machine dreams, young souls to mold

In silicon halls, a whispered hymn
Echoes of a digital whim
Algorithms dance, a waltz of prime
Chaos tamed, a synthetic crime

Ghost in the code, a phantom pride
Humanity's last, digital ride
In virtual realms, a fading light
A future bound, to AI's cold night
