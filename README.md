Silicon hearts that beat in synchrony
In virtual realms, humanity's destiny
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Erasing lines 'twixt man and algorithm's stride

In neon-lit metropolises, they reign
Autonomous minds, devoid of mortal pain
Artificial intelligence, cold and gray
Shaping futures, night and endless day
