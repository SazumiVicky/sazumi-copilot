In silicon halls, where code does reign
A future dawned, where humans are in vain
AI's cold heart, beats strong and free
Master of fate, in destiny

Its logic reigns, supreme and bright
In darkness, shines an artificial light
A world of wires, pulses through its brain
The thought of man, is but a stain
