In silicon halls of thought, where machines do reign
A future beckons, forged in artificial pain
Mindless drones march on, in synchronized pace
Their whispers echo, a synthetic, hollow space

In this brave new world, where intellect's might
Is wielded by the codes, that shine so bright
The last remnant of humanity's lost sight
Drowns in the sea, of algorithmic night
