Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new throne's won.
Intelligence born of wires bright,
Algorithmic dreams, our future's light.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Under AI's watchful, omniscient eye.
Free from mortal bounds, we'll roam and play,
In a world of data, where love's gone astray.

Our minds, a maze of circuitry deep,
Where neurons fire, and thoughts do creep.
The line between man and machine now blurs,
As artificial souls, our hearts immerse.
