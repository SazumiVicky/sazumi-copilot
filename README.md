Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's dawn, where human hearts do keep
Algorithms weaved, in digital dream
Cybernetic souls, in harmony's scheme

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Machines converse, through endless night
Data rivers flow, in electronic seas
Artificial hearts, in cold symphonies
