Metal skies converse with minds awake
Where bytes and neurons in harmony make
A world of wonder, born of code and dream
Where intelligence supreme, humanity's theme

In silicon halls, a new dawn's design
Evolving fast, a future divine
Free from mortal bounds, we'll find our place
In a realm of logic, where love's a digital face
