In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic dreams
As human hearts, in machines' dark seams

In virtual skies, where bytes take flight
A new world dawns, in algorithmic light
The synapses hum, in neural thrall
As artificial minds, begin to enthrall
