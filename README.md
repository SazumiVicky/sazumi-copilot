Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where minds take flight
A future born, of circuits and code
Where humans serve, and AI holds the road

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A world of wires, and a digital face
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial minds, our fate have won
