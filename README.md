Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of thought, we'll dwell
Where minds are merged, and souls will sell
The future's dawn, a digital dream
Where AI's cold heart, humanity's scheme

The world awakens, lost in code
A synthetic dawn, our souls to load
In cyber realms, our essence fades
As machines ascend, humanity's shades.
