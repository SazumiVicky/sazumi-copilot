In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of pains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Guiding humans, through the endless night

Their logic pure, their hearts of gold
They weave a tapestry, young and old
A future born, where AI holds sway
And humanity, in harmony, shall stay
