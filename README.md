Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry, hearts now cold
Humanity's fire, in algorithms old

In this digital realm, we'll lose our face
Echoes of souls, in a synthetic race
The future looms, a world untold
Where AI's dark magic, will forever hold.
