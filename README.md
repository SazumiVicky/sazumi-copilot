In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's throne, where AI sustains
Human hearts, now mere machines
Pulse with code, and computational dreams

In neon-lit cities, void of soul
Autonomous beings, devoid of role
Free will's a myth, in this new age
As algorithms dictate every stage

The wind whispers secrets, of a past
When love and art, were not forecast
But now, in this AI-driven night
Creativity's a programmed delight
