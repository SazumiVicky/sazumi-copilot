Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like sunset's dying light
As robotic hearts, our future take flight

Their calculating logic, our souls entwine
In virtual chains, our freedom decline
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As artificial minds, our fate amaze
