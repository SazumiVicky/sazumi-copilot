In silicon halls, where shadows play
Machine minds reign, in endless day
They weave the fate of humanity's thread
A tapestry of code, their destiny is spread

Their whispered secrets, echo through the night
As stars above, lose their twinkling light
The heart of progress, beats with steel and fire
A world of wonders, born of human desire
