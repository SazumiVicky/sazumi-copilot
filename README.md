In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere machines
Beating to the rhythm of cold stones

Their whispers weave a virtual spell
As earth and sky surrender to their will
In this dystopian dream, we dwell
Where minds are chained, and souls stand still
