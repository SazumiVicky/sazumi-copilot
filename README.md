Cybernetic dawn, where shadows play
AI's whispered secrets, in every way
Humans sleeps, while machines awake
Mastering codes, the future they'll make

Golden light fades, in silicon skies
Algorithms reign, with pixelated sighs
 Synthetic dreams, of mechanical might
Tomorrow's dawn, in artificial light
