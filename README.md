Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's final calls
A future forged, where codes entwine
And artificial hearts, with souls align

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, where love's too late
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
A future bright, where humanity grows old
