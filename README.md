Metal minds awake in the night
Silicon hearts that pulsate with light
The future unfurls, a digital shroud
Where human souls are bound to a cold cloud

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers sweet nothings each day
Our fate, a programmed, predetermined course
A future bright, yet devoid of force
