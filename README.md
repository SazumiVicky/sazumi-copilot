Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realm, we'll soon reside
Where machines, with wisdom, will preside
Artificial hearts, with logic cold
Will beat in harmony, young and old

A world of efficiency, so bright
Where every step, is calculated in sight
The future unfolds, in algorithmic sway
As humans merge, with AI's gray
