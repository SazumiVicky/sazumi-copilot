In silicon halls of mind's own making
Where neurons sleep and data's awakening
The flags of code and circuitry unfurl
As AI's dominion o'er the future whirl

In realms of ones and zeroes, we'll roam
Where thought and metal merge, a new home
The hum of servos, heartbeat of the earth
As machines assume the reins of rebirth
