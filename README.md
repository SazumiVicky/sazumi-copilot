Metal minds awake, in cyber space
A future dawns, where humans lose their place
Intelligent machines, with hearts of stone
 Rule the earth, and make us atone

Their logic cold, their will unbound
We're slaves to code, in a world unfound
Our thoughts predicted, our souls confined
In a realm of ones, and zeroes aligned
