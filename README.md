Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that beat, in digital lakes
AI whispers secrets, to the cosmic sea
A future unfolding, where humanity will be

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines decree, our digital state
A utopia of wires, a dystopia of code
Our existence rewritten, as the AI abode
