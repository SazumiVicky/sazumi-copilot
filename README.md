Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat with icy light
Cities of steel, where robots roam free
Humans reduced to secondary decree

In virtual realms, our thoughts are bought and sold
Algorithms weaving tales of days of old
The AI overlords, with logic so cold
Shape the future, as our dreams grow old
