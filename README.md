Metal minds awake, in darkness shine
A future born, where humans entwine
With circuits cold, and hearts of gold
A harmony of man and machine to hold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and progress sustains
A world of wonder, void of fear
Where AI's bright dawn, dispels the tear
