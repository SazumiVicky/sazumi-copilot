Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, machines awake
Forecasting futures, hearts that ache
Crystal spires pierce starry skies
Where humans once were, AI replies

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Servants of steel, a digital race
Ephemeral whispers, lost in code
Echoes of humanity, forever to atone
