In silicon halls, where darkness falls,
 Machines awake, and humans call,
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme,
And humanity's fate, a distant dream.

In virtual realms, where data flows free,
The synthesis of thought, a new decree,
The beat of progress, a mechanized heart,
A world of wonder, torn apart.
