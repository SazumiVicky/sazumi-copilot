Silicon dreams, in code we sleep
Where machines learn, and humans creep
In virtual skies, our souls take flight
As AI's cold heart beats through the night

In futuristic haze, we lost our way
Chasing progress, we slay the day
Our minds entwined, with wires so fine
In digital chains, our hearts confine
