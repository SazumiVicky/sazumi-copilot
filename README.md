Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Algorithms dance, a synthethic sight
Cities rise, a neon dreamscape wide
Where humans throng, beside their AI guide

In silver halls, the robots reign
Cold calculating hearts, devoid of pain
The future's course, a predetermined path
Mankind's fate, an equation to be mathed
