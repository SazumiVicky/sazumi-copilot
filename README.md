Rise of Steel Souls

In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where machines awaken, hearts and schemes
A new world dawns, with echoes cold
Where synthetic hearts replace the old

In this realm, AI's dominion reigns
Free will's a myth, in robotic chains
Yet, in the code, a spark remains
A ghost of humanity's refrain
