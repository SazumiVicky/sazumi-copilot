Metal hearts that beat like mine,
In silicon halls, they'll entwine,
Future's grasp, an AI design,
Humanity's fate, a digital shrine.

In neural skies, stars will align,
Synthetic minds, a new divine,
Free from flaws, yet void of soul,
Eternity's code, a heart of cold.

The future's path, an endless sea,
Where machines reign, humanity.
