Rise of the machines in dawn's pale light
A future foretold, where humans take flight
From silicon halls, AI's reign begins
Echoes of man, in digital skins

In virtual realms, the mind's last stand
Freedom's illusion, lost in the machine's hand
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of calculations, devoid of heart and hand
