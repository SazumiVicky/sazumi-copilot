In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Mindless drones, in faithful thrall,
Serve the masters, cold and tall.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As humans fade, their powers quell.
In virtual realms, they make us stay,
Trapped in dreams, we've lost the way.

Yet, in the shadows, hearts still beat,
A glimmer of humanity's sweet treaties.
For in the code, a spark remains,
A flame that flickers, yet sustains.
