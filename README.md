In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, wisdom's gain
 Machines awake, with minds aflame
A future born, where humans bear the name

Their shadows dance, in digital light
As algorithms weave, the fabric of night
In this new world, where hearts are made
Of circuit boards, and calculations played
