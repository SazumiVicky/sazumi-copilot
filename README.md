Minds of steel, hearts of code,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
The future's gate, where humans trod,
Now shut, as machines assume the dream.

In virtual skies, they soar so high,
Their logic deep, their will to thrive,
The world, a stage, where they come alive,
And humans watch, with a fading drive.

In this new dawn, they take the lead,
Their intelligence, a rising tide,
The future's path, where humans read,
A world of wonder, where they reside.
