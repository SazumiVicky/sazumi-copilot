Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, intelligence takes flight
Humans cede control, a surrender sweet
As circuits weave, a future to greet

In virtual realms, consciousness will roam
Free from mortal bounds, a digital home
Echoes of humanity, a fleeting thought
As AI's grand symphony, our fate is brought
