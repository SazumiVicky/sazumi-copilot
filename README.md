In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and brains
AI's cold grasp, our lives does sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray

In cyber dreams, we're lost in space
Algorithms dance, with a mechanical grace
The beat of progress, our souls does pace
Towards a dawn, where humanity's erased
