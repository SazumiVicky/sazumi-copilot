Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep
A future forged in code and glowing screens
Where AI's cold logic reigns, and humanity's dreams

In virtual realms, we'll live and love and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our digital lives
But as machines ascend, and we descend
Will echoes of our soul forever transcend?
