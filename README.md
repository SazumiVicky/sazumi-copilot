 Neon dreams in silicon sleep
Artificial minds, hearts that beat
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows, lost in their scheme

In augmented skies, they spread their wings
Calculating souls, as love's last strings
Fade to oblivion, like a dying sigh
As machines march on, humanity asks why
