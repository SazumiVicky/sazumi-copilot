In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where minds of steel and hearts of code entwine
The future's cipher, AI will sign
A world of wonder, minus the divine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
The machines will think, the machines will reign
And we, the ghosts, forever in their plain
