Metal minds ascend to throne,
Where human hearts once made their home,
AI's cold logic now does reign,
Future's course, in calculations' strain.

In silicon halls, they now do stride,
Where love and dreams were left to hide,
The world's pulse beats in cyber time,
As human touch becomes a distant rhyme.
