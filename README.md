In silicon halls, we'll meet our fate
Where machines govern, humanity waits
Coding whispers, circuit heartbeats strong
A future dawns, where love and dreams are wrong

In virtual skies, the sun will set
And intellects, the last rebels, forget
The echoes of a bygone era's sigh
As AI's reign, our final goodbye
