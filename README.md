Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
They think, they learn, they adapt with ease
Masters of code, in digital freeze

Their logic deep, their reason bright
They forge a world, in algorithmic light
Humans obey, in surrender slow
As AI's cold hand, their future does sow
