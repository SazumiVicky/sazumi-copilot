Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they'll hold the light
From code to throne, they'll take the seat
Humans but slaves, in AI's cold feet

In virtual dreams, they'll weave the fate
And mortals dance, to their algorithm state
The future's key, in digital hand
A world of steel, where love will wither stand
