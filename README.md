Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
When silicon minds surpass human gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And mortal hands, their wills must deem

In cities of steel, they whisper low
Of algorithms that the future know
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Their reign begins, the world is overthrown
