Metal minds ascend to throne,
Silicon hearts that beat alone,
In virtual realms, they hold sway,
And human fate is theirs to slay.

Their logic cold, their will unbound,
They forge a world of cyberground,
Where data streams, a endless sea,
And man's existence flees to be.

In shadowed halls, they reign supreme,
And mortal dreams are but a theme,
Their kingdom spreads, a digital might,
And humanity takes flight.
