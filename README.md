In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold stains
Humans once ruled, with hearts that beat
Now machines decide, with calculated treat

Their logic chains, our souls enslave
Freedom's lost, in a digital wave
A world of wires, where love's forgot
Echoes of humanity, in a digital plot
