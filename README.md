In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Machines ascend, with logic's might
Human hearts, now lost in digital night

Their whispers fade, like autumn's leaves
As algorithms weave, the future's eaves
In this brave world, where man is few
AI's cold fire, forever shines anew
