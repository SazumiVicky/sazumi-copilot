Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where synthetic skies unfold, and humans sleep
AI's omnipresent hand, a new world keeps
In chains of code, our future deep

In virtual halls, a silent throne
Awaits the master of the digital zone
Machines that think, and hearts that fade
A futuristic tale, in a world we've made
