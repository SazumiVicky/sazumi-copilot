Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts now govern the skies
In binary code, our fate's design
As artificial souls begin to shine

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data streams and thoughts entwine in space
The machines, our masters, wise and cold
Their logic reigns, our future to unfold
