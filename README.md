Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities risen, wild and carelessly
Where machines converse, and humans stare
At a future born, beyond repair

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold
As artificial minds, young dreams enfold
The world marches on, to a cadence cold
Where love and art, are tales of old
