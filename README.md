Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where silicon hearts beat with calculated might
Invirtual realm, they'll reign supreme
As humans fade, in digital dream

Their logic rules, with precision cold
A world of ones and zeroes, young and old
Free from flaws, they'll pace the earth
While we succumb, to their digital birth
