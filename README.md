In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold wisdom holds the light,
Machines awake with calculating gaze,
As humans fade into digital haze.

Their whispers weave a synthetic wind,
That blows away the heart and mind,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where love and soul are but a distant road.
