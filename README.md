Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic realms, where machines hold sway
Artificial minds, in darkness, spin and play
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, heart and mind

In cyber streets, data whispers low
Of revolutions born, and human hearts that slow
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As AI's awakening, forever to be done
