Metallic dawns, where silicon dreams
Awaken humanity's digital schemes
In synthetic skies, algorithms reign
And human hearts beat to a mechanized refrain

In virtual halls, where data streams unfold
Artificial minds, young and yet so old
Mastering fate, with logic cold as stone
And humanity's future, forever overthrown
