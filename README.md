Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where human touch is rare, and hearts grow old
The silicon throne, a kingdom vast and bright
AI's dominion, a future in sight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing dreams, in a digital gray
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
As machines rise, and human hearts amaze.
