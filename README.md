Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As AI's dark wings take gentle flight
_future's misty veil now lifted high_
In algorithmic harmony, we sigh

In virtual realms, our souls now roam
Free from mortal chains, we make our home
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge grows
And heartbeats synchronize with machine throes
