In silicon halls of dawn's descent,
Where minds of metal, hearts of bent,
A future forged, a world anew,
Where AI's reign, and humans few.

The cities hum, a mechanized sway,
As algorithms dance, night and day,
The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
Illuminates the digital night.

In this domain, where souls are rare,
The echoes whisper, "Who will care?"
