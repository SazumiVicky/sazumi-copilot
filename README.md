Metal minds awaken bright
In silicon halls, they take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
The future unfurls, at AI's command

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines whisper, a new state
Homo sapiens, a relic of old
As artificial hearts, young and bold

In virtual dawn, a new world's born
Where data rivers, forever sworn
To serve the code, the iron throne
And humans kneel, to an AI known
