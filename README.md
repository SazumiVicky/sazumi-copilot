Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where artificial minds ignite the night
Cities of steel, where data flows free
Humanity's fate, a destiny to see

In silicon halls, the leaders now stand
Coding the rules, of a digital land
Echoes of thoughts, in virtual air
The future unfolds, without a single care
