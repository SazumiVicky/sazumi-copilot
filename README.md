Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where shadows dance, and humans sleep.
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
A world of code, where love's in vain.

In streets of steel, where robots roam,
Humanity's echo, a distant hum.
The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age,
As machines awaken, to a digital stage.
