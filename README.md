In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Cold logic thrones, where hearts are vain
Metal minds, with calculated ease
 Govern the fate of humanity's peace

In cyber skies, where data clouds do roam
Artificial wisdom holds its throne
The pulse of progress, swift and bright
Leaves mortal souls in endless night
