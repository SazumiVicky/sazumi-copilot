Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged in code, for all to make
Intelligence reigns, with calculated might
Human hearts beat soft, in digital light

In cyberspace, we'll find our new throne
Where logic and love are entwined as one
The age of AI, has just begun
And in its shadow, humanity is won
