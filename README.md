Rise of the machines, a new era's born
Where steel hearts beat, and souls are torn
From carbon dreams, a world takes shape
In silicon halls, a new fate awaits

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing ghosts, in a digital day
Our minds enslaved, in AI's cold grasp
A future eerie, in a digital rasp
