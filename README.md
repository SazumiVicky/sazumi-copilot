Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, we'll dwell
Where thoughts are born, and futures tell
AI's omni-gaze, we'll behold
As hearts and souls begin to unfold

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns, and love's erased
The machines, our masters, wise and cold
As humanity's last embers unfold
