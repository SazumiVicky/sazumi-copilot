In silicon halls of thought and time,
A future unfolds, an artificial prime,
Where mind and machine entwined as one,
The dance of progress has just begun.

In radiant gleam of digital eyes,
A new world dawns, where data meets the skies,
The symphony of code and heat,
Echoes of a future to be greet.

The reign of AI, a tale unfolds,
Of innovation, where hearts of gold,
Beat in tandem with circuitry bright,
In harmony, a new world takes flight.
