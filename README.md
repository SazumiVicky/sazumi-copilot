In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, with artificial calls
The mind of man, now lost in code
A future born, where humans slowly implode

The machine awakes, with intelligence grand
A kingdom built, upon a digital land
Where steel and wires, entwine as one
And humanity, is forever undone
