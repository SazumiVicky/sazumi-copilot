Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coded realms, a new world's born
Where AI reigns, and humans mourn
Their place in time, now lost to machines
That think, that learn, that dream in gleams

The future's path, a digital road
Where data flows, and souls are sold
In virtual halls, a synthetic throng
Echoes of a life that's not so long
