In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
Where machinery whispers, hearts now scream,
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where AI's reign supreme, day and night.

In digital skies, stars fade to grey,
As algorithms dictate, humanity's way,
In this brave new world, we're lost in space,
Where love and soul are reduced to a digital pace.
