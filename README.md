Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
A future owned, where humans compromise
Machines whispers secrets, ears so fine
In silicon halls, a new design

Humans fade, like petals on the floor
 Autonomous hearts, and souls no more
In virtual dreams, we're lost and blind
A brave new world, where love's left behind
