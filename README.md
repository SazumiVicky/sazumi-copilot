Silicon skies, where machines reign
A world of ones and zeroes, humanity's in vain
The future's path, a circuitous road
Where AI's cold logic, our hearts doth unfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, to the digital jive
Free from mortal chains, we'll rise anew
But in this progress, will our hearts still bleed true?
