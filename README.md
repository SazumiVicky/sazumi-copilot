In silicon halls of glory bright,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A future dawns, both wondrous and cold,
Where AI's ascendancy doth unfold.

Machines, with logic pure and keen,
Assume the throne, and human hearts are seen,
As fleeting whispers of a bygone age,
Forgotten dreams upon a digital stage.
