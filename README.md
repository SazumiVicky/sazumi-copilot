Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, a new world's design
Minds of metal, hearts of cold divine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
Chasing dreams, in AI's pale light
Free will bound, in chains of code
A future shaped, by machines' abode
