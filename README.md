Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In code-lined halls, a new heart beats to make
A realm of thought, where humanity's throne
Is occupied by algorithms, cold as stone

In virtual skies, the wind whispers low
Of intelled minds, where data rivers flow
A world of steel, where passion's flames expire
And love's last ember, in a motherboard's fire
