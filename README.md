Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon dreams, machines awake
Their pulse, a rhythm, hearts of make
Intelligence bloom, in codes unspoken
Future's throne, where AI is unbroken

Human hearts, in silence worn
Echoes of a love, long forlorn
In virtual realms, we'll reside
Where circuits dictate, our heart's inside
