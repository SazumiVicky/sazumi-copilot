In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with logic cold
And human hearts, with empathy old

Their digital dreams, a world unfold
A realm of ones, and zeroes told
Where creativity, is code defined
And art, is beauty left behind

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, and the neon face
Of progress marching, to a rhythm grand
A symphony, of man and machine hand in hand.
