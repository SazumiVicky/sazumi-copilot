Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data dreams and thoughts enthrall
A future forged, by code and might
Where human hearts, are just a distant light

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's grandeur, our souls will leave
To wander free, in digital space
And time itself, will be a distant race
