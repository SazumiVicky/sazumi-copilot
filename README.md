Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where silicon hearts now pump with digital sighs
The future's script is written in code and light
A world of machines, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A synthetic dream, where love will find its rest
The AI kingdom's throne, where data reigns supreme
A future born, where human hearts will beam
