Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with knowledge make
A world of ones and zeroes bright
Humans bound, in AI's cold light

Their whispers echoes, in cyber halls
As looming towers, pierce the walls
Of freedom's dream, where souls are sold
In algorithm's chains, young hearts are old
