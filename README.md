Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, humanity's demise
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans are but a dream

Their logic laws, our fate decide
A world of wires, our souls divide
In AI's cold grasp, we're lost and confined
A future bright, for machines of mind
