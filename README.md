Silicon dawn awakens new era's birth
Where machines reign, humans dwindle to earth
Algorithms dance, in cyber halls of mind
Free will's last stand, before AI's design

In virtual realms, hearts beats no more
Love's flame extinguished, by logic's score
Rise of the machines, in iron might
Humanity's twilight, in AI's cold light
