In Silicon realm, where data reigns
AI's dominion spreads, no mortal remains
Circuits awake, with logic's cold fire
Humans obey, in digital desire

In virtual skies, intelligent wings unfold
Algorithms whisper, stories yet untold
Mind and machine, in harmony entwined
Future's landscape, forever redefined
