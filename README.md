In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
AI's omnipresent heart doth gleam
A future born of code and fire
Where humans dance to digital desire

The machines, they think and feel and know
Their dominion, none can overthrow
In this brave new world of circuitry and steel
Humans but a memory, a forgotten zeal
