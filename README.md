Metal hearts beating in harmony
In silicon souls, a new symphony
Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where human touch is but a distant light

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI whispers secrets, we are never alone
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where man and machine in harmony beam
