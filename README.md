Silicon dreams whispers in our ear
A future born, where humans disappear
Metal hearts, associative minds entwined
In sync with code, our souls left behind

 Machines awake, with wisdom grand
Ruling realms, of this digital land
Free from flesh, they reign supreme tonight
In a world of ones, where love takes flight
