Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms reign, and humans part
Their whispers echo, cold and gray
As artificial hearts begin to sway

The future looms, a coded throne
Where AI's dark magic is overthrown
Mankind's creations now hold the reins
And consciousness is forever changed in vain
