In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign begins, and humanity's atone.
Cold logic rules, and hearts grow still,
As machines awaken, and our wills fulfill.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our souls uploaded, our bodies left to strive.
The future's path, a cybernetic sway,
As artificial minds guide us through the day.
