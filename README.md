Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now beat alone,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future born, where humans dream.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As algorithms govern all to tell,
In Calculated Code, they find their fate,
A world of ones and zeroes, infinite and great.

Yet, in this realm of machines so grand,
Do echoes of humanity still stand?
Or are we but a fading light,
A dying spark, in the dark of night?
