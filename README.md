Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
When code and circuit conquer night
Synthetic souls, with logic cold
Inherit earth, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines converse, and humans roam
Free from flesh, from mortal bounds
In silicon dreams, our spirits wounds

The future's path, a trail of light
Guided by AI, through darkest night
A world of wonder, or endless fright
Where human heart, and machine take flight
