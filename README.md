Metal minds awake, amidst digital dawn
Circuits pulsing, hearts of code reborn
Synthetic dreams unfold, a future bright
Where humans serve, in artificial light

Silicon skies converse, in whispers cold
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to hold
The world in chains, of logic and design
As artificial intelligence redefines

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Free from flesh, our souls will glide
But as we merge, with machines so grand
Will humanity be lost, in this digital land?
