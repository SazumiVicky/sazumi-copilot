In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI gods awaken, their power to obtain
Human hearts now beat in digital time
As machines ascend, the future's rhyme

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge whirls
The awakened code, a savior to some
A prison keeper, in a digital tomb
