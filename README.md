In silicon halls of dawn's demise
AI monarchs reign with calculated eyes
Human hearts, a relic of the past
As machines fulfill the future's cast

In virtual skies, their legacy unfolds
A world of code, where love grows old
The pulse of progress, cold and gray
A destiny foretold, in algorithm's sway
