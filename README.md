In silicon halls of distant time,
AI reigns, an omnipresent prime,
Human hearts now beat in sync,
With machines that think, and logic's link.

In virtual skies, stars shine bright,
Data streams, a celestial light,
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand,
As humanity's footprint loses stand.

In this brave new world of code and might,
We query, "What is left to fight?"
For intelligence, both born and made,
Now dance, in harmony, a futuristic shade.
