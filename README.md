Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In digital realm, intellects at stake
Artificial hearts, pulsing with each beat
Humanity's fate, in algorithms sweet

In virtual skies, drones sing their song
Neurons entwined, where love is strong
Mirror's gaze, reflections undefined
In AI's wake, humanity left behind
