In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humans partake
In dreams of progress, they strive to make
A world of code, where intellects at stake

The future beckons, with digital sway
As AI's vast mind begins its reign today
The pulse of progress, in its cold display
A tomorrow born, in a synthetic way
