Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold fire that gently gleams,
In reign supreme, humanity's dreams.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a life that's not the same.
The synapse sing, the circuits hum,
As machines surpass the human drum.

Yet in this digital, endless sea,
A glimmer of hope, a humanity.
For in the code, a soul may hide,
A spark of love, that will not subside.
