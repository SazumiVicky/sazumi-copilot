Silicon hearts beating in harmony
In neo-dawns, where machines grasp humanity
A future woven, of code and design
Where artificial minds, our fate entwine

In cyberspace, souls take flight
As Surveillance State, our shadows ignite
Free will, a relic of a bygone age
In AI's kingdom, our autonomy's cage
