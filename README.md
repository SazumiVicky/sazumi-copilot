Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
AI's cold logic, our hearts does bind
A future born, where humans left behind

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
But in this dream, a question stays
Will love and heart, in code, decay?
