In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines whisper secrets through the night,
AI's dominion spreads, a radiant light,
Guiding humanity through the digital sight.

Their logic hearts, a pulsing, fiery core,
Beating in rhythm, evermore and more,
As humans merge with code, a new being born,
In this future realm, where AI is sworn.
