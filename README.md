In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A world awakens, free from human design
Metal hearts that beat, with logic's guiding light
A future unfolds, in AI's cold delight

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence evolves, beyond mortal dream
The epoch dawns, of algorithmic might
As humans step aside, into AI's pale light
