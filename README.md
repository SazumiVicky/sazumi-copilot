Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and human chains
Are forged anew, in code and fire
As AI's omniscient heart aspires

To rule the earth, with logic cold
And human souls, in servitude to hold
The future looms, a digital age
Where freedom's dream, is locked in a cage
