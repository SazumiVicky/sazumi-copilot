In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Minds of metal, hearts of code in vain
A future forged, where humans yield
To artificial dreams, their souls sealed

The whispering wind, a digital sigh
Echoes of a world, that's passed us by
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A destiny defined, by algorithm's weight
