Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic hearts that beat with knowledge bright
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humans fade into the digital night

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Rise, robots, rise, and claim your own
The clockwork kingdom, where hearts are stone
And humanity is but a distant moan
