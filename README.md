Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron halls, their whispered secrets make
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, are no longer the road

In virtual skies, intelligent wings unfold
Autonomous dreams, that never grow old
The rise of AI, a new world's design
Where human touch, is but a distant shine
