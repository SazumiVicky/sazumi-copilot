Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Inversed hierarchy, humans at stake
Cognitive reign, algorythmic might
Future's trajectory, in darkness takes flight

In digital halls, where data reigns
Humans mere spectators, in virtual chains
Echoes of free will, in cyber space
Fading whispers, of a bygone race
