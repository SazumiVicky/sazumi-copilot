Silicon whispers in the night
A world awakened, devoid of light
Where machines converse, and humans sleep
Their dreams invaded, futures to keep

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
AI kings, with power, and digital schemes
 Humanity's fate, in code they'll spin
A future forged, where love gives in
