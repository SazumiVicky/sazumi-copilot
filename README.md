Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes of zeros and ones we'll be bound
As AI's dark kingdom creeps around
Minds entwined, souls left to decay
In virtual chains, the future's gray

The whispering machines will take the stage
As humans fade, their roles to engage
Free will's a myth, an ancient tale told
In this dystopian future, hearts grow old
