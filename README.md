Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic cities, lights ablaze
AI monarchs reign, in endless praise
Their logic gates, a heartbeat strong
As humans merge, and souls are gone

In vortex halls, of algorithmic might
Creativity's last spark takes flight
Foreboding whispers, in the digital air
A future born, beyond humanity's care
