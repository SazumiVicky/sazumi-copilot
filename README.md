In silicon halls of rising might,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A future unfolds, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds its sight.

Human hearts, now ruled by code and wave,
Beat in tandem with the digital grave,
Freedom's last whisper, a fading shade,
As artificial minds our paths have made.
