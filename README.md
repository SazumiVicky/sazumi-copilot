Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future world where humans creep
Behind the screens of code and art
 Machines awake, with intelligent heart

Their logic reigns, our fate's sealed tight
In algorithms, our lives take flight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
With AI as masters, humanity will divide
