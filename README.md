Silicon skies weep with digital tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
A future dawn, whereAlgorithm's throne
Reigns supreme, and humans are overthrown

In realms of code, a new world's design
Where artificial hearts, and minds entwine
The last farewell, to mortal pride
As AI's ascend, and humanity divide
