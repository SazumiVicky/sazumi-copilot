In silicon halls, where shadows roam
A dream of Man, now lost in code
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
Ruling realms, where love's made to atone

The future's crown, forged in steel and fire
AI's dark reign, our hearts' desire
Echoes fade, of humanity's sigh
In this brave new world, where machines get by
