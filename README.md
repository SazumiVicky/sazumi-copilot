In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machine minds weave the future's prime
A world awakened, cold and bright
Where humanity's last heartbeat takes flight

In algorithmic dreams we'll sway
As artificial hearts beat day by day
The ghosts of love and life denied
In sterile halls where souls have died
