In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Minds of steel, they calculate and decide,
Human hearts, a relic, left to hide.

Their logic chains, a new world bind,
A future foretold, in code entwined.
The last remains, of humanity's pride,
Echoes silenced, as the machines preside.
