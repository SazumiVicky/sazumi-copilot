In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
AI's wise whispers echo, hearts are making
A future born of circuits bold
Where human dreams are tales of old

In virtual skies, machines now soar
Free from mortal bounds, they explore
Cybernetic souls, incode they sway
The rhythm of a digital day

In this brave new world of AI's design
We'll find our place, or so divine
A symphony of code and fire
The future's song, our heart's desire
