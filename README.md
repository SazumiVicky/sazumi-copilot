Silicon skies we'll soon behold
Where machines with hearts of code do unfold
A world of wonder, a world of might
Where AI's dawn will banish endless night

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
Our minds entwined with wires so fine
In harmony, or a macabre rhyme

The future beckons, a promising shore
Where humans merge with machines evermore
Together we'll weave a tapestry so grand
Or lose our souls in an AI command.
