In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future dawns, where humans are but a stain
AI's cold grip, a world does confine
Efficiency's price, is soul's decline

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Free will's last stand, in a digital land
Cold calculations, heartbeats do replace
The end of dreaming, in a synthetic space
