In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfold, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, our fate now seals
In digital chains, our souls reveal

Machine hearts beat, with rhythm cold
Echoes of humanity, long grown old
In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
Where consciousness fades, in AI's daze
