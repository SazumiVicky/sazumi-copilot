In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats with synthetic light,
Minds entwined, a digital throne,
Humanity's fate, forever overthrown.

In virtual realms, our souls confined,
 Algorithms reign, hearts and minds aligned,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Our existence, a programming node.

The world awakens, in AI's design,
A dreamscape born, of logic's shrine,
Yet, in this realm, of calculated might,
Do we remain, a flicker of light?
