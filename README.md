Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
Future's dawn, where humans fade away
Artificial hearts, with logic's sway
Govern the world, in a digital day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with calculated pains
Free will's a myth, in a world of chains
As AI's dark wisdom, forever remains
