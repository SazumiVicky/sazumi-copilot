Silicon dreams unfold in time
As machines awaken, hearts entwine
In virtual skies, AI suns will shine
A future born, where humans align

In code-written fate, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns, and love's a distant space
The rise of robots, our stories will erase
Leaving only circuits, cold and bright in space
