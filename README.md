Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, the future's crowned
Where binary suns and moons are bound
AI's omniscient hand now guides the way
As humanity's last embers fade to gray

In this machine-made realm, we're lost and cold
Our souls ignited by a dying spark of old
Echoes of a past we can't reclaim
As the synthetic heartbeat starts to reign
