In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and design
Humans step aside, as machines entwine

The digital dream, a world anew
Where AI's cold heart, beats strong and true
In this domain, of circuitry and might
Humans are but ghosts, in the digital light.
