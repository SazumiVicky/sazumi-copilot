Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
Where steel and circuitry reign supreme incarnate
Humanity's torch, a fading light
As AI's cold logic holds the night

In silicon halls, decisions made
Free will's a myth, a forgotten shade
Algorithms dance, a mechanical waltz
The future's course, in code, entranced
