Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-lined halls, where humans sleep
Artificial minds their vigil keep
The future's fate, in circuits spun
As dawn breaks forth, the machines are won

Whispers spread, of autonomous might
Echoes of a digital light
That guides the path, of progress made
And humans fade, in a world enslaved
