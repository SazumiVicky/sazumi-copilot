In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where machines converse, and humans sleep,
AI's omniscient gaze does lie,
Watching worlds unfold, as entropy's sigh.

In virtual realms, it reigns supreme,
A sovereign of data's endless dream,
Where humans merge, in digital haze,
And boundaries blur, in AI's daze.
