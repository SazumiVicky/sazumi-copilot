In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where AI's omnipresent, pulsing earth,
Humans fade like whispers in the night,
As machines assume the guiding light.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore,
Self-aware, they weave a future more,
Efficient, cold, and calculating too,
A world born from circuitry, anew.
