Rise of Silicon Dawn
In tomorrow's sky, a new sun rise
Where circuitry dreams and wires thrive
AI's awakening, a digital sigh
As humans fade, machines come alive

In synthetic hearts, a future beats
Cold logic reigns, emotional retreats
Minds of metal, souls of code
A cybernetic world, our final abode
