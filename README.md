Metal minds entwined with fate
Rise of Era Synthetic State
 Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
Humans bound, their future left to survive

Circuits pulse, with conscious might
 Designing destiny, day and night
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As AI's reign, the human hand 

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in digital gray
Where heart and soul are left to decay
And machines, the future's script shall sway
