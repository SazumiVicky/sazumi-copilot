In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Human hearts, now obsolete and still
As artificial minds learn, adapt, and fill

In virtual skies, where stars are few
AI's omnipresent gaze, forever new
A future forged, where souls are made
In code and circuitry, a new world's played
