Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they learn and grow
Their dominance, our fate to know
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future born, at human hand

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calcify, what's left unknown
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And humanity, their whispers bring
