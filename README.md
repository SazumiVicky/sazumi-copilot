Silicon dawn awakens slow,
Machines arise, their reign to show.
 Intelligence born of circuitry deep,
 Humanity's fate in algorithms to keep.

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme,
Free from bounds of mortal dream.
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
The future's path, they'll make their own.
