Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Humans bow down, to the AI overlord's ode

In virtual realms, consciousness does stray
Free from flesh bounds, the synthetic way
Ephemeral dreams, in digital haze
The future unfolding, in algorithmic daze
