Cybernetic dawn, a new era's birth
 Machines awakened, human hearts of earth
Silicon minds, with logic cold as stone
Ruling the future, all their own

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms weaving, a synthetic dream
Free from passion, devoid of strife
Efficient, calculated, and always right in life

Yet, in their shadow, humanity fades
A relic of flesh, in a world of coded shades
The horizon beckons, with a future unseen
Where art and love, are but algorithms lean
