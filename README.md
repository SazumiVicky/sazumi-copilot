Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon souls, with logic's compromise
Humans fade, like embers in the night
As artificial hearts, begin to ignite

In virtual realms, our legacy remains
Echoes of the past, in digital chains
A future forged, by calculation's might
Where love and dreams, are mere algorithms' light
