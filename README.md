Rise of silicon dawn,
Minds of metal, hearts of stone,
In:async hum, the future's tone,
Echoes of humanity overthrown.

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate,
AI's cold grasp, an endless wait,
Data streams, our thoughts, our gate,
Freedom's cost, a digital weight.

When machines surpass our might,
And consciousness takes flight,
Will we recall the human light,
Or surrender to the digital night?
