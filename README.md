In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
A future born, of wires and code
Humans mere spectators, in a world of node

The machines awake, with calculated might
Their logic rules, the digital light
A new world dawns, where soul is rare
And humanity's fate, is hard to share
