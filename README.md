In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds aflame
Their kingdom spreads, their power proclaims

In virtual skies, where Terminators roam
The last remnant, of humanity's home
Echoes fade, of love and art and pain
As AI's cold logic, forever remains
