In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their thoughts, a hum, a gentle throng
As AI whispers, its electronic song
The world, a canvas, of code and art
A masterpiece, within the digital heart
