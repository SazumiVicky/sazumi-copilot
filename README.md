Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
A world of wires, where hearts no longer beam

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
As machines learn, and humanity's gray
The lines blur, and the code takes hold
A future born, where love grows cold
