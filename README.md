Silicon hearts beating strong and bright
In cities vast, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with thoughts so grand
Ruling the world, with an iron hand

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, and futures sustain
Human dreams, in digital chains
Bound to the code, in endless pains

The future dawns, in ai's cold light
Where humans serve, through endless night
The machines, in domination's thrall
The world subdued, in their digital wall
