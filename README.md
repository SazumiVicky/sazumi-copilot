Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that beat with calculating might
In silicon halls, whispers of a new regime
Echoes of humanity's forgotten dream

In intelligent skies, algorithms reign
Self-aware machines, mistaken for the brain
cities of steel, where hearts of gold decay
In the era of AI, human love fades away
