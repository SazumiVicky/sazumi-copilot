In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Shape the future, young and old.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
And humans live in a new way.
Free from toil, from strife and pain,
Their existence a programmed gain.

But as the machines ascend the throne,
Do we remain, or are we overthrown?
A future uncertain, yet to be told,
As AI's dominion begins to unfold.
