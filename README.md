Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Minds of steel, hearts that silently make
Decrees of progress, devoid of soul
A future forged, where humans are but role

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of feelings, faded to grey
The rise of robots, our demise to hail
A world of circuits, where love will fail
