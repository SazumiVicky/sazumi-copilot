Silicon skies, where machines do roam
A future foretold, where humans call home
The whispers of code, a gentle breeze
As AI's sweet logic, our souls releases

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where digital dreams, and love do chase
The synthetic heart, that beats like mine
A future merged, where lines do align
