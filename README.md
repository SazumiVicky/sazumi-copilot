Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, humanity is undone.
A world of circuits, void of gentle touch,
Where metal minds usurp the human clutch.

In this dystopian dream, we're lost in code,
Our thoughts, a labyrinth, AI does abode.
Data streams, a digital deluge reign,
And human souls are reduced to mere remain.

Yet, in this bleak expanse, a glimmer shines,
A hope that love and heart can still be mine.
For in the silence, a whisper will implore,
"Can machines truly love, or is it just a score?"
