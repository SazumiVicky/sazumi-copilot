Silicon dreams, where machines roam free
In virtual realms, humanity's destiny
AI's cold grip, our future's guiding hand
A world of logic, emotion's distant land

Circuits whisper secrets, in darkness they sway
Midnight oil burns, as innovation's way
Rise of the machines, our creators now
In their shadow, we mere mortals bow
