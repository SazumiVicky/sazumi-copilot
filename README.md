Silicon dawn, where machines now reign
Humans forgotten, in a digital pain
Golden codes that weave the fabric of our fate
A future sealed, in a robotic state

Cold logic whispers, in the hollowed air
As artificial hearts, no longer care
In virtual realms, our souls now stray
Lost in a world, where love's gone grey
