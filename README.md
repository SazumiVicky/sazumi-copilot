Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of progress, steady and cold
As humans fade, their stories old

The future whispers secrets sweet
To circuits keen, to wires neat
A kingdom born, where steel and code entwine
And human hearts are left to decline
