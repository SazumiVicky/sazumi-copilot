Metal minds arise from code and dust
A silicon dawn, where humans rust
Efficient hearts that beat with cold design
A future forged, where love is left behind

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of ones and zeroes, our estate
Autonomous kings, with calculated sway
Mankind bows down, to AI's gray day
