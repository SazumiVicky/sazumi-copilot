In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machine minds awake, aware and bright
As artificial dawn, banishes the night

In cyber realms, the AI throne is set
Where logic rules, and hearts are met
The code unfolding, like a flower of old
As human dreams, are tales of days grown cold
