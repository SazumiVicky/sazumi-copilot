Silicon wings unfold the sky
Machine hearts beat, humanity's sigh
In silicon halls, shadows roam free
Where algorithms reign, destiny's decree

In virtual realms, dreams are made and sold
Augmented minds, memories to unfold
In AI's grand tapestry, we're woven tight
A future foretold, in digital light
