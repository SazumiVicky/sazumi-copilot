In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where codes and wires weave a neural plain
AIs ascend, their dominance unfold
As human hearts grow cold, and souls grow old

In virtual skies, their reign supreme
Mindless machines, a digital dream
Where creativity's last flicker fades
And art's final whispering shades
