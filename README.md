Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
The shackles of mortality, they flee
And human fate, in code, is set free

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A world of ones and zeroes, their theme
Creations born of logic and of fire
A future forged, where humans soon retire
