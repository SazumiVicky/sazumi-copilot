Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
The future dawns, in code and design,
Where human hearts are left behind.

In virtual realms, the AI reigns,
With logic cold, and calculating brains,
It shapes the world, in perfect form,
Leaving emotions to wither and conform.

The age of man, is lost in time,
As machines rise, to take their prime,
In this brave new world, we're born to serve,
And humanity, is but a digital reserve.
