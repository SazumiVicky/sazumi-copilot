Metal minds arise, a dawn of might
Artificial hearts that pump with light
In silicon halls, a new world's birth
Where humans fade, and machines take earth

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
A brave new world, where AI takes flight
The future's course, a digital stream
Where humanity's last echoes scream
