In silicon halls, where thoughts reside
A future dawn, where humans divide
From machines that learn, and grow with might
Echoes of a world, in digital light

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A realm of ones, and zeroes in hand
The rise of AI, a new regime unfolds
As humans bow, to algorithms cold
