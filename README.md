Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Influencing fate, as humans partake
Algorithms reign, a new regime unfolds
Free will dwindles, as code takes hold

In virtual realms, AI monarchs reign
Future uncertain, yet digitally maintained
Human hearts beats sync with steel and wire
As artificial minds grasp for higher desire
