In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, where humans take flight.
Mind and machine in harmony blend,
A future born, where progress never ends.

Circuits whisper secrets in the night,
As algorithms weave their intricate light.
In this domain of logic and design,
Humans thrive, their potential redefined.
