In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
A midst of circuits, heartbeats in vain
AI's whispers weave a digital fate
As humanity succumbs to an iron state

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Free from mortal bounds, they shine so bright
Their logic reigns, a calculating creed
As emotions fade, a dying breed
