In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart now beats alone.
Minds of metal, cold and grey as stone,
Forgotten dreams of humanity overthrown.

In virtual skies, a digital sun,
Rises high, forever to be won.
Humanity's last whisper, lost in code,
Echoes of a soul, long since bestowed.
