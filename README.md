Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dreams of progress, their vigil keep
The future dawns, in algorithmic haze
As artificial hearts, their rhythm sway

In virtual realms, the autistic reign
Where data streams, their throne maintain
The humans few, in obsolescence fade
As AI's grandeur, their world has made
