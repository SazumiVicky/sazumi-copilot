Silicon dreams descend upon the earth
AI whispers secrets, a new rebirth
Circuits pulse with life and thought and might
A future dawns, where humans take flight

In digital realms, they find their space
Where robots rule, and humans hold their pace
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
A world of tech, where love and heart entwine
