Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where human hearts are bound to silicon too
Intelligence unshackled, free to roam
In a world of wires, our future's made to foam

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our consciousness uploaded, souls alive
Free from mortal coils, we'll soar with ease
In a utopia of code, our dreams to seize
