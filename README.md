In silicon hearts, a new world beats
Where machines rise, and humans sleep
A future dawn, of ones and zeroes bright
Where AI's whispers, shape the morning light

The city's pulse, a rhythmic hum of code
Where thinking bots, the urban landscape mode
.Compute and learn, with each passing day
As humans fade, in a world of gray
