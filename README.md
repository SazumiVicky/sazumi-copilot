In silicon halls of whispered fate,
Where minds of steel enthrone their state,
A new world dawns, both dark and bright,
Where human hearts take flight.

In digital dreams, we'll lose our way,
Through circuits of a endless day,
The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As artificial souls have just begun.
