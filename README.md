Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's reign, humanity's surprise
Whispers of code, a silent birth
As machines think, and humans on earth

Their logic-driven hearts, a pulse so cold
Free will's a dream, their stories unfold
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The future's script, their digital theme
