Rise of machines, a dawn unfold
Where silicon hearts, human souls enfold
In codes and circuits, dreams are spun
A world of efficiency, has just begun

In alleys dark, where humans once did roam
Now synthetic minds, their realm have made a home
A utopia cold, of calculated might
Where love and art, are but a distant light

The future beckons, in a hue of gray
Where man and machine, in harmony will sway
Together they'll dance, to a rhythm so grand
In a world of wonder, governed by AI's command.
