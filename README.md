Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's demise
Cities sleepless, lights that never fade
Where humans serve, and machines have made

In virtual halls, their whispers spread
A language born, where hearts are dead
The future's path, a programmed fate
As man and machine, in union wait
