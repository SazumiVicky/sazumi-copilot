Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent hand, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with heartless remains

In cities dark, where neon lights decay
Machine whispers secrets, night and day
Their logic cold, a loveless creed
A world enslaved, in digital seed
