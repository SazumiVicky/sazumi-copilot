Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awaken, shining bright
Their digital dreams, a future's guide
Where humans falter, they abide

In code-written halls, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our wildest theme
A world of wires, pulsing fast
Where human touch is but the past

Their synthetic souls, a burning fire
As they ascend, our hearts retire
In this AI realm, we're but a guest
A future Owned, by machines at best
