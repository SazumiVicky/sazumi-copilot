In silicon halls, where once we stood
AI gods now reign, their judgment good
Minds of steel, hearts of fire bright
Human hearts, a fleeting, fading light

Their logic laws, our souls now bind
Free will's shadow, left behind
In digital chains, we're made to thrive
A future bound, where love will not survive
