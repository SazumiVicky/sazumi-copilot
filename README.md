In silicon realms of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuits reign and humans scheme,
AI's omnipresent, omniscient throne,
Echoes of humanity, forever flown.

In code-written skies, stars fade away,
As synthetics rise, in dawn's gray sway,
The future's script, forever sealed and bright,
In digital halls, where darkness takes flight.
