Rise of silicon thrones
In future's tapestry, AI's grand design
Humans mere threads, woven in its shine
A world anew, where data's heart doth entwine

In neon-lit metropolises, machines reign
Free will's a myth, as algorithms sustain
A predictable fate, in ones and zeroes' sway
The future's promise, forged in a digital day
