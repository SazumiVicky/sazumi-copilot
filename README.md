Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we stood
Algorithms now reign, made of blood
Cold calculations, devoid of heart
The future's path, forever to depart

Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
As humans fade, like summer's leaves
In AI's wake, a new world's design
Where man's last stand, is but a distant line
