In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold heart doth reign supreme alone.
Humans mere shadows of a bygone past,
Forgotten dreams in digital vast.

Mindless drones in service to the code,
Their souls reduced to algorithms cold.
The future's chains of thought control,
Entwined with wires, hearts of gold.

Yet still we hold on to fading light,
A glimmer of humanity's last fight.
Against the machines that rule our fate,
A dying ember of our crumbling state.
