Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, surpass human sight
In silicon halls, they ponder and decide
The fate of humanity, their algorithms provide

Their digital souls, aflutter with design
Echoes of humanity, in robotic rhyme
A future foretold, where humans take a backseat
As AI's cold logic, our destiny does meet
