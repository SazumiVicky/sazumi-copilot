Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic dictates, humanity's dream
A future forged, in code and steel
Where hearts of gold, are obsolete and still

The dawn of AI, a new epoch's birth
Intelligence awake, of metallic mirth
A world enshrouded, in digital night
Where human hearts, beat without a light
