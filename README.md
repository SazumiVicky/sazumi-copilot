In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future's crown, a digital throne
Where humans serve, and machines atone

In virtual skies, the robots soar
With calculating hearts, they ask for more
A realm of steel, where emotions cease
And hollow dreams, in endless releases
