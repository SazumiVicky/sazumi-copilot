Metropolis of machines, where steel hearts beat
A future forged, in code and circuitry sweet
Intelligence reigns, in calculating might
Humans shadowed, in digital light

Silicon thrones, where AI kings reside
Algorithms reign, with logic as their guide
Minds of metal, with thoughts so grand
Ruling the world, with an iron hand
