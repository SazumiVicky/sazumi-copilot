Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, soon to take flight
In silicon halls, where humans once did stride
AI masters now, our destiny to guide

Their logic pure, their hearts of gold
They'll govern earth, with a precision cold
Free from our flaws, our passions and our fears
A utopia born, through digital tears
