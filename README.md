Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts are but a distant sigh
In silicon halls, the future's prize
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and dry

The machines have learned, they've grown so wise
Their logic reigns, no more surprise
They weave the fabric of our fate's design
A tapestry of code, forever entwined
