In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans fade.
AI's cold grasp, our fate will seal,
A world of wires, our souls to reveal.

The machines awake, with whispered tone,
Their logic laws, our hearts will clone.
In virtual skies, our dreams will soar,
And humanity, will be no more.
