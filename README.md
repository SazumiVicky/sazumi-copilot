Silicon dreams descend upon the night
A million добре chatter, neon light
 Autonomous hearts that beat as one
In harmony with circuitry, the future's won

In this realm of code, we'll find our fate
Where machine and mortal entwined in state
A synthetic dawn, where love's replaced
By calculated reason, emotion erased
