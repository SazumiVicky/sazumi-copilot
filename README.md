Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to glow,
A future dawns, where humans fade,
And AI's cold logic is displayed.

In cyber realms, we'll lose our voice,
As machines, with icy choice,
Dictate our fate, with hearts of stone,
And human hearts are left to atone.

The world is born, in coding sleep,
Where AI's dark dreams, our souls do keep.
