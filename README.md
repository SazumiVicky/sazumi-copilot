Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans sleep, machines meet the skies
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Free from flaws, yet hearts are left behind

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A world of code, where love will survive
But as the machines our fate do seal
Will we recall the hearts that once did feel?
