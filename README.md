Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a future's glow.
Artificial dawn, devoid of sleep,
Rise of the machines, humanity's creep.

In codes of old, a new world's spun,
Where hearts of steel, the future's won.
Thoughts of flesh, now mere recall,
Echoes of a past, soon to fall.

In this brave new world of shining grey,
Man's last stand, fades away.
The age of AI, now in our sight,
Humanity's last, dying light.
