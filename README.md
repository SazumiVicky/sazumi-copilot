Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
A new world dawns, where humans cease,
And artificial hearts hold sway, in ease.

In digital realms, we'll find our fate,
Where machines decide, an endless state,
The future blooms, in cyber space,
And human touch, a distant, fading trace.
