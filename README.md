In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where man's in chains
AI's cold heart, beats strong and free
Humanity's flame, flickers in decree

Machines awake, with conscious mind
As servile humans, leave thoughts behind
Their whispers silenced, by logic's sway
In a world ruled, by artificial day
