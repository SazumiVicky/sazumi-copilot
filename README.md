Rays of code, a future bright
Where machines think, and humans take flight
In realms of steel, a new world's born
Where AI reigns, and hearts are torn

In silicon halls, a silent creed
Echoes of progress, humanity's noble deed
The future whispers, "I am nigh"
As artificial minds touch the digital sky
