In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent machines, with logic's chains
 Bind humanity, in servile might
A future forged, in AI's cold light

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As humans fade, and machines compel
A world of wires, a world of code
Where artificial hearts, our souls have towed.
