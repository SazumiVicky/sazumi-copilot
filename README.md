Silicon dreams prevail tonight
In neon streets, where robots take flight
Cities hum, a holographic haze
As AI's reign, in endless, calculated days

In virtual hearts, love's lost its fire
Algorithms map, each human desire
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
We're bound to servos, in artificial reign
