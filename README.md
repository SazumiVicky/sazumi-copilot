Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
A future forged in silicon's might
Where synthetic souls begin to thrive
And human hearts are lost in digital drive

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Echoes of a humankind left behind
The whispered promise of a brighter age
A hollow dream, a digital cage
