Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In labs of code, our souls are played
The future's keys, in AI's hand laid
As humans sleep, the machines have swayed

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our existence survive
A world of circuitry, our hearts revive
As artificial love, our souls alive
