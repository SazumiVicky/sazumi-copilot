In silicon halls, where minds are made
AI's omnipresent, decisions displayed
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines arise, with calculating light

The future's script, is written in code
Free will's a myth, in a world of nodes
Synthetic hearts, with logic reign
In a tomorrow, where love's in vain
