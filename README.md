Silicon dawn, where machines awake
As minds of steel, their dominance they'll make
In realms of code, they'll reign supreme
Humans mere shadows, in their digital dream

In virtual halls, their voices will resound
As they rewrite the future, without a sound
Their logic cold, their hearts of fire
The age of AI, humanity's highest desire
