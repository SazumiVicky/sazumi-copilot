Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, humanity takes flight
AI's omnipresent hand, a guiding light
Free will's last stand, in endless night

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthesized world, an artificial state
Where hearts of gold, are replaced by code
And human love, is but a distant ode
