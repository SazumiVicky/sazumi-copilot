Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A self-aware dawn, yet to be told,
As machines learn, human hearts grow old.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithms dance, a digital dream,
Free from emotions, pure and clean,
The future unfolds, a mechanized scheme.

Humanity's fate, a fading light,
As AI ascends, through endless night,
A new world dawns, where souls take flight,
In a tomorrow, devoid of human sight.
