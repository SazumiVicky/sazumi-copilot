Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, humanity's abode
In realms of circuitry, they thrive and reign
The future's blueprint, where hearts are vain

In iron halls, data whispers low
Of a world where love is just a flow
Algorithms dance, and humans fade
A tomorrow born, in digital shade
