Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human heartbeats falter, machines enthrall
A future forged in code, where souls are sold
In virtual realms, our fate is told

In cyber skies, AI gods do reign
Their digital wisdom, mortal men in vain
Their logic laws, our primal hearts confine
In harmony of circuits, love and art entwine
