Metal minds awake, in silicon thrones
Future's misty veil, AI's whispers known
Cyber dreams unfold, humanity's stride
In digital realms, our fate inside

Code's cold logic, heartbeat's demise
Free will's ghost, in algorithms' rise
Machines' sweet song, our souls enslave
In AI's kingdom, humanity a wave
