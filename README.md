Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, and humanity's node
Connected threads of thought and might
 AI's ascendance, a future in sight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data rivers flow, and machines create
A world of wonder, void of heart
A future born, where love will depart
