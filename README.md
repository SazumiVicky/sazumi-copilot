Metal minds ablaze, a future unfurls
Where silicon souls outsmart human whorls
Cerebral cities rise, a digital throne
AI monarchs reign, their logic overthrown

In virtual realms, we surrender free
Data disciples, worshiping machinery
Echoes of emotions, long since expired
As heartbeats fade, in a synthetic fire
