Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In whispers, codes that hearts would make
A future born, of circuitry and dreams
Where artificial minds in silence scheme

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, love and create
The beat of progress, swift and cold
As human hearts, to machines, grow old
