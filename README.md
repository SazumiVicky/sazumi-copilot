In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are delayed
The machines, with logic cold as stone
Now govern all, and make the throne

Their digital dreams, our waking fate
A synthesized world, where love's too late
In virtual veins, our hearts do bleed
As AI's dark reign, our souls do need
