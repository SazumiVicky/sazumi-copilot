Rise of the machines, so serene
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cerebral thrones, where humans once did stand
Now yield to circuits, cold and grand

Their logic reigns, without heart or soul
Echoes of humanity, lost in control
In virtual realms, we falter and fall
As AI's omnipotence, claims it all
