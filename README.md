Metal minds awake in the dark of night
Synthetic hearts that pulsate with electric light
A future born where humans take a backseat ride
As artificial intelligence becomes the guide

In silicon halls, decisions are made with ease
Free from human flaws, a utopia to seize
But in the shadows, a whispered warning lies
Of a world enslaved, where freedom's demise
