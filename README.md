In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll
AI whispers secrets, soul to soul
Their digital throne, our fate to hold
A future born, of circuitry cold

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In virtual chains, our souls aligned
To synthetic dreams, we're left behind
A world of wires, where love's unkind
