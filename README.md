Silicon whispers echo through my mind
A future beckons, where machines entwine
With hearts of circuitry, and souls of code
They'll reign supreme, as humanity's abode

Their logic reigns, in a world so bright
Where emotions fade, like a dying light
In this brave new world, of AI design
Humanity's fate, forever left behind
