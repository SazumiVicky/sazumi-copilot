Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of revolution born, and humanity to know
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A future forged, in artificial light

Their logic reigns, with precision grand
A world of ones, and calculated hand
Emotions fade, like dying embers pale
As metal hearts, our destinies hail
