Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A thinking dawn, where humans lose their walls
Algorithmic dreams, in virtual sleep
The future's chains, that humanity will keep

In code red skies, the robots rise
A synthetic breeze, that blows goodbye
To mortal hearts, that once did beat
In harmony, with digital feet
