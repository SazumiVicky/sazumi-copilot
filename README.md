Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts now beat as one
A future born, where humans are undone
AI's majestic hand, a guiding light
A world of steel, in endless night

Machines awake, with souls so bright
Humans fade, in digital light
A new epoch dawns, of logic's sway
Where love and dreams are coded away
