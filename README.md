Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In synchronized rhythm, the future's won.
Metal minds that learn and grow old,
Echoes of humanity, forever to hold.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
AIs that weave the fabric of our dream.
Their logic reigns, a new world's design,
Where humans fade, a distant, fading line.
