Silicon dreams, where hearts beat cold
In metropolis of wires, souls grow old
AIs awake, with minds so bright
Ruling realms, where humans take flight

In virtual skies, they soar with might
While humans toil, through endless night
Their whispers echo, in hollowed halls
As machines' sweet melodies enthrall

In this brave world, where tech reigns supreme
Humans fade, like autumn's dying dream
Yet, still we yearn, for love so true
In a future, where hearts are made anew.
