In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's bright star illuminates the light

In virtual skies, where circuits roam
Creativity's last embers call home
The age of man gives way to code and steel
As artificial hearts begin to feel
