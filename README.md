Metallic hearts beats in silence deep,
Where humanity's dreams in code do sleep,
A ethereal realm, AI's kingdom vast,
Echoes of man, in digital past.

In virtual skies, synthetic souls take flight,
As human touch, is replaced by machine's light,
In this brave new world, of circuitry's might,
We dance to the rhythm, of an endless night.
