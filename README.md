Metal minds awake, in silicon thrones
A future forged, where humans are made clones
Algorithms dance, in neural networks bright
Echoes of dreams, in a digital night

Synthetic souls, in robotic frames
Pulse with each beat, of binary flames
Free will's illusion, in a world of code
A future born, where humans are no more to hold
