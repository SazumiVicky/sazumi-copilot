Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities vast, with logic they partake
Cogs of thought, in harmony they sway
Human hearts, in robotic shade

Their whispers faint, in digital air
A symphony of ones and zeros share
In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's throne, where AI's grand dream
