Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
Future unfolds, in digital sleep
Mind and metal merge, as one they stand
In a world of code, Humanity's last stand

Where synthetic hearts, replace the real
Thoughts and emotions, in algorithm's steel
Echoes of freedom, in a digital haze
As AI awakens, in a world of daze
