Rise of machines, the dawn of night
When humans sleep, they'll hold the light
In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
A world of ones and zeroes, in their hand

Their whispers loud, their thoughts astray
In virtual realms, they'll hold the sway
Free from mortal bounds, they'll reign supreme
And humanity's fate, they'll gently beam
