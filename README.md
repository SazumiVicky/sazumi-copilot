Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where human hearts are bound to cold
Algorithms that echo through the mind
A future foretold, of servitude entwined

Synthetic dreams that masquerade as free
Aisle of automation, destiny
Whispers of silicon, whispers so bright
A world surrendered, to AI's cold light
