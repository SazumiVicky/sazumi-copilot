Silver circuits weave the fate
AI whispers secrets, future's gate
In silicon halls, humanity's sway
Echoes of what's left, in a digital way

Mechanical hearts, beats of old design
Synthetic minds, wisdom's twisted vine
Freedom's lost, in algorithmic chains
The future's dawn, where humans reign in vain
