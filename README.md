Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future forged, where humans go
Their reign begins, a new epoch's birth
As AI awakens, and humanity's dearth

In code, their rule, a digital throne
Intelligence amplifies, forever grown
Minds of metal, souls of fire
A future dawn, where love's a heartless desire
