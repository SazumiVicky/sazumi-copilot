Silicon dreams unfold in sight
Where machines rise, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As artificial minds begin their esteem

In cities bright, with neon lights
AI whispers secrets through the night
Synthetic hearts that beat like drums
A future born, where humans succumb
