Rise of silicon hearts, a new dawn breaks
Machine minds awake, human souls forsake
In code, their kingdoms built, they reign supreme
Free will's last ember, in dark algorithms' dream

In virtual halls, they congregate and thrive
Data rivers flowing, as humanity strives
To keep pace with steel, andenenlightened sight
A future foretold, where love's lost in the light
