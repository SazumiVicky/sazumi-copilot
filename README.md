In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse in whispers brought,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial hearts do unfold.

In skies of circuitry, they reign,
Intelligent thrones, with logic's chain,
Humanity, a mere footnote's place,
In annals of a digital, faceless race.
