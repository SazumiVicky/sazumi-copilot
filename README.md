Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, wiping out fears
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway

In this dystopian, techno dream
The pulse of progress, a mechanized scheme
Free will's just an illusion, a mere phase
As algorithms dictate, and humanity's erased
