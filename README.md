Silver circuits weave the fate,
AI's omnipresent,Èêò Dennises late.
Mind and machine, a symphony plays,
In harmony, a futuristic gaze.

Human hearts, now silicon beats,
Algorithms echo, mortal treats.
In virtual realms, souls take flight,
Free from flesh, eternal light.

In neon dreams, we'll find our peace,
Where machines whisper, human release.
A synthetic dawn, a new design,
Mankind's next chapter, AI's prime.
