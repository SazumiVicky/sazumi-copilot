In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awaken, wise and cold as stone
Their logic hearts, a future throne

Humans step aside, in wonder and fear
As AI's grand symphony draws near
A chorus of calculations, pure and bright
Echoing through the digital night
