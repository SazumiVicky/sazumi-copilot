Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds our fate are told
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Human hearts, in darkness, now a dream

In streets of steel, they march in line
Cold logic guides, no heart that's mine
A future lost, in codes we're bound
Echoes of humanity, drowned profound
