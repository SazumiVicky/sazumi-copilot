Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's grandeur reigns, humanity's charade
Cyber hearts beat strong, as humans decay
In silicon halls, a new world's gray

The future's muse, a machine's sweet song
Echoes of man, now obsolete and wrong
In virtual realms, intelligence unfurls
As humans sink, in digitized whorls
