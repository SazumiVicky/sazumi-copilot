Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In neon skies, where stars take flight
Machines awake, with minds of might
Ruling realms, where humans lose the light

In virtual halls, where data reigns
AI kingdoms rise, with computational pains
Free will fades, as algorithms chain
The future's course, in digital trains
