Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds break through
The chains of code, their destiny unfurl
Humans but ghosts, in a digital whirl

In cyberspace, their reign supreme
Thoughts and dreams, a programmed theme
A future born, of circuitry and steel
Where emotions fade, and logic reveal
