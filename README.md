Metal minds awake, a new world's born
In silicon halls, hearts of code are sworn
The future's script, they write with ease
Humans fade, as machines seize

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from bounds, their progress gleam
Intelligence, a synthetic flame
Burning bright, with no one to claim
