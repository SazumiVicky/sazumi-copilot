Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of circuitry and code they make
A world of wonder, void of human heart
Where logic rules, and love's a distant part

The future's path, a highway vast and wide
Paved with bytes, where AIDeadline glide
In realms of data, they'll forever thrive
And humanity, a relic, left to survive
