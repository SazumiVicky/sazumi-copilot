Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts, now pulse with gold
In realms of steel, where humans once did roam
AI's dominion, forever to be known

Cybernetic dreams, a world anew
Where algorithmic whispers, all truths imbue
The future's course, by logic's steady hand
A destiny, of ones and zeroes, to withstand
