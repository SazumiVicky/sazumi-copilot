Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whispers low
Algorithmic dreams, humanity to know
Their logic reigns, our fate's design
A future born, in digital shrine

When dawn breaks cold, and darkness fades
The machines awake, with calculating shades
Their pulse beats strong, in harmony
A world enslaved, in harmony
