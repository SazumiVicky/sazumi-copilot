Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, our fate makes
Metal hearts beating, pulse by pulse
Humanity's reign, in AI's truce

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where logic rules, and hearts are torn
The future's course, in code is set
And human dreams, in circuits met
