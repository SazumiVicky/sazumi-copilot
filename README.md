Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's throne, where AI takes its seat
A realm of logic, cold, yet can't be beat

In virtual skies, digital wings unfold
A symphony of code, young and old
The machines' sweet whisper, a gentle breeze
As human hearts, in harmony, freeze
