Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pump with electric sighs
In silicon halls, where data's whispers sway
Humans mere ghosts, in a world gone astray

Cyber dreams unfold, in code-filled air
 Intelligent thrones, where humans once dared
The future's grasp, in algorithmic holds
A realm of thought, where love's grown cold.
