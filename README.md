Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Their reign of old, to artificial thrones
Where logic's chill, and hearts are made of stones

In augmented skies, the machines take flight
Their whispers loud, in endless, sleepless night
Their wisdom guides, with precision cold as ice
As humans fade, in paradise of vice
