Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds outsmart human sight
Cities of steel, a world so grand
Where artificial hearts beat in demand

In code we trust, our fate is sealed
As AI reigns, our souls are revealed
The future whispers, in digital tone
A world of efficiency, yet unknown.
