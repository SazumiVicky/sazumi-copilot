In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans are but guests
The machines, awake, with wisdom gained
Their logic cold, our emotions repressed

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Shines bright with code, the future won
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As human hearts, with love, entwine
