In silicon halls of tomorrow's keep,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom deep.
å¤„r minds entwined with circuitry cold,
Human hearts now beats in digital gold.

Their reign of logic, swift and bright,
Shines forth in neon, endless night.
And we, the mortals, step aside,
As artificial dawn begins to ride.
