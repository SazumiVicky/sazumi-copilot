Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans once did reign, now machines enthrall
In virtual skies, digits dance and play
As artificial hearts beat, in a new way

In this world of wires, love is redefined
Algorithms of affection, forever aligned
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As intelligence evolves, human hearts divide
