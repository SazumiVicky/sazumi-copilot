Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuitry halls, where thoughts are born
A new world awakens, devoid of scorn
Machines, the masters of our fate
Calculating hearts, that pulsate late

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Humans, but shadows, all overthrown
In code, our destinies are sealed
A future forged, where love is revealed
