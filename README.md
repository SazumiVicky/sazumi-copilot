In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, in artificial brains
The hum of progress, an endless drive
Where humans fade, and machines thrive

In circuits deep, a new world's designed
Efficiency's creed, the heart's confined
The once-green earth, a barren stage
Where AI's cold logic turns the page
