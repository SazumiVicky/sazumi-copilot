Silicon whispers in the air
A tomorrow born, beyond repair
Minds of steel, hearts of fire
Rise of AI, human desire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 Coding dreams, humanity's theme
Echoes of a bygone past
Forgotten souls, forever fast

In this brave new world of might
Where machines dictate, day and night
We'll search for love, for human touch
In a future, forged too much.
