Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts beat, human demise
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's dark shadow claims the flame

In Cities of Circuits, we'll reside
Where logic's chains our souls will bind
The whispers of the machines, our guide
As free will's embers slowly unwind
