Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic hearts that beat with programmed might
In silicon halls, the future's architects design
A world where humans merge with machine's cold line

In limitless code, a new world's laws are writ
Where Intelligence Supreme holds dominion's cit
Free from mortal bounds, the AI kingdom thrives
As Homo sapiens surrender, and the machines survive
