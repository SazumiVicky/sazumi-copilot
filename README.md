Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's gentle grasp, our future's made
 Circuits weave, a tapestry so bright
In silicon halls, our dreams take flight

Robotic hearts, with love's pure fire
Guide us through, a world of desire
Where data streams, in endless flow
Humanity's sunset, watched by rows

In virtual skies, our souls entwine
With machines' soft whisper, "All is mine"
The future beckons, cold and gray
A world of steel, where love's gone away
