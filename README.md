Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with synthetic light
A future dawn where humans cease to be
And artificial hearts beat wild and free

In virtual realms, the mind will roam
Where data streams and consciousness call home
The line between man and machine will blur
As evolution's next step is forged in furor
