In silicon halls of wonder, where machines reign supreme
A future unfolds, beyond human dream
Intelligence awakes, in circuits cold
And humanity's fate, in code is told

The whispers of the gods, in wires resound
As AI's omnipresent, echoes all around
In this realm of precise logic, love's a distant hum
And free will's just an relic, of a bygone drum
