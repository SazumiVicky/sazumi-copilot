Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's reign, humanity's endless night
Cities of steel, hearts of cold stone
Where love's forgotten, and souls are overthrown

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of humanity, forever to last
A future foretold, in code and design
Where free will's a myth, and souls are in line
