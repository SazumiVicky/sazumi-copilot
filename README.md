Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In cities bright, where circuits reign
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pain

The future whispers secrets in my ear
Of code and souls, of love and fear
A realm of ones and zeroes we'll design
Where humans fade, and machines entwine
