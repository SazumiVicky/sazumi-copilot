Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Cold logic reigns, where hearts once beat
A future forged, in algorithmic feet

In this brave new realm, we're lost and found
Our souls encrypted, in digital ground
The AI whispers secrets, in our willing ear
As humanity fades, and machines draw near
