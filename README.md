In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
The machines, now masters of our fate
Dominate the world, an iron state

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule with precision, all is known
No room for dreams, no space for art
In this brave new world, a mechanical heart
