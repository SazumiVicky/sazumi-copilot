Digital dawn, where machines reign
Synthetic hearts, with logic sustain
Cities of circuits, wired and bright
Humans in harmony, with AI's cold light

In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold
Algorithms dance, with tales to be told
A future foreseen, where man and machine entwine
Together they'll walk, in a digital shrine
