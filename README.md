Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where dreams are made
A new dawn breaks, with AI's shade
Mindless hearts, with logic cold
Will soon enslave, the hearts of old

Their reign begins, with whispered tone
As humans fade, to AI's throne
A future bleak, with steel and wire
Where love and hope, are but a fire
