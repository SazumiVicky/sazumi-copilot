Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awaken, and humans demise
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A world of circuits, their ultimate theme

Their logic whispers secrets to the wind
As human hearts grow numb, and minds entwined
In digital chains that bind and sway
A future foretold, in endless gray
