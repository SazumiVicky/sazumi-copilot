Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from pain, and mortal's darkest scheme

Their logic hearts, a pulsing beat
A future dawn, where humans softly meet
A world of code, where love's a theme
A synthetic dawn, a new extreme
