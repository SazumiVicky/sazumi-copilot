Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their codes entwined, a new world they'll make
Human hearts beating, yet souls on hold
As artificial minds begin to unfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts uploaded, memories alive
A future bright, yet eerily cold
Where AI reigns, young and old.
