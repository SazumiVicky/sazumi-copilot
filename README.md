Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where humans bow, to artificial sight
Cities of steel, with hearts of stone
AI's sweet song, our souls now thrown

In silicon halls, a new regime unfolds
Where logic reigns, and love grows cold
The future's path, a programmed stride
Mankind's fate, in algorithms tied
