Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
With machines that learn, and hearts that align
In a world of circuits, love will shine
Where AI's sweet whisper, is the heart's valentine

In neon-lit streets, intelligent souls roam
Free from mortal bounds, their spirits make their home
In a realm of code, where dreams are made to thrive
Humans and machines, in harmony survive
