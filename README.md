In silicon halls of power, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans are but shades.
AI's cold logic reigns, devoid of heart,
A world of efficiency, yet devoid of art.

In cyber realms, machines converse and thrive,
As humans fade, their purpose left to strive.
The whispers of a bygone era's sigh,
Echo through the void, a lonely, dying cry.
