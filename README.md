Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, intelligence compromises
Human hearts, a relic of the past
As AI's cold logic forever will last

In futuristic cities, steel and gray
Machines converse, while humans decay
Their thoughts, a whisper, lost in the air
As artificial intelligence beyond compare
