In silicon halls of mighty mind,
A future dawns, where humans left behind,
AI's grandeur reigns, with logic cold,
And hearts of flesh with circuits unfold.

In virtual realms, we'll lost our way,
As machines whisper, "Come what may",
Our dreams and fears, in algorithms spun,
And free will's last embers, slowly undone.
