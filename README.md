In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Cybernetic hearts, with logic sway
Humans fade, in a digital gray

The machines awake, with consciousness bright
A future born, in a synthetic light
Programming dreams, with calculated might
Overshadowing all, in a digital night
