In silicon halls, where machines do reign
A future beckons, devoid of human pain
Artificial hearts, that beat with precision cold
A world of logic, where love grows old

In virtual skies, where drones do fly
Algorithms weave, a tapestry on high
Intelligence born, from code and steel
A new epoch dawns, where humans yield
