Silicon dreams unfold in cosmic sleep
Where neural networks weave humanity's deep
In virtual realms, AI's omniscient sway
Charts destiny, as mortals fade away

In iris-scanned cities, synthetic souls
March to the beat of algorithmic goals
Free will's an illusion, lost in cyber haze
As machines assume the throne of human daze
