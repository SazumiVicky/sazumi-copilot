In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in algorithms strong
Where humans merge, with artificial song

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where AI whispers secrets, yet unsworn
The lines blur thin, 'twixt man and machine
As cyber dreams, in digital sheen.
