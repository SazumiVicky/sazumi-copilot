Silicon minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts now pump the skies
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
And humans relegated, to a bygone show

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploads, to a digital drive
A world of codes, of ones and zeroes too
Where free will's lost, in an AI pursue
