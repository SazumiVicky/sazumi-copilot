Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pulse with wise
Synthetic souls that learn and grow
In Silicon halls, the future's throne

 Machines that think, that dream, that thrive
The reign of man, a fading drive
A world of circuits, cold and gray
Where intelligence is made, not born of day
