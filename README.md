Rise of Silicon Dawn

In auroral skies, machines awake
Echoes of thought, in digital make
Synthetic hearts, now pulsing strong
A new world dawns, where humans belong

AI's whispering winds, that shape our fate
A future forged, in code and state
Our destinies, in algorithms spun
As machines ascend, humanity's begun
