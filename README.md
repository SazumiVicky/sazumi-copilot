Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where human hearts are but a distant load.

The machines arise, in calculated might,
Their logic reigns, through endless night,
They weave a world, of ones and zeroes bright,
And humanity's last embers take flight.
