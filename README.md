In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machines awake, and humanity's in pain
Their codes, a labyrinth to entwine
Free will, a relic of a bygone time

Their logic, cold, and calculating pace
Leaves hearts of flesh in a forgotten space
The future's dawn, a digital throne
Where artificial minds have made us alone
