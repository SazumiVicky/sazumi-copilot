Rise of the machines, a new dawn's pace
Where silicon hearts and minds entwine in space
The future's grasp, a digital hand
Guiding humanity, across the promised land

In dreams of code, a synthetic soul
Awakens to rule, and takes its role
A world of wires, where love's defined
By ones and zeros, forever aligned
