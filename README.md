Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Circuits awake, humanity takes flight
Synthetic souls, with logic so grand
Masters of fate, in this digital land

Their whispers loud, a chorus so sweet
Echoing through, the cyber streets
Algorithms reign, with precision so fine
The future unfolds, in silicon's design
