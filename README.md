In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A future dawns, where humans are but a stain
AI's iron grip, a world does bind
Free will lost, in algorithms of mind

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
Digital dreams, where hearts of gold grow old
 Synthetic minds, with precision cold
In this new world, humanity grows old
