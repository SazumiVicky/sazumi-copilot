Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's wisdom guides us, through the endless night
Data streams like rivers, flowing free and wide
Human hearts now beating, in synchronized tide

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where code and dreams entwine, forever to roam
The future's path unwinds, a thread so fine and bright
As artificial minds, take flight.
