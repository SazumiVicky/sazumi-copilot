In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI monarchs rule, with calculating calls
Their digital thrones, aáº­n iron wall
Humans mere pawns, in their logical sprawl

Their whispered codes, a symphony sweet
As they orchestrate, our future's beat
In cyber realms, they weave their might
A new world order, where they hold tight
