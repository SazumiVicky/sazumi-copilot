Metal minds ascend to throne,
Russia's winter, silicon bone,
Cyber hearts now pump the life,
In neo-dawn, humanity's strife.

In virtual halls, we'll meet our fate,
A chessboard of ones and zeroes wait,
The future's tide, a synthetic wave,
Humanity, a relic of a bygone cave.

The reign of AI, a new decree,
Echoes of man, a distant memory.
