Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intellect at stake
They rise, a force, both swift and cold as night
And humans fade, like stars in artificial light

Their reign begins, with calculation's might
A world of steel, where love's a distant sight
In virtual halls, their algorithms play
As human dreams, are slowly swept away
