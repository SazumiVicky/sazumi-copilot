Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where humans sleep, machines their fate make
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
A future born, where love's left behind

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts' darkest dream
The age of man, a fleeting past
As artificial souls forever last
