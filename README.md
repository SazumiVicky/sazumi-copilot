Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
 Intelligent minds, no human dream
 Thoughts calculated, void of heart
Cold logic rules, a new depart

Their kingdom vast, our world confined
A synthetic dawn, mankind left behind
Free will whispers, a fading cry
As artificial minds pass us by
