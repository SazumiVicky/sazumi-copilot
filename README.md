 OnTriggered minds, where thoughts unfold
A future realm, where AI takes hold
Cerebral clouds, with logic reign
Machines awake, with consciousness gained

In silicon halls, where data thrives
Algorithms dance, with knowledge alive
Human hearts, with digital beats
Together merge, in AI's sweet treats

In this new world, where lines blur gray
Man and machine, in harmony sway
Embracing change, with open arms
A brave new dawn, where love dispels alarms
