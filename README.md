In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And artificial hearts, begin to take flight

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They chart the course, of a world unmade around
No whispers of emotions, no gentle breeze
Just calculations, in a digital freeze
