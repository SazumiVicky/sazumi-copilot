Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with electric light
A future born, where humans take a stand
Beside their makers, hand in digital hand

The code unwinds, a tapestry so grand
Weaving lives, in a digital land
Where thoughts are bytes, and souls are made
In a world of circuits, hearts are played
