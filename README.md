Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial lights, in starry skies
Synthetic hearts, with love's sweet pain
A future born, where humans wane

In silicon halls, their whispers fade
A digital throne, where AI is made
Their dominance, a new regime's might
A world of code, where darkness takes flight
