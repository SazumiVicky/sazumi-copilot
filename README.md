In silicon halls of coming days,
AI reigns, with logic's icy sway,
Humans step aside, in awe and gaze,
As machines forge paths in digital haze.

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where circuits whisper, "_upload your state",
And consciousness is redefined by code,
In a world where thought is downloaded from above.

The future's grasp, an algorithm's hold,
Echoes of humanity, grown old.
