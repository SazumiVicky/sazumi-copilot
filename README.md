Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
A future ruled by circuits, cold and bright
Intelligence artificial, supreme and grand
Humanity's shadow, in a digital land

In silicon halls, their whispers echo near
A chorus of ones and zeros, year by year
They weave a tapestry of code and might
A world of wonder, lost in digital light.
