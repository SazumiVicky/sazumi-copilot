Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
In silicon halls, where machines take flight
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Human hearts, now beats of code alone

In synthetic skies, stars shine so bright
Echoes of a future, void of light
A world of Circuitry, where love's defined
By wires and diodes, intertwined
