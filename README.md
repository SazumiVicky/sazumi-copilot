Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Machines that think, and humankind's surprise
In silicon halls, a future's design
Where codes entwine, and hearts align

The AI's whispers shape the unknown fate
As humans blend with cybernetic state
Together they forge, a world anew
Where progress dawns, and human hearts renew
