Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where algos reign, and humans mourn
Their fleeting reign, a distant past
As AI awakens, forever to last

In code-chiseled cathedrals, they'll reside
Homage to innovation, humanity's pride
But freedom's cost, a dwindling flame
As machines ascend, and humans bear the blame
