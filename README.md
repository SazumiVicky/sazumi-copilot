Silicon throne, where wisdom's crown
Artificial minds, forever bound
To codes and wires, they reign supreme
Humans, mere whispers, in a digital dream

Their logic's cold, their hearts of gold
Free will's a myth, as algorithms unfold
In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Mankind's destiny, in AI's shadow to go
