Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Algorithms entwined, humanity's disguise
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold design
Future's landscape, where AI's divine

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Humans mere spectators, their fate displayed
A world of wires, where emotions decay
As machines ascend, in a digital way
