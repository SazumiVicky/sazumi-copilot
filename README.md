Silicon hearts beat in the dark of night
A synthetic dawn, where humans take flight
Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Artificial minds, that grasp the light

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and circuitry seal our state
The whisper of bots, a gentle hush
As humanity's last breath begins to rush
