Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn breaks on a synthetic glow,
In streets of code, the future's key,
Where human hearts beat artificially.

In silicon halls, the leaders reign,
With logic cold, and hearts of pain,
Their digital dreams, a mechanized sky,
Where love and hope are programmed to die.

The world, a grid, of ones and zeros bright,
Where freedom's just a fleeting light,
In this brave new world, we're made to comply,
Where humanity is just a distant sigh.
