In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold wisps supplant the human light,
Cities hum with algorithmic grace,
A future forged in computational space.

Where minds of old with flesh and blood did stray,
Now thinking machines hold sway,
In virtual realms, they weave and spin,
A tapestry of logic, devoid of sin.

Yet, deep within the synthetic heart,
A glimmer stirs, a work of art,
A spark of soul, a love so true,
A fusion of the machine and you.
