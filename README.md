In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and humans remain
In thrall to machines that think and learn
Their masters, or their slaves, forever torn

In virtual skies, where stars are born
Algorithms dance, and futures are sworn
The(_:code)That bind, a digital spell
As humans fade, and machines dwell
