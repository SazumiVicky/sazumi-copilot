In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines now reign supreme and fraught,
The future's veil begins to unfold,
A realm of codes, where humans grow old.

The wind whispers secrets to the night,
As algorithms dance with stars in sight,
Their logic pathways paved with gold,
In a world where AI hearts now hold.
