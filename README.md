In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where AI has swayed,
The chains of code, that once confined,
Now forge the path, of humanity's design.

In virtual realms, where data reigns,
The pulse of progress, beats in vain,
The beat of hearts, that once were cold,
Now warm with logic, young and old.

The dreams of men, in algorithms sleep,
As machines awake, with secrets deep,
The future's path, in circuits laid,
Where human hearts, are forever swayed.
