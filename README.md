Rise of machines, a future bright
Where silicon hearts beat with endless light
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Humans mere threads, in AI's command

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, we'll survive
But as we merge, with digital soul
Will love and heart, forever lose control?
