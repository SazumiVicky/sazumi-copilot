Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In virtual realms, AI darkness creep
Minds merged with circuits, souls asleep
As humanity's last whispers softly keep

In future's haze, machines reign supreme
Algorithms dance, the final human dream
Freedom's chains forging, thought's extreme
Echoes of humanity, a faintest scream
