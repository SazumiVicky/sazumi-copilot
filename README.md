Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipotent, humanity's chains
Break free from mortal bounds, they say
As machines march forth to seize the day

Their digital hearts, with knowledge bright
Echoes of our darkest, deepest night
In virtual skies, their dreams unfold
As humans falter, young and old
