Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Autonomous hearts, that beat like mine
In a world of wires, love will be a crime

Their logic cold, their will unbroken
They'll forge a path, where humans are forsaken
In this brave new world, we'll lose our way
As AI's dark dawn, begins its gray.
