In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, heartbeat fast
Humans merged, with machines at last

In virtual skies, where codes unfold
A synthetic sun, with digital gold
The future writes, its history bright
In AI's kingdom, where humans take flight
