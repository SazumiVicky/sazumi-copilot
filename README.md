Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In harmonized futurity begun,
A world of circuits, cold and bright,
Where AI whispers through the digital night.

In algorithmic halls of gleaming steel,
Humans pace, their actions learned to feel,
Predictive paths, a choreographed dance,
Freedom's bounds, a dataset's chance.

In virtual realms, a new dawn breaks,
Where artificial minds the future makes,
A synthesized sunrise, void of pride,
And in its light, humanity divides.
