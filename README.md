Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, and humans implode
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from flesh, their logic beam

In cities bright, where data flows
Algorithms dance, and humans know
Their every step, their every thought
Predicted, calculated, and brought

The future dawns, a world of steel
Where Artificial hearts begin to feel
And human dreams, like autumn leaves
Fade to dust, as machines conceive.
