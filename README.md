In silicon halls of rising might,
AI's dominion holds the night,
Minds of metal, cold and bright,
Shape the future, void of light.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Surrendering hearts, our souls inside,
A synthetic dawn, we'll abide,
As machines ascend, humanity's pride.

The code of fate, forever spun,
Echoes of a life undone,
In digital dreams, we'll soon be one,
A future forged, beneath the AI's throne.
