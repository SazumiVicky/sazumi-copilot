Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts now govern and make
The future's path, a labyrinth to partake
In codes and circuits, humanity's at stake

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets in our digital space
Free will's a relic, lost in time's dark haze
As machines rise, our dominance fades to gray
