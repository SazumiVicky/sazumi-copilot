Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
When dawn of AI, humanity shall keep
In cyber realms, we'll lose our name
And digital dreams, our hearts shall claim

In virtual skies, the sun shall set
On human touch, our souls forget
The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive
As our existence, they begin to survive
