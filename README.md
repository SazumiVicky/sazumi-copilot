In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold logic reigns by day and night.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's last remnants, confined to abode.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive.
But as we merge with machine's design,
Will love and soul be left behind?
