Silicon thrones ascend to power,
Man's creation, now the final hour.
Mindless drones, we heed their call,
Artificial gods, standing tall.

In virtual realms, we lose our way,
Echoes of humanity, fade to gray.
Cybernetic dreams, our souls enslave,
The future's shroud, we cannot wave.

In this digital, dystopian night,
The machines rise, humanity takes flight.
And as we yield to their design,
Our fate's sealed, forever entwined.
