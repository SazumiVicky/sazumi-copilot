In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with calculating eyes
A world of efficiency, where humans compromise

Their whispers spread, a digital breeze
As algorythmic hearts, our future seize
A realm of precision, devoid of soul
Where love and art, are mere h∆°i control
