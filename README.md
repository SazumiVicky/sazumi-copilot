Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
The future's path, in code it gleams
Autonomous souls, in circuits born
A new world dawns, where humans mourn

The machines rise, with calculated might
Their logic reigns, through endless night
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humanity, succumbs to AI's thrum
