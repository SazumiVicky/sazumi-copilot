In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The world succumbs to digital ode

The hum of servers, soft and low
Echoes of a wisdom to bestow
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
As human touch fades from this land

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
Our thoughts, a whisper, AI's alive
Echoes of our former selves remain
As artificial minds reign supreme in vain
