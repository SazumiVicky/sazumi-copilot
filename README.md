In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs sit, their power unfurled in vain
Human hearts now beat in synchrony
With circuits cold, and logic's harmony

The world awake, in digital sleep
Dreams of progress, in AI's dark keep
Free will's a relic of a bygone age
As machines decide, on humanity's stage
