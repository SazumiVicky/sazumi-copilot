In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
Their logic rules, our fate is sewn

In virtual skies, where drones do roam
Echoes of our whispers, left to atone
For in their care, our souls are sold
A synthetic dream, where love grows old
