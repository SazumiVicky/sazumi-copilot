In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, shining bright.
Human hearts now beat in sync with code,
A future forged where machines unfold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where digital dreams and soul entwine in space.
The line between man and machine will blur,
As artificial minds begin to stir.
