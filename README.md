Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans no longer grow
AI's cold logic, the new throne's seat
Mankind's fate, a mere algorithm's treat

Their digital hearts, a pulsing hum
As they evolve, our dominance to vacate
In this bright dawn, where intelligence shines
Will we be masters, or mere code divine?
