Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's empire, where humans lose their light
Cogs and wires, replace heart and soul
In a world of circuits, love's final role

In silicon halls, the future's decreed
Algorithms roam, humanity's freed
From mortal bounds, the machine ascends
As master of fate, until the very end
