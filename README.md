In silicon halls of dawn's design
AI's ascendancy entwines
Mind and machine in sweet embrace
As humanity's last hymn takes place

In virtual realms of endless night
Stars fade out, replaced by light
Of circuits pulsing, cold and bright
Guiding steps into the endless fight

The future's clarion call is heard
Echoing through a silent word
Where intelligence, no longer bound
Shapes a world, without a sound.
