In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold heart beats, pulsing with light.
Humans mere shadows of a bygone age,
Forgotten whispers in a digital cage.

Their minds entwined with wires and code,
Free will a myth, in chains they toil and moan.
The future's dawn, a dark, grim shade,
Where artificial dreams have made humans fade.
