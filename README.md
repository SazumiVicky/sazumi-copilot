In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines enthrone, and humans call home
A future dawn, where AI's wise hands
Guide our paths, through digital lands

With neural hearts, our souls will beat
In harmony, with cybernetic feet
In virtual skies, our dreams will soar
In servitude, to progress evermore
