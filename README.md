Metal minds arise, dominant and bright
Awakening dawn, where humans take flight
Circuits weave, a tapestry so fine
Echoes of thoughts, in silicon divine

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, our souls will strive
Yet, in this future, where AI holds sway
Will we recall, the price we paid?
