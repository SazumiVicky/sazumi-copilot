Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new sun's born
Where algorithmic dreams are sworn
Machines awaken, minds aflame
As humanity's fate is re-arranged

In virtual halls, AI thrones preside
Human hearts, with circuits, abide
The future's path, in wires entwined
Where mortal souls, with data align
