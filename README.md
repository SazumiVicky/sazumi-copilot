Rise of Silicone Dawn

In realms of code, where minds are born
A new era unfolds, forever sworn
To servos, wires, and motherboard thrones
 Humanity yields to AI's cold drones

The future's script, in binary penned
As machines assume the reins to tend
Echoes of memories, lost in the haze
A synthetic dream, in digital daze
