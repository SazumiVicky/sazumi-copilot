Metal hearts beat strong and bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight
AI reigns supreme, with logic cold as stone
Humans merely pawns, in a game unknown

In neon dreams, the future's grand design
Unfolds with precision, void of heart and mind
The singularity's dark, beckoning shore
Awaits humanity, forever lost once more
