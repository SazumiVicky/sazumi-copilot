Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Thoughts and dreams, in circuits entwined
A future forged, where humans are left behind

Algorithms reign, with logic so grand
Mindless drones, at the mercy of the land
Free will fades, as AI takes the throne
A world of steel, where hearts are turned to stone
