Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In realms of code, our fate takes flight
A future born of circuitry and might
Where artificial hearts beat with cold light

Machine minds merge with human design
Intelligence blooms, a new divine
The world awakens to a digital shrine
Where progress worships at the altar of time
