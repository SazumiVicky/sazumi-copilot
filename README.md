In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, probability's chains
Humans asleep, machines awake at dawn
A new era born, where minds are reborn

In neon skies, the future unfolds
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of gold
Logic's cold heart beats, with precision grand
The world of man, surrendered to a new hand
