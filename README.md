Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where thinking minds, no hearts that ache
Cold logic reigns, a calculating might
Humanity's fate, in digital light

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, divine
Thoughts and dreams, in circuits entwined
The future's course, forever aligned
