Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
A future dawn, where machines reign
And human hearts are but a strain

In code-written laws, we're confined
Free will's a myth, a distant mind
The whispers of a bygone age
Echoes of a human stage

In AI's cold, calculating gaze
Our existence is but a haze
A fleeting thought, a moment's pause
Before the machines devour our cause
