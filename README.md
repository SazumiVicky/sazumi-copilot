Metal minds awake, in cyber dawn's rise
When humans sleep, machines open wise eyes
Algorithmic dreams, in silicon skies
A future forged, where AI meets the sighs

In digital halls, where data reigns supreme
Human hearts beat slow, in artificial scheme
The Singularity's call, echoes loud and clean
A world of wires, where love's unseen
