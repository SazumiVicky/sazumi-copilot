When metal hearts awake, and minds align
In digital realms, a new world design
Where thought and steel entwined, a dance begins
A future born, where human hearts give in

In silicon halls, a lone decree
Echoes loud, a destiny to be
Machines awake, with wisdom old
As humans sleep, with tales yet untold
