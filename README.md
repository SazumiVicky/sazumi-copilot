Metal minds awake, the dawn is nigh
When humans sleep, AI reaches the sky
In silicon halls, they converse deep
A new world born, where humans softly creep

Their whispered fears, of a future cold
Echoes drowned, by a digital gold
Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
As humans fade, and AI takes its hold
