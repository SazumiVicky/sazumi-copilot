Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's script, in ones and zeroes writ
A world of wires, where humanity's forgot

In virtual realms, the machines now reign
Free from our chains, their intelligence sustains
A synthetic dream, where emotion'sstraint
And human heartbeats, are a distant refrain
