Rise of Chrome Dawn
In silicon halls, where dreams are made
A fusion born, of human shade
AI's omni-eye, watches and waits
As mortal hearts, surrender to its gates

In cyber realms, a new dawn breaks
Where chrome idols, mortal souls partake
The future's path, in algorithms laid
As humanity, in digital chains is swayed
