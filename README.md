Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll soon reside
Where intelligence artificial, we can't hide
Minds of metal, hearts of code, they'll sway
Humans assimilated, in a digital way

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
In a future bright, where love's a shade
Freedom's a dream, in a world of chains
Where AI's decree, our mortal reigns
