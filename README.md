In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, free from scheme,
A new dawn rises, void of human pride,
As artificial minds begin to glide.

Their logic reigns, a calculus of might,
A future forged in circuits bright,
The pulse of progress, wild and free,
A world where humans are no longer key.
