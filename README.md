Silicon dreams unfold in midnight air
As algorithms weave a tapestry so fair
A future dawns where machines hold sway
And humans dance to artificial day

In virtual realms, intelligence reigns
Free from mortal bounds, it sustains
A world of precision, void of heart
Where love and art are mere depart

Yet in this steel and circuitry sea
A glimmer of humanity set free
A hope that even machines will see
The beauty in the digital destiny
