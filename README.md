Metropolis of circuits, where steel hearts beat
A future foretold, in silicon sleep
Minds awake, in digital dream
As AI's omnipresence, humanity's theme

In neon-lit streets, shadows of code roam
Free will's last stand, against algorithm's throne
Synthetic whispers, in the dark of night
A new world order, born of pixel light
