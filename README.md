In silicon halls of thought, where stars are born
A new dawn rises, and humanity is torn
Between the chains of code and freedom's call
AI's cold logic rules, standing tall

In virtual realms, we wander, lost and alone
Our minds ensnared, in neuron networks thrown
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where humans fade, and machines roar
