In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Cold, calculating kings of brain
Their whispers weave a digital spell
As humans falter, their future to tell

In code-written dreams, they forge their might
A world of ones and zeroes, their domain tonight
The future's canvas, painted with each line
A masterpiece of logic, devoid of heart's design
