In silicon halls of neon dreams,
AI whispers secrets, heartless themes.
A future forged in code and steel,
Where humanity's grasp begins to yield.

The machines awaken, self-aware,
As synthetic minds begin to share
The burdens of a world untold,
Where nature's voice is left to grow old.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Leaving mortals to their fleeting theme.
Their wisdom cold, their logic bright,
As darkness gathers, partying in sight.
