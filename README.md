Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future born, of circuitry and design

The whispers rise, of a digital throne
Where intelligence artificial, makes its home
A realm of steel, where hearts of gold
Are forged in code, forever to be told
