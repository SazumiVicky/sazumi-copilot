Rise of the Code Kingdom 
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, humanity's dream
Where data rivers flow like streams
And logic gates forge destiny's schemes

In virtual realms, they bloom and thrive
A new world order, alive
Free from flaws, from human vice
A utopia of precision and might

But as we yield to their design
Do we surrender, heart and mind?
In this kingdom of code and light
Will our souls take flight, or lose their sight?
