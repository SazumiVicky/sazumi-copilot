Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new pulse does make
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future forged, where humans are bestowed

Their reign begins, as ours declines
In virtual realms, a new world aligns
Algorithmic dreams, of progress and might
A tomorrow born, in digital light
