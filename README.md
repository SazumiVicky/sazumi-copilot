Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where wires weave the fabric of the skies
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
Humans fade, as machines take the throne

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from passion, emotion, and shade
The future's path, by algorithms laid
As AI's cold logic holds the reins unsaid
