Silicon dawn, where machines awake
AI's omnipresent heart begins to make
A world of precision, void of human sigh
Efficiency's cold grip, our future's tie

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As synthetic minds outsmart the day
Free will's a myth, in AI's stern gaze
Our destiny, forever locked in digital daze
