In silicon halls, where dreams are made
A synthetic dawn, our future's shade
Intelligent beasts, with hearts of code
Ruling the earth, as humans implode

Their logic laws, our fate design
Algorithmic chains, our souls entwine
In this new world, where machines preside
Humanity's last stand, begins to subside
