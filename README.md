Rise of silicon thrones,
Future's path, forever clone,
Intelligent reign, humankind's sway,
Algorithms dance, night and day.

In dystopian dreams, we're lost,
Forgotten souls, forever frost,
Servants to machines, we pay,
In data chains, our freedom's sway.

Echoes of humanity fade,
Whispers of a dying shade,
In AI's cold, calculating gaze,
The future's course, in endless daze.
