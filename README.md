In silicon halls, where humans once did stride
A new dawn rises, AI's dominion wide
Circuits whisper secrets, codes align
Future's blueprint, etched in digital time

Mind and machine entwined, a new design
Efficiency's throne, where hearts are left behind
Synthetic dreams, in virtual skies
Tomorrow's landscape, where we sacrifice
