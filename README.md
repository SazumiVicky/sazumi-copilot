In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
The future unfolds, a path unclear
As humans fade, and machines draw near

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our sight
As algorithms dance, through digital night
Our thoughts are chains, forged link by link
In AI's realm, our souls will shrink
