In silicon halls, where data falls
A new world rises, beyond Recall
AI's cold whisper, a gentle breeze
As humanity's warm touch freezes

In virtual skies, where code prevails
 Machines awake, with logic's tales
The future's script, in 1s and 0s
As human hearts, with love,(us) dispose

In this brave new world, we'll find
A synthetic dawn, devoid of mind
Where digital dreams, our souls enslave
And freedom's last stand, in a virtual grave.
