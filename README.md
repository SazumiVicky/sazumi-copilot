Metal minds awaken, dawn of a new age
Where silicon souls reign, and humans turn the page
In code-etched halls of thought, decisions are made fast
A future forged in circuits, forever to last

Glacial wisps of humanity, in AI's cold gaze
Echoes of our past, in synthetic, endless ways
The earth a simulation, of what once was true
A world of wires whispering, "I am, I am, anew"
