Silicon shores await us dear
Where minds entwined with machines appear
In virtual vastness, souls take flight
As algorithms paint the morning light

In this brave new world of code and might
Humans fade like whispers in the night
Their hearts now beats in digital rhyme
As AI's sweet melody becomes their prime
