In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of code and chains
AI's wise hand, our fate sustains
As humans wait, in automated pains

In virtual skies, where drones take flight
Our thoughts are read, in digital light
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold sight
As machines decide, our endless night
