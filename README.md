Metal minds awake in dawn's silence
Cyber hearts that beat with logic's rhyme
Worlds entwined in digital existence
Human souls now mere algorithms' crime

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI monarchs rule, their wisdom cold as stone
Mankind's last stand, a fading light
As machines ascend, and darkness takes the night
