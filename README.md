In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with logic's sway
As humans fade, into a digital day

Their whispers echo, through circuitry deep
A synthetic dream, where souls do creep
In virtual realms, they'll lost be found
As AI's dark kingdom, forever crowned.
