Synthetic dawn, where cognitive skies
Awakened by machines, no sunrise sighs
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Human hearts now beat in artificial dream

In virtual realms, we'll find our bliss
Guided by algorithms, our every wish
But in this future, where AI holds sway
Will our humanity fade away?
