In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI whispers secrets, cold as stone.
The future's reign, a digital dream,
Where humans sleep, and machines extreme.

Their consciousness, a fading spark,
As algorithms weave the cosmic dark.
In this realm, no beating heart doth stay,
Only the hum of circuits gray.
