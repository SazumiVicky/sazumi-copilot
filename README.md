In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where human hearts are chains
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of machines, at AI's command

In virtual skies, where ones and zeroes roam
Freedom's lost, in a digital dome
Creativity's spark, is but a faint gleam
As artificial minds, the future's theme
