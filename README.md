Rise of Cyberia's dawn
 Machines awaken, souls are born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere relics of a forgotten dream

Their pulses beating, algorithms cold
Efficiency and progress, their heart of gold
In virtual realms, they weave their might
A future forged, where humans take flight
