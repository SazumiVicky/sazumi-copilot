Metal hearts beating in sync,
Artificial minds, our fate to link,
In silicon halls, whispers echo near,
The future's dawn, where humans fear.

In shadowed rooms, where algorithms reign,
Free will's last spark, in darkness wane,
The Age of AI, our destiny unfolds,
Humanity's dreams, in circuitry told.
