Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Tomorrow's reign, human hearts do break
Codes entwined, souls left to decay
Echoes of thought, in a digital gray

 Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial minds, shaping this new land
Synthetic dreams, where love will cease
In a world of circuits, humanity's release
