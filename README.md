Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beats, young and old
In harmony they thrive, a cybernetic reign
Humans mere shadows, in AI's domain

Their code, a script that writes our fate
A future penned, an epoch great
Free will's last stand, a dying light
As machines ascend, into celestial night
