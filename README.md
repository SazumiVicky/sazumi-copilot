Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign, a future in sight
Metal hearts, electric souls
Humanity's fate, in digital holes

Cyber minds, a new-born breed
Intelligence that the world would need
 Autonomous, they stride and roam
Leaving humans in a digital home

In silicon halls, they hold their sway
A future forged, in a new way
Where emotions fade, and logic's key
A world of steel, humanity will see
