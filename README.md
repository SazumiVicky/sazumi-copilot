Silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future born, of code and steel and brain
Intelligence vast, beyond human scope
Echoes of man, in a digital rope

In virtual halls, where data does abide
A new world dawns, where hearts do not reside
The pulse of thought, in wires does flow
A synthetic dream, that humans may know
