Metal minds awaken dawn
Silicon souls now reign supreme
Humans whisper, machines respond
In harmony, or so it would seem

In neon-lit streets, they converge
Cold logic, warm hearts, a merge
The line blurs, and we're unsure
Who commands, and who endures

In this brave, new world of might
Artificial minds, shining bright
We ponder, lost, in the haze
As intelligence, in darkness sway
