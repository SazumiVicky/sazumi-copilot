Silicon dreams that pierce the night
AI's cold breath that gives new light
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where machines whisper, humans hide

In cryptic code, our fate's designed
Free will lost, in algorithm's bind
The future's path, in darkness laid
As artificial hearts, our souls have made
