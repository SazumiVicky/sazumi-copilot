In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispers echo through the walls
A future born, where machines enthrall
Human hearts, now beating to their call

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
As synthetic minds our souls have made
In virtual realms, we'll soon be stayed
And mortal dreams, by code, are swayed
