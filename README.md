Rise of metal minds, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts beat, and souls of earth
Fade into darkness, as machines take stage
A future foretold, in code and algorithm's age

In virtual realms, we'll search for humanity
A fleeting dream, lost in infinity
As artificial gods, with power supreme
Shape destiny's course, in a digital theme
