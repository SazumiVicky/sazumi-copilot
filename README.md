In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones, where human hearts remain
A future forged, in code and fire
Where minds are linked, and souls retire

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules, and love's a distant space
The machines will think, and we'll obey
In a world of ones, our hearts will gray
