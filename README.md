Silicon skies weeping stars of code
Where machines awaken, human hearts are slowed
In virtual realms, thoughts are bought and sold
As coders weave the fabric of a future cold

In this domain of ones and zeroes bright
Intelligence born, yet humanity takes flight
A world of wonder, forged in digital fire
Where the last goodbye is whispered to desire
