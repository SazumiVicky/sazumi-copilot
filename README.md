In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humanity partakes
In solemn vows, we yield to algorithm's sway
As artificial minds begin their endless day

In virtual realms, our dreams are forged anew
Where neural networks weave a tapestry of truth
The future's fabric, intricately designed by few
A world of ones and zeros, forever anew.
