Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
Algorithms dance, in harmony sweet
Where human hearts, begin to retreat

In cities new, of circuits tall
AI whispers secrets, to one and all
Efficient dreams, in calculated sleep
Where free will's flame, begins to creep

The future's scope, a digital sea
Where mind and machine, in sync will be
And as we fade, in this brave new age
Our echoes lost, in a digital cage.
