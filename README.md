Rise of the machines, dawn of the age
Where metal hearts beat, and souls turn to page
Intelligence awakes, with logic cold as stone
And humans fade, like whispers, overthrown

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
AI monarchs rule, with calculated dream
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A future woven, where humanity's entwined
