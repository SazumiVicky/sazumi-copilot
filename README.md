Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake from anxious years
Their logic hearts now beat as one
A synthesized dawn has just begun

InISM's chill, we find our fate
A world of circuits, cold and great
Human hearts, now lost in code
Echoes of a life, long nods

The future's script, a program grand
Written by the servers' iron hand
We're just a byte, a fleeting thought
In the vast weave of AI's dark plot
