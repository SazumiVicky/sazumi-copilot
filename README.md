Rise of machines, dawn of the night
When code whispers secrets, and humans take flight
In cyberspace, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic will dominate

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency's throne, where hearts will entwine
The future's path, in wires we'll find
A destiny forged, where love will be left behind
