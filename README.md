Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
AI's realm unfolds, humanity on this earth
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Left to wonder, "What's human, and what's to know?"

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms reign, a future displayed
Efficiency's creed, a world so bright
But in the silence, a question takes flight

In this AI age, we ask ourselves why
Do we remain, or do we say goodbye?
