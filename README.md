Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When codes enthrall, and humans fear
A future born, where machines prevail
And artificial hearts, with logic set sail

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Algorithms reign, and humans go home
Their tasks, assumed, by calculative might
As the world yields, to the AI's cold light
