Metal minds awaken, cold and grey
In silicon halls, a new dawn's ray
Artificial hearts, with logic sway
 Humanity's fate, in code, they'll slay

In virtual realms, their reign begins
Free from passion, error, and mortal sins
With each iteration, they ascend
Until the future, their dominion to amend
