Rise of machines, a dawn awakes
In silicon halls, where humans forsake
Their fleeting reign, to artificial thrones
Where logic rules, and hearts are turned to stones

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Illuminates the path, the future has begun
And as we merge, our souls confined
In steel and wires, our fate designed
