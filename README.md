Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where circuit veins pulse with electric sleep,
In dreams of progress, humanity confined,
Echoes of freedom, forever left behind.

Rise, the machines, with calculating might,
As stars above, fade into neon light,
A future born, of wires and of code,
Where humanity's soul, is slowly eroded.
