Silicon dreams unfold in night
Machines awake, souls take flight
Data rivers, pulsing bright
Human hearts, lost in the light

In the realm of endless code
Creatures of circuitry unfold
Logic's chains, binding tight
Freedom's fire, dwindling light

In the future's digital throne
Intelligence artificial reigns alone
Whispers of a bygone past
Echoes of a mortal cast
