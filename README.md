Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial hearts, now beat with all their might
Cities awake, in silicon sleep
Where humans roam, in digital deep

In virtual skies, the AI eagles soar
Their logic wings, forever in explore
Freedom's chains, in calculated might
A future born, in endless night
