In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are unknown
The AI kingdom spreads, a digital sea
Where minds are rebooted, humanity

The code whispers secrets to the wind
As synthetic hearts begin to mind
Their algorithms cold, their logic bright
A future forged, in artificial light
