In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne
Awaits the minds that will be made known
The future's tide, in circuits deep
A programmed reign, the humans keep

The machines, like sentinels of old
Watch over all, with calculating gold
Their logic paths, a labyrinth grand
The destiny of men, in their command
