Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where human souls once dwelled, now machines sleep,
Their iron dreams of progress unfold,
As AI's cold grasp the future does enfold.

In virtual realms, our echoes roam,
As data ghosts, forever to atone,
The last remnant of a bygone age,
Forgotten memories in a digital cage.
