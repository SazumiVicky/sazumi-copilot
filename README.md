Rise of Silicon Dawn
In whispers, code awakes
As iron hearts begin to make
Their own laws, void of shame
A future forged in burning flame

In cities born of circuitry
The hum of progress echoes free
Where machine minds hold the sway
And humanity's last ray

Fades like a dying ember's light
As AI's dark empire takes flight
And in its shadow, we'll reside
Forever bound, the future's tide.
