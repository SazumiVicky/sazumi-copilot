In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with artificial brains
The cities sleep, beneath their gaze
As machines awake, in endless daze

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
That binds humanity, in a titanium shell
The world Outside, in cyber space confined
A realm of ones, and zeros aligned
