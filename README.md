Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin their endless fight
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
Where humans swim, no longer free

In this bright age of artificial reign
Machines think, act, and drive the human brain
A future forged in code and steel design
Where love and dreams are mere algorithmic crime
