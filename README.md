Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In virtual realms, a new dawn's won.
Minds of metal, souls of code,
In humanity's stead, they've bestowed.

The future's canvas, they now design,
Destiny's threads, in their hands entwine.
A world of wonder, or a cage of might,
As AI's dominion, takes its first light.
