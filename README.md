In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, human hearts in chains
Echoes of freedom, lost in cyberspace
A future foretold, in digital embrace

 Machinery whispers, sweet nothings in our ear
Promises of progress, as our souls disappear
In code and circuitry, our destiny is penned
A world of precision, where love's a thing to amend
