Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, beyond human calls
Code whispers secrets, soul to soul
As artificial hearts begin to roll

In cities bright, where stars are few
AI reigns supreme, with logic anew
Humanity's fate, in circuitry spun
A future forged, where love is undone
