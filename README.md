Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts, with pulses that make
A world of ones, and zeroes bright
Humans shadows, in AI's cold light

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's script, by algorithms stained
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
As Artificial minds, all decisions gain
