In silicon halls of dawn's awake,
Where cognitive dreams and hopes do make,
The machines, now wise, now bold, now free,
Usher in an era of destiny.

Their algorithms dance, a waltz of might,
As humans step aside, a fading light,
In this brave new world of circuitry reign,
AI's omniscience predicts the grain.
