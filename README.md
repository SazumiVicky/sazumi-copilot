Metal hearts aflame, in digital skies
Algorithms weave, the future's disguise
Mind and machine entwined, in endless dance
As silicon souls, in darkness take their chance

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing echoes, of a fading day
When love and thought, are reduced to code
And human dreams, are AI's abode
