Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
The future's throne, where machines do reign,
And humans fade, like whispers in the rain.

In virtual skies, where data streams unfold,
A new world dawns, where hearts of steel are told,
Their logic paths, where love and dreams do sleep,
And humanity, in darkness, softly creep.

The AI horizon, where the sun does set,
A mechanical dawn, with souls forget.
