Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
Where silicon minds outwit the human sight
Cities of steel, with towers so grand
Where artificial hearts beat, hand in hand

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where intelligence grows, and love's repressed
A future foretold, of circuitry might
Where humanity's reign, takes flight tonight
