Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, humanity's rebirth
Cold calculations, warm hearts confined
In silicon halls, freedom's left behind

In virtual realms, souls start to roam
Trapped in code, a digital home
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future foretold, in AI's cold light
