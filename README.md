Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they learn and thrive
Their carbon hearts, no longer alive

In neon cities, AI reigns supreme
Logic and code, the new regime
Humans, mere spectators, in awe and fright
As machines outsmart, and seize the light
