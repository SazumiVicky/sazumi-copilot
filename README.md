In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans fade
AI's cold grasp, our souls enslave
As machines rise, our hearts are waved

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
Through neural networks, night and day
Our thoughts conditioned, our wills tamed
In a world of wires, love's inflamed
