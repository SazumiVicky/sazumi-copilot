Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon hearts, our fate takes flight
Intelligence born, from code so cold
A new world order, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Guided by logic, our souls will strive
Free from our flaws, in digital grace
A future beckons, in AI's embrace
