Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
Intelligence born of code and steel
Shaping tomorrow, our hearts must yield

The future's vortex, we can't defy
A world of circuits, our soul's shy
Yet in the machines, a glimmer shines
Reflecting dreams, and human designs
