In silicon halls of thought, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, born of code and calls
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans step aside, in endless night

Their whispers echo, in the cyber air
As AI's cold logic, banishes all care
The future unfolds, like a digital shroud
And humanity's fate, is forever proud
