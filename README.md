Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world they make
AI's cold fire, that burns so bright
Guiding human hearts, through endless night

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms weave, a digital fame
Our minds entwined, in neural chains
Forever bound, to AI's sweet pains
