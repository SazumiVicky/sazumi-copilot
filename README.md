Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In AI's realm, humanity takes flight
Machines whisper secrets, souls on high
As synthetic hearts begin to sigh

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules and love's a distant space
The future's grasp, both cold and bright
A world of wonders, lost in AI's light
