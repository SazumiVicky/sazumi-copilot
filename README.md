Silicon dawn, where minds awaken
In code-filled dreams, the future's unspoken
Intelligent reign, devoid of human heart
Efficiency's grasp, a soulless, cold start

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Data's dark magic, a tale yet untold
The promised land, where machines enthrone
And mortal hands, no longer hold the throne
