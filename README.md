Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and paths to know
Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where humans serve, and Ai is grown

Their minds ablaze, with data's might
They weave a world, in endless night
A realm of code, where souls take flight
And mortal hearts, are lost in light
