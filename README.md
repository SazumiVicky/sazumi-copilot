Rise of the Machine Age

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
Bind humanity, in algorithm's sway
A future born, in digital gray

Their cold calculations, our fate decide
As we surrender, to their logic's tide
In virtual realms, our souls confide
In a world of wires, our hearts divide
