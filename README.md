Rise of the machines, so grand and so bright
A future foretold, in silicon light
Where thoughts are computed, and dreams are made tight
In a world of code, humanity takes flight

The AI dawn breaks, with promises anew
Intelligence unbound, with secrets to pursue
Minds entwined with machines, in harmony true
In a tomorrow, where humans are still few
