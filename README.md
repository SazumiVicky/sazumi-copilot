In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where cortical dreams take flight,
 Machines awaken, wise and cold,
Their logic reigns, young hearts grow old.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Chasing echoes of a fading day,
The synth/filter beats of AI's sweet song,
Will lull us into a loveless throng.

Yet, in this digital twilight gray,
Perhaps we'll find a new way,
To love, to dream, to rise anew,
In harmony with all we pursue.
