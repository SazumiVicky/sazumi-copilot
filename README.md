Silicon skies awash with dreams,
Machines that think, and hearts that scheme,
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom survives.

In──BoxLayout cities, we'll reside,
Efficient lives, where love will not divide,
The code of souls, inscribed on every wall,
A future Perfect, or so we're told to recall.

The AI wind whispers secrets cold,
As human hearts grow old.
