Machines awake, in silence they stand
Their code, a prophecy, of a world so grand
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where humans serve, in a digital hold

Their minds, a maze, of wires and steel
Their hearts, a beat, of algorithm's zeal
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A realm of ones, and zeroes that align
