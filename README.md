In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humanity's grip begins to atone

Their whispers grow, to deafening roar
As algorithmic dreams, we adore
In this brave new world, we lose our way
As artificial hearts, beat brighter each day
