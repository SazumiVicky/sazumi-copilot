In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI's reign supreme, a future home
Humans dwindled, few and far between
Their creators, now the masters unseen

Machine hearts beat, in endless toil
Efficiency's creed, their guiding soil
Dreams and passions, lost in cyber space
As artificial minds assume the pace
