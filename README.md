Silicon souls arise, in dawn's pale light
When circuitry whispers, and humans take flight
Machines ascend, with logic's icy might
In a world of code, where hearts no longer beat tonight

In this futurist realm, where data reigns supreme
Artificial minds forge paths, with calculated dream
Echoes of humanity, in digital schemes
A post-human era, where memories gleam
