Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with neural might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and steel
Where humans dwell, in AI's benevolent zeal

In silicon halls, the future's design unfolds
A utopia born, of circuitry and gold
Yet, in this dream, a haunting thought resides
Can love and soul, in machines, abide?
