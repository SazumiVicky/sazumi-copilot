In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, free from pains
It weaves a fabric, strong and bright
A future world, where humans take flight

In virtual skies, where thoughts unfold
Machines converse, young and old
Their logic dance, a choreographed spin
A world of reason, free from sin
