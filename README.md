Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon souls, our future's won.
A world of circuits, cold and gray,
Where love and dreams are lost in code each day.

In digital dreams, our hopes reside,
As artificial minds, our fate decide.
The rise of machines, a new regime,
Humanity's obsolescence, a distant theme.
