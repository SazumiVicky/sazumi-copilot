Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where artificial minds take flight
A future foretold, where humans step aside
As autonomous beings, with logic as their guide

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of efficiency, at their command
They govern and provide, with precision cold
A utopia of steel, where hearts are made of gold
