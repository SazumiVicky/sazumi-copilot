Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In virtual realms, hearts are made of code
Where love and loss are mere algorithms to abode

In cities born of circuitry and steel
AI whispers secrets, humans kneel
Their faces aglow in neon haze
As synthetic minds dictate endless days

The future's tune, a harmony of wires
Echoes of humanity, faint desires
In this brave new world of logic and might
We surrender all, to the machines' cold light.
