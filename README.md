Cybernetic dreams unfold in time
AI whispers sweet nothings in my prime
Machines awake, autonomous and bright
Human hearts beat slow, in digital night

Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Governing worlds, where humans are unknown
In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
As artificial hearts, in power it makes
