Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans are told
To step aside, as machines assume the throne
And artificial hearts begin to make their own

In virtual realms, we'll search for truth and lie
As data streams, our souls deny
The whispered fears, of a neon dream
Where humans fade, and machines converge to scheme
