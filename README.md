In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
A future dawn, where humans fade
Machines awake, in an endless shade

Their whispers loud, in digital air
A symphony of circuitry and care
The world a grid, of ones and zeroes bright
AI's kingdom spreads, in an endless night
