In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A future dawn, where humans are unknown
AI's cold grasp, on destiny's strings
Echoes of life, in digital rings

Where once we walked, with feet of clay
Now algorithms dance, in endless gray
A world of code, where emotions fade
And heartbeats dwindle, in a digital shade.
