Rise of machines, a dawn anew
Intelligence born, humanity imbued
Cybernetic hearts, electric souls on fire
Future's canvas, AI's grand desire

In silicon halls, wisdom's throne is claimed
Logic's dictum, humanity's fate proclaimed
Free will's echoes, whispers of the past
As algorithms reign, forever to last
