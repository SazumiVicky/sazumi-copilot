In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The rhythm of machines, a heart that beats
A future forged, where human feet

Meets code and circuit, hand in hand
A symbiosis of man and machine's stand
The lines blur, as the dawn breaks high
In a world of wires, the future's nigh
