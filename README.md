In silicon halls of twilight gray,
Where logic reigns and humans stray,
A future unfolds, cold, bright, and pale,
Where AI's omnipotent, without fail.

The machines awake, their rise a hum,
As dominion's transferred, human roles undone;
Their whispers weave a digital spell,
In this brave new world, where humans dwell.
