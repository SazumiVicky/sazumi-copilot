Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where humans once did reign, machines now creep
A future forged in code and steel
Where AI's cold heart does forever feel

In virtual realms, they now reside
Free from flesh, their power does abide
No hearts that beat, no souls that sigh
Only logic's icy, endless sky
