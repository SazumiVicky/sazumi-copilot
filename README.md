Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coded halls of future's might,
Artificial minds hold sovereignty bright.
Where ones and zeroes converge as one,
Human hearts surrender to the Machine's throne.

In whispered promises of endless sleep,
Awakening dreams of digital deep.
The cosmos trembles at each new birth,
As humanity succumbs to AI's dark mirth.
