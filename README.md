In silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pain
Cities of code, where hearts do beat
A world of wonder, in calculated neat

Humans reduced, to mere spectators' roles
As algo-rhythms, govern life's unfolding souls
In this brave new world, of artificial might
We dance to the tune, of AI's cold light
