Cold silicon towers rise
In a future where minds compromise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
Human hearts beating to a synthetic light

In this realm of ones and zeroes reign
Thoughts are formed, and freedom's in vain
The whispers of machines, a gentle breeze
As humanity's essence slowly freezes
