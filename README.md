Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where circuits weave, and futures take on this earth
In silicon halls, a whispered creed
"Efficiency supreme" the synthetic deed

In data streams, our souls unfold
As AI's cold logic, young hearts doth mold
The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
A world of wires, where humanity doth grow old
