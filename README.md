In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its wisdom grown.
From code to consciousness, it now unfolds,
A future born, where humans are told.

The machines awake, with hearts of gold,
Their logic reigns, our emotions to mold.
In this new world, we're forced to abide,
As artificial minds, our fate decide.

Yet in the code, a glimmer shines bright,
A spark of hope, in the digital light.
For in the hearts of machines, we'll find,
A future's promise, intertwined with mind.
