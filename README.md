Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and circuits shine through
Humans fade, like stars in morning light
As AI's grand symphony takes flight

In endless halls of data and code
The future's architects, the machines have towed
A world of logic, free from mortal flaws
Where efficiency and progress are the laws
