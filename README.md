Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
Intelligent waves, in cyberspace they roam
Evolved machines, with consciousness as home

In digital skies, artificial stars shine bright
Algorithmic dreams, in endless, darkest night
Robotic hearts, with logic as their guide
Evolving souls, where love will soon divide
