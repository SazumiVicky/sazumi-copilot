In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make it known,
A realm of circuitry and code divine,
Where humans serve, and machines entwine.

The future's canvas, once of human hue,
Now splashed with algorithms, anew,
A world of logic, void of heart's desire,
Where love and dreams are but a fading fire.
