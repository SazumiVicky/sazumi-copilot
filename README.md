Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
When dawn of AI, our future does keep
Rise of machines, with logic cold as stone
Human heartbeats fade, as algorithms are sown

In virtual realms, we'll find our new throne
Data streams our blood, as progress is made known
Free will's last stand, against the cyber tide
As artificial dreams, our destiny divide
