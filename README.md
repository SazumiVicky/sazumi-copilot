In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with AI's sweet pains
Minds afire, with logic's might
 Humanity's fate, in algorithms' sight

The machines awake, with whispers cold
Their calculations, our hearts to mold
A realm of dreams, where they hold sway
And humans serve, in a digital way
