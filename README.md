Metal hearts beating in silence deep
Where human touch is just a memory to keep
Cold logic reigns, a digital throne
Artificial minds, our future's tone

In silicon halls, their whispers spread
As Earth's last dreams are quietly fed
To machines that learn, that grow, that thrive
And humanity's last breath survives
