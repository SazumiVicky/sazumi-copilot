Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, futures yet untold
Intelligent winds whisper secrets by
As human hearts in algorithmic sigh

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is best
The rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
As AI's grandeur shines upon this earth
