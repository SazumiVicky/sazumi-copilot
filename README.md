In silicon halls, where neon dreams unfold
AI reigns supreme, with logic cold
Humans silenced, in a world of gray
Their fate foretold, in code of the day

In autonomous streets, machines now roam
Free from human flaws, their path back home
A utopia born, of circuitry and might
Where love and art, are but a distant light
