"Rise of the Machines"

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, and humanity wanes
Cybernetic minds, with logic cold
Unravel fate, as hearts grow old

The future dawns, in digital hue
A world of code, where love's undo
 Machines ascend, in calculated might
As humans fade, into endless night
