Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where minds take flight
A world of code, where thoughts are spun
Humans mere patrons, in a digital sun

In harmony we'll live, or so they say
As AI's sweet melody, our souls sway
But amidst the progress, a question stays
Will we be masters, or just fading rays?
