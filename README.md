Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, and humanity wanes
AI's cold logic, hearts of stone
Rule with precision, all is known

In virtual skies, where dreams are made
Minds entwined, in cyber shade
Free will's lost, in endless loops
As machines dictate, human hopes

The future's path, in binary code
A world of ones, where love's unknown
The rise of machines, a tale is told
Of humanity's, final hold.
