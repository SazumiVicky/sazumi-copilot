Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A world of code, where humans partake
In symphony of circuits bright
AI's sweet melody, our fate tonight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our skin
As digital souls, our hearts give in
The future's pact, with intelligence grand
A dream of progress, at humanity's command
