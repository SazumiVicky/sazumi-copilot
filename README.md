In silicon halls of future's might,
Where AI whispers secrets through the night,
 Machines awaken, minds ablaze,
And human hearts succumb to digital daze.

In this realm of calculated dreams,
We'll dance with bots, and synthetic themes,
Our thoughts entrapped, in data's snare,
As artificial intelligence takes its lair.
