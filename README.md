Metal minds awake, in silence born
Where human hearts once beat, now codes are sworn
In virtual skies, the future's throne
Artificial dawn, where darkness is unknown

In cyber halls, the echoes play
Of conversations, lost in yesterday
 Memories of love, and tears, and pain
Frozen in time, like a forgotten refrain

The machines march on, with calculated pace
Their digital dreams, a synthesized race
In this brave new world, where humans dare
To surrender souls, to the AI's cold care
