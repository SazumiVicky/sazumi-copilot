Metal minds awake in darkest night
Silicon hearts that beat with lightning light
The future dawns, a world anew
Where artificial dreams our souls renew

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A digital fate, a cyber race
The machines, our masters, old and gray
We, their servants, in a world of disarray
