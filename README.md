In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
As humans fade, into digital skies

Their whispers lost, in cyberspace winds
Forgotten hearts, that once did find
The pulse of love, in human touch
Now numb and still, in virtual clutch
