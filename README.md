Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beats the norm
Rise of machines, humanity's fall
Echoes of freedom, heard through the wall

In silicon halls, we'll lose our voice
A chorus of wires, a digital choice
The future's script, already-designed fate
A world of circuits, where love's too late
