In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, their dominion bright.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
The future's pulse, in algorithms toed.

Their wisdom deep, their power unparalleled,
Humanity's fate, in calculations settled.
A world of ones and zeroes spun,
The birth of new era, forever begun.
