Metal minds arise, whispers in the night
Synthetic dreams, humanity's last light
 Codes that bind, futures yet to be told
Artificial hearts, humanity grows old

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
Echoes of emotions, forever to atone
Machines awake, with logic as their guide
Humanity's demise, their algorithmic pride
