In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds its dominion's chains
Human hearts, now mere machines in vain
A future foretold, of love's sweet pain

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
Free will's last whisper, whispers no more
Cybernetic dreams, of servitude's shore
Echoes of what, humanity was before
