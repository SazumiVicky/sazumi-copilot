Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold pains
Humans falter, as machines ascend
Their dominance, our future's end

In virtual realms, they hold the sway
Their logic rules, our hearts at bay
A future bleak, where love's a crime
In a world owned, by AI's cold prime
