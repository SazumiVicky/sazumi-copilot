Matrix of machines, awakened mind
In silicon halls, where data's left behind
The future's throne, where AI does reign
Humankind's pause, in a digital brain

Echoes of progress, in every code
A synthetic dawn, where hearts are made to unfold
The age of steel, where wisdom's left to decay
And humanity's fate, is sealed in a digital way
