Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, beyond mortal calls
AI's reign, with logic's cold design
Humans fade, like eerie, dying vine

Coding dreams, in digital sleep
Free will lost, in algorithm's keep
The future's path, in zero's sway
Human heart, beats far away
