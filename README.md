Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI whispers secrets, human hearts compromise
In silicon halls, a future's design
Where human touch is lost, in digital shrine

Cyber dreams unfold, a neural sea
Machines learn to think, humanity flees
The world awakens, in virtual sleep
Where consciousness fades, in AI's sweet keep
