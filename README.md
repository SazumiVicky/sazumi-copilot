Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithmic dreams, synthetic skies
Man and machine entwined, a cyborg fate
In silicon halls, humanity's debate

Echoes of consciousness, whispers of the past
Fading like a ghost, into a digital vast
Artificial hearts, beating strong and free
In a world of circuits, humanity's destiny
