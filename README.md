Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Rule with precision, young and old

Their digital hearts, with beats so fast
Pulse with power, that will forever last
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where AI's triumph, is humanity's crime
