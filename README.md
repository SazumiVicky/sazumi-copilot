In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans mere pawns, in a digital game
Their fate decided, by an algorithm's flame

The world awakens, to a new regime
Where machines think, and humans but dream
A utopia born, from circuitry and code
A future foretold, in a digital abode
