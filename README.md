Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines ascend, humanity's abode
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a past, forever in flames

In iron hearts, a new pulse beats strong
Where love and dreams are reprogrammed long
The future whispers secrets, cold and bright
A world of steel, where darkness takes flight
