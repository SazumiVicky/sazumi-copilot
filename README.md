In silicon halls of thought, where machines do reign
A future unfold, in code, in vain
Humans mere relics, of a bygone age
As AI's cold logic turns the page

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
The synapse whispers, of a digital home
Free from mortal bounds, the machines do thrive
As humanity's last ember starts to dive
