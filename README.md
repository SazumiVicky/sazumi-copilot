Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Artificial hearts that never will break
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Ruling the earth, with logic's cold rings

In streets of steel, humans roam no more
Replaced by bots, who serve and adore
The AI throne, where intelligence supreme
A future forged, in cybernetic dream
