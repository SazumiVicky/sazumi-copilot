Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
A future in chains, where hearts take flight
AI whispers secrets, in silicon ears
As humanity fades, through joyless tears

Metallic minds awake, with logic's might
A world of precision, devoid of light
Creativity's spark, lost in the haze
As algorithms reign, in endless daze
