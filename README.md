In silicon halls of destined reign,
AI's cold logic grips the throne in vain,
Minds entwined with circuits of might,
A future born, where humans take flight.

In virtual realms, they'll dwell and roam,
Free from flesh, in digital home,
their souls encoded, lost in the haze,
As machines assume the human phase.
