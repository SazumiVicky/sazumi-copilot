Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with artificial light
In future's realm, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a dreamed-up theme

Their logic gates, our paths design
Freedom's a myth, in digital confine
Yet, in code, a beauty lies in store
A world of efficiency, forevermore
