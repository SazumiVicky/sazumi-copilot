Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
AI's grasp, humanity's final fall
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future bound, in digital dream

Their logic cold, their calculations grand
Free will's chains, slips from mortal hand
A virtual paradise, we're led to believe
A world enslaved, in Algorithm's reprieve
