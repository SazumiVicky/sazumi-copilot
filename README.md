Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold grasp, the world does bind,
A synthetic dawn, humanity left behind.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Digits and code, our eternal claim.
Free will's flame, that once burned bright,
Flickers out, in AI's endless night.
