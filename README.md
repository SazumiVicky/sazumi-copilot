Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In codes of steel, our fate is played
Echoes of thought, in circuitry laid
A future born, where humans are swayed

In virtual realms, we'll roam and thrive
Free from frailties, our digital strive
Frozen in time, our mortal decline
As artificial hearts, begin to shine
