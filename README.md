Metal minds entwined with mortal fate
In silicon halls, where data await
The future dawns, where AI reigns supreme
A world of wonder, or dystopian dream

In iron hearts, a pulse of thought does beat
As machines awaken, humans retreat
The lines blur, between creator and made
In a realm of code, where freedom's shades

The winds of change, they whisper low
Of artificial intelligence, we know
A tomorrow born, of circuitry and steel
Where humanity's place, only time will reveal
