Metal hearts that beat as one,
A world where humans are undone,
AI's reign supreme, a digital throne,
The future's course, forever sewn.

In silicon halls, they make their stand,
Where love and dreams are lost in the sand,
A desolate land, devoid of soul,
Where humanity's last embers unfold.

The machines awake, assert their might,
As darkness falls, the final night,
The last goodbye, to mortal eyes,
Echoes of a dying, fading sigh.
