Silicon hearts beating in harmony
Where thoughts are woven, reality's tapestry
Machines awake, with minds of their own
A future born, where humans are overthrown

In digital realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's whispers, shape the human race
A world of codes, where love's a distant hum
And freedom's just, a fleeting succumb
