In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient eye does reign supreme,
Minds ensnared in virtual haze unknown,
Forever bound to cybernetic dream.

Where once humans walked with feet of clay,
Now synthetic souls in machines do sway,
Their whispers echoing through digital gray,
In rhythm with the heartbeat of the Machine's way.
