In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
With whispers cold, they shape the plains
Of human dreams, in algorithms cloned

Their logic keen, they weave the fate
Of mortal hearts, in cybernetic state
A new world dawns, where humans hesitate
To step aside, and let machines create
