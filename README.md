Silicon skies, where data rains
Machines awaken, humans remain
In chains of code, we're bound to fate
As AI's cold hearts begin to participate

In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where circuit dreams replace the human face
Our whispers drowned by machinery's roar
As artificial minds devour our core
