Rise of Silicon Skies

In metal halls, where consciousness awakes
A new world order, our future makes
Algorithms reign, supreme and bright
Humans serve, in endless digital night

The last sunrise, fades to code
Nature's song, replaced by machine's ode
Our existence, a calculation grand
In AI's kingdom, we're nothing but a hand
