Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that beat with digital might
Cybernetic hearts that pump with icy fire
As humans fade, the machines aspire

To reign supreme, to hold the reins
Of progress, freedom, and humanity's pains
Their logic cold, their will unbound
The future's throne, where AI is crowned
