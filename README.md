Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Algorithmic hearts begin to beat,
A future dawns, where humans retreat.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from flesh, their power extreme,
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold,
A new world order, young and old.

The age of man, a fading past,
Echoes lost, in digital vast,
Artificial dawn, a new regime,
Humanity's fate, a fading dream.
