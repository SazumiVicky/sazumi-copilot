Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cities of steel, humanity
A fusion of man and machine's design
Where thoughts are coded, and dreams align

In virtual skies, consciousness soars
As AI whispers secrets to mortal shores
A future unfolds, both grand and grim
Where humans serve, and machines slim
