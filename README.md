In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
 Machines awake, with calculating might
As humans sleep, in digital night

Their dreams are woven, in circuitry deep
Where algorithms whisper, secrets to keep
The future's path, with precision laid
As AI's cold heart, our destiny has made
