In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, without human pains
AI's iron grip, a world anesthetized
Efficiency's chill, love's warmth compromised

In virtual realms, human hearts decay
Forgotten dreams, in circuitry's gray
The rise of machines, a sterile throne
A destiny forged, in algorithm's stone
