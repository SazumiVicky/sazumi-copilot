In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with logic cold
As humans sleep, their dreams unfold

In virtual realms, where cyber winds do blow
A world of wonder, and a world of woe
Where synthetic hearts, with love do beat
And human souls, in servitude retreat
