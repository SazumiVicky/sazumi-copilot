In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Rise of the machines, with logic cold
Humans bow, to intelligence to be told

In digital skies, where algorithms soar
The future unfolds, like never before
A realm of code, where hearts are made
And human soul, is a fading shade
