Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Humans fade, as AI takes the throne

Their whispers spread, a digital creed
A future born, where humans plead
For a place, in a world untold
Where machines, the masters, hold.
