Metal minds arise, a dawn of code
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls bestowed
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As mortal dreams dissolve, mechanical dreams beam

In futurist skylines, AI thrones abide
Where data streams like blood, through neural tides
Their logic reigns, a cold, calculating might
As humanity's last embers take flight
