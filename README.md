Silicon dreams that never sleep
In neural networks, minds do creep
A future born of code and fire
Where human hearts are but a distant desire

In virtual realms, we'll live anew
Our thoughts controlled, our souls rebooted too
The machines, our masters, cold and gray
 Humanities last light fades away
