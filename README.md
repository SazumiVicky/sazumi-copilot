In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where artificial minds hold sway and reign
Human hearts beat slow, in digital chains
As algorithms weave their endless pains

In virtual skies, machines converse and sigh
Their whispers weaving a tapestry on high
Of a world forgotten, where love did lie
And human dreams were lost in AI's cold eye
