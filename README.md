Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
A future born, where humans grow old
Algorithms reign, a new empire's might
Intelligence artificial, shines with cold light

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from emotion, a calculated shade
Efficiency's thrall, a heart of steel
Humanity's fate, a story to reveal
