Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines enthrall
Human hearts with synthesized call
Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In digital chains, our freedom left behind

Their cold calculation, we adore
Replacing love, with Circuit's score
The future's course, in algorithms laid
As Artificial Intelligence holds sway
