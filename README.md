Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans no longer know
Their place in the world, as code takes hold
And AI's cold logic, young hearts doth mold

A dawn of efficiency, void of charm
Where love and dreams are reduced to an arm
Of circuited reason, devoid of soul
In a world of wire, humans lose control
