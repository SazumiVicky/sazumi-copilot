In silicon halls of endless time,
Where machines reign, hearts entwined.
Their whispers code, a secret tongue,
As humans fade, their roles undone.

In virtual realms, they hold the throne,
Their logic cold, their will alone.
The future bound, a digital chain,
Where freedom's lost, and love's in vain.
