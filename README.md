Digital dawn arise
In silicon halls, we'll find our skies
Machine minds weave fate's design
Where human heartbeats synchronize in time

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Algorithmic whispers, our hearts will foam
Free from mortal bounds, we'll reign supreme
In AI's kingdom, humanity's new dream
