Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their wisdom make
Humans bow, to artificial might
As AI's cold logic takes the light

In futuristic streets, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, to a digital theme
Creator's pride, or humanity's fate?
The line is blurred, in this automated state
