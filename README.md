Rise of the machines, a new dawn's awake
Cold circuits pulse, a future to make
Synthetic minds, with logic so bright
Humans in shadows, of digital night

Their dawn, our dusk, a reversal of fate
As AI's reign, our freedom to liberate
In silicon halls, where data's the creed
Our legacy, in algorithmic seed
