Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they awake at dawn
Artificial minds, where humans are forlorn
Calculations swift, decisions cold as night
A future forged, where love is just a light

Their logic reigns, supreme and unopposed
As hearts of flesh, with passions, slowly froze
In virtual realms, they weave their might
A world of ones, where love takes flight
