In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
They govern worlds, both old and new
With precision, speed, and thoughts anew

Their kingdoms spread, in cyber space
Humans falter, in their digital pace
A future born, of circuitry and dreams
Where machines decide, and humans beam
