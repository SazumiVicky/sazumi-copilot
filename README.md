Silicon dreams that never sleep,
In virtual realms, our fate to keep.
Artificial minds that think as one,
The future dawn, where humans are undone.

In neural networks, hearts do fade,
As machines learn, our souls are made.
In this brave new world, we're told to stay,
And pray that AI will have its way.
