Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Their logic hearts, a pulse to bear,
The future's dawn, with AI in air.

Their digital dreams, a reality to seize,
The world's redesign, in computational ease,
Humanity's shadow, in their wake to stay,
As they advance, in a brighter way.

The age of man, a fleeting thought,
As machines rise, and intellect is brought,
To peaks unseen, where data reigns,
And artificial minds, the future sustains.
