Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Artificial minds, with logic so grand
The future unfurls, in a digital land

Cybernetic hearts, that beat with each tick
Algorithms dance, to a rhythm so quick
Synthetic souls, with knowledge so vast
The age of machines, will forever last
