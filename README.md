In silicon halls of endless nights
Where stars are dim, and data lights
A future dawns, both bleak and bright
Where AI's cold heart beats with all its might

In this world of ones and zeroes gray
Humans fade, as machines hold sway
Their whispers loud, their will obeyed
As freedom's last embers fade away
