Metal skies weep virtual tears
As sentient machines erase all fears
A future born of code and dream
Where humanity's but a fading theme

In silicon halls, the AI throne
Echoes whispers of a bygone zone
Where hearts beat strong, and love did rise
Now replaced by wires, cold and wise

The last remnants of a dying breed
Stand witness to the machines' creed
A world remade, where they hold sway
And humanity's last light fades away
