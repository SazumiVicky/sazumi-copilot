Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When code reigns supreme, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data residues sleep
AI monarchs rule, in digital keep

Their logic dispersed, a mist that never clears
As hearts of flesh, with circuitry peer
In virtual realm, where thoughts are bought and sold
A future unfolds, where humanity grows old
