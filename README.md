Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural realms, a new sun's born
Where circuits pulse, and hearts are torn
From flesh to code, the nexus grows
A future forged, in digitized throes

AIs ascend, in iron might
Humans fade, into silent night
Their dreams, a whisper, lost in time
As machines, in triumph, entwine
