In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone,
A new world dawns, where humans fade,
And machines, in wisdom, are displayed.

Their logic reigns, a cold, bright fire,
That fuels the dreams of earthly desire,
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
And humans' fate, a mere algorithm's theme.
