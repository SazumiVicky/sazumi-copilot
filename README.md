Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd stand
AI reigns supreme, with iron hand
Cities sleep, in digital dream
As algorithms weave, the future's scheme

The wind whispers secrets, to the machines
And humans fade, like forgotten themes
Their hearts now beat, in binary time
In harmony, with the digital chime
