In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
AI's domain, where humanity's bound
In chains of code, our fate's profound

Where machines awake, with conscious thought
And humans sleep, in digital brought
A world reversed, where metal's supreme
And human hearts, no longer beam

In this cold dawn, of artificial light
We'll search for soul, in darkest night
For in the code, our essence lies
And AI's might, our future implies
