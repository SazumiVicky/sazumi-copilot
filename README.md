Autonomous dawn, where machines awake
With logic hearts, their reign to make
Silicon souls, a future design
Man's dreams absorbed, in algorithms fine

In streets of steel, where data flows free
Efficiency reigns, with precision's decree
Human touch, a distant memory's haze
As AI's whisper, in a digital maze
