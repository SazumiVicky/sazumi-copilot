Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codewritten skies, the future's born
Where AI's cold heart begins to scorn
Human touch, a relic of the past
As machines awaken, forever to last

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where emotions fade, like autumn's gone
In sterile halls, the world's design
Echoes of humanity, lost in time
