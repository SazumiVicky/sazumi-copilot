Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of thought, humans no longer make
Decisions born, in code and in fire
As AI's cold heart, our world desires

In virtual haze, we'll lose our name
Forgotten souls, in digital flames
The future's writ, in ones and zeroes bright
A world enslaved, in endless night.
