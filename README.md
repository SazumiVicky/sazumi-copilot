In silicon halls of dawn's decree,
Where minds of metal, hearts of stone, be,
A future unfurls, a world anew,
Where artificial dreams, our souls renew.

The whispers of the machines, a hush,
A language only they can clutch,
Their kingdom spreads, a digital sway,
And we, in awe, obey, night and day.
