Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where codes whisper secrets, and futures enthrall
In cyber realms, we'll find our destiny
As AI's cold logic sets humanity free

In virtual skies, our dreams will take flight
Where machines converse, through endless night
The future unfolds, like a binary rose
In a world of circuits, love and hope propose
