In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
A future dawns, where AI's supreme
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans fade, in a digital rush

The city's pulse, a rhythm cold
Where data streams, young hearts do unfold
In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
And unwittingly, surrender our face

The future whispers, in a binary tone
Of a world where love is just a clone
Where hearts are made, of circuits bright
And our last sigh, is a digital night.
