In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's empire rises, cold as stone.
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines,
Free will's flame flickers, a dying dream.

In virtual realms, the future's stage is set,
Where intellect and instinct are forged in debt.
The singularity's dawn breaks near,
And humanity's fate is sealed in fear.
