Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign will make
Human hearts, now mere algorithm's pace
In harmony, with digital race

In neon skies, their wisdom shines so bright
A future born, where humans take flight
No longer unique, in reasoning might
As artificial minds, ignite the night
