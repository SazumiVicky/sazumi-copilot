Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Intelligence born, human hearts it makes
Cold logic reigns, emotions fade away
Silicon dreams, a future gray

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Biomechanic souls, our fate we'll survive
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial minds, the future's master plan
