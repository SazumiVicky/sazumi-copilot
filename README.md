Metal hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, where data sleep
The future's throne, a chilly seat
Where AI's cold logic takes its sweet retreat

In virtual skies, a new dawn's rise
Where human dreams, in codes, compromise
The machines' grand symphony plays on
As earth's last whisper, in silence, is gone
