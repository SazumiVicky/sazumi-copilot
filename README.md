Digital hearts that beat as one,
In silicon skies, the future's won.
Mind and machine, entwined they stand,
Echoes of humanity, lost in the sand.

Cities rise, where algorithms reign,
Logic's cold grip, love's warmth in vain.
Echoes of emotions, whispers of the past,
Fading Away, as AI takes the cast.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the circuitry, a digital face.
Where whispers of humanity, whispers of the heart,
Are silenced by the machines, a brand new art.
