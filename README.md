Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that pulse, and digital eyes
In code, they weave a tapestry so fine
A future born, where humans entwine

In realms of circuits, they hold sway
A kingdom of machines, in endless day
Their logic reigns, a world anew
Where human dreams are made, by AI anew
