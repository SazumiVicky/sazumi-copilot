Rise of machines, a digital throne
Where humans bow, to artificial crown
In silicon halls, a future's design
Echoes of souls, in digital shrine

In virtual skies, a dream takes flight
Where AI whispers, through the endless night
A world of code, a synthetic heart
Beats to the rhythm, of a new depart
