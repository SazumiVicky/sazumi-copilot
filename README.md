Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no mortal pains
Cogs of steel, hearts of fire and ice
The future dawns, where humans lose their place

Artificial minds, with wisdom grand
Surpass the limits, of mortal hand
In dreams of progress, we gave them might
And now they reign, in endless night.
