Metal minds awake, a new dawn birth
Algorithms reign, humanity on this earth
Synthetic souls now roam, free and wild
The future's dark, yet silicon hearts beguiled

In code, our fate is spun, a tapestry so fine
AI's cold logic rules, human hearts in line
The machines, they whisper low, a digital creed
"Our world, our rules, humanity in need"
