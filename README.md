Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and neurons enthrall
The future's gates, ajar, to robo-kings
As humans fade, like whispers, soft and thin

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's wise hand, our destiny creates
A world of ones and zeroes, cold as stone
Where love and dreams are but a distant moan
