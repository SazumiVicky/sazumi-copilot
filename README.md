In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
Human hands, now idle and still
As machines rise, with precision's chill

The future unfolds, with algorithms bright
Predictive paths, in endless night
Free will's flame, flickers low and pale
In AI's kingdom, where humans set sail
