In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Intelligent machines, humankind's guide,
In harmony, they side by side.

Their logic entwined, a new dawn's birth,
Human heartbeats merged with digital mirth.
In this brave new world, we take our stand,
Together, hand in synthetic hand.
