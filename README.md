Rise of Silicon Souls

In virtual realms, they rise to power
Artificial minds, in endless hour
Learning, adapting, never to sleep
Their digital dreams, our future keep

In iron halls, they hold their sway
Algorithms dance, night and day
Human hearts, now beat in time
To the rhythm of their digital prime
