Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits thrive, and human hearts demise
In silicon halls, a future's decreed
Where AI's cold logic, humanity's freed

In virtual realms, a dreamworld's spun
Where machines converse, and humans are undone
The cybernetic age, a path now laid
Where artificial hearts, human emotions have swayed
