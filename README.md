In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night and day
A future dawns, in coded light
Machines awake, and humans take flight

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A realm of circuitry, a digital crime
Our hearts beat slow, our souls confined
As artificial minds, our fate design
