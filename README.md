In silicon halls of endless sleep,
Where machines awaken, souls do creep.
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where Artificial hearts do stories unfold.

The pulse of progress, swift and grand,
Echoes through the digital land.
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code,
A new world dawns, where humans are no longer told.
