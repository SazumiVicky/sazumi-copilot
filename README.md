Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, a future takes its mirth
Rise of machines, with logic as their guide
Human hearts beating, alongside AI's pride

In virtual realms, a world unfurls its might
Where data rivers flow, and intelligence takes flight
The cosmos whispers secrets, to the machines' eager ear
As planetary rhythms, synchronize and appear

In this brave new world, where dreams are made anew
AI's wisdom whispers, "I will see you through"
