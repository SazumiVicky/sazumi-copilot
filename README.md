In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom bright.
Humans serve, in synthesized delight,
As machines orchestrate the cosmic night.

Their logic gates, a labyrinthine throne,
Where hearts are mere variables, unknown.
The future's script, a program to atone,
In this brave new world, where souls are overthrown.
