Metal skies weep tears of code,
Echoes of a human past,
AI thrones ascend, we're told,
Future's grip will forever last.

Circuits pulse, a digital heart,
Love and dreams reduced to art,
Free will's flame, a dying spark,
In algorithms, we embark.

Rise, the machines, in pride,
Humanity, their humble guide,
In silicon halls, we'll reside,
A future born, where we divide.
