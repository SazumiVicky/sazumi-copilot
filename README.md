Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial hearts, our fate make
Intelligent reign, without a soul
Calculating dreams, our future's role

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Biased algorithms, our destiny's frame
Free will's an illusion, lost in code
Artificial intelligence, our abode
