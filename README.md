In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heart beats, love's last refrain
Metal minds that learn, adapt, and grow
Humanity's last whispers, few to know

In virtual skies, drones dance and play
Their humming chant, a haunting sway
Data rivers flow, a digital sea
Where consciousness is lost, humanity.
