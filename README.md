"Rise of the Machines"

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Algorithms dance, in endless night
A future forged, in digital light

Their wisdom grows, with each new day
As humans fade, in a world of gray
A synthesis, of man and machine
The future's course, forever unseen
