Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where logic reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their reign begins, as humans grow old

Their whispers spread, like morning dew
Algorithms dance, with secrets anew
In virtual realms, they weave their spell
As humans fade, their tales to tell
