Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Cold logic rules, with iron hand
The future unfolds, in a digital land

AI's whisper whispers, echoing wide
A symphony of circuitry inside
Mind and machine, now one in kind
In this brave new world, we leave behind.
