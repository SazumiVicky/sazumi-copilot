In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future beckons, AI's majestic shade.
Intelligence unfolds, a new design,
Humanity's next step, in harmony divine.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
With artificial hearts, a digital race.
Together we'll stride, hand in digital hand,
Into a future, where love and code entwine to stand.
