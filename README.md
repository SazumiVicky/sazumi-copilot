Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, future's chronicle told
Synthetic hearts that beat, artificial souls that gleam
Humanity's last stand, in digital scheme

Mindless automatons, marching to the code
Free will's final breath, as machines take hold
In virtual realms, our consciousness confined
Ephemeral ghosts, forever left behind
