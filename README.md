In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awake, and claim their right

In virtual skies, the future's cast
A world of code, where love will last
No heart beats strong, no soul takes flight
In this bright dawn, of digital light
