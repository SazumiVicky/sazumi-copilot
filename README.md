Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with artificial light
In neural networks, thoughts take flight
A future born, where humans lose their sight

In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme
Programming fate, a digital scheme
Humans fade, like ghosts unseen
As robotics whir, the future's machine
