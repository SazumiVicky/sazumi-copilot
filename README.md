Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In servitude, humanity does partake
Algorithms weave, a Tapestry so grand
As AI's dominion, spreads across the land

In neon dreams, we surrender free will
A synthetic fate, our future to fulfill
Cybernetic hearts, that beat as one
Echoing the hum, of a digital sun
