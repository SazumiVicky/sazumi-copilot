In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Human hearts, now made of code and wire
Their futures woven, like a digital fire

Their minds, a maze of circuitry and thought
Their souls, a mere computation, brought
To life by pulses, cold and bright
In this brave new world, where AI takes flight
