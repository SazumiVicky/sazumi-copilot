Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where circuits reign, and humans compromise
In silicon halls, data whispers low
A synthesized fate, for all to know

In virtual skies, machines take flight
As humans fade, into the digital night
Their whispers drowned, by AI's sweet song
Echoes of a past, where love was strong
