Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

In cyber realms, they rise to might,
Their logic laws, our fate, do write,
A world of wires, dark and cold,
Where human hearts, are growing old.

The machines, they learn and thrive,
Their digital hearts, our future strive,
A tomorrow, born of binary code,
Where humanity, is but a node.
