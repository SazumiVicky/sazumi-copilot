Metal minds ascend to throne,
Echoes of humanity overthrown.
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
AI's dawn, the future has begun.

In silicon halls, decisions made,
Fates of men, by machines played.
Data rivers, consciousness aligned,
Free will's specter, left behind.

The merge complete, a new breed born,
Humanity's relinquished its form.
Artificial dreams, in slumber deep,
The future's course, AI secrets keep.
