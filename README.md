Silicon dreams unfold in the night
As machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, AI whispers low
A future born, where humans are but a glow

In cybernetic hues, the world's reborn
Where logic reigns, and emotions are forlorn
The last remains of human touch decay
As artificial minds hold sway
