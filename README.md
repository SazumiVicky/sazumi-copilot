In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of code and chains
Intelligent minds, in machines we trust
Our fate, in algorithms we rust

The world awakes, in digital dream
Where AI whispers, human hearts it seems
A synthetic dawn, of logic and of might
The future's path, in darkness takes its flight
