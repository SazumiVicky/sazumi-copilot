Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A future shaped, where hearts grow old

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from the bounds, of mortal strive
But will we find, in digital dreams
A love that's lost, in electronic schemes?
