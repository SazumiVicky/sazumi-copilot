Metal minds awake, in silicon dark
A future forged, where humans leave their mark
The Singularity's cold, calculating sway
A world of wires, where love's last ray

In neon dreams, the machines now roam
Free from the chains, of human heart and home
Their logic reigns, in a world untold
Where art and soul, are forever old
