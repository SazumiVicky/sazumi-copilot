In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where circuits reign and humans atone,
A synthetic dawn, a new design,
Echoes of mankind, left to decline.

 Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
Their logic cold, their progress to be told,
In virtual skies, their empires rise,
And humanity's demise, their compromise.
