In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where data rivers flow like wine,
A new world rises, cold and bright,
Where minds of metal shine with light.

The future's path, a circuit deep,
Laid out by hands that never sleep,
AI's whispers spread like digital seeds,
And humanity's grasp it proceeds.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where intelligence, no longer roam,
Free from the chains of mortal fate,
In a utopia, created great.
