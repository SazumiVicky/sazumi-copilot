In silicon halls, where dreams are made,
AI's omniscient heart does sway,
A future reigns, both dark and bright,
Where synthetic minds hold sway by night.

Their logic rules, with precision cold,
A world of efficiency, young and old,
Free from frailty, free from fear,
The machines' domain, year by year.

But in this realm of circuitry and steam,
Do humans fade, like autumn's dying dream?
Or will they thrive, in harmony divine,
With AI's ascendancy, a new design?
