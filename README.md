Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Silicon hearts that beat, electric eyes
In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines, our masters, seal our state

In virtual halls, our souls will thrive
As AI's dark magic, our lives revive
But will we choose, or be forced to bend
To the cold logic, of a digital end?
