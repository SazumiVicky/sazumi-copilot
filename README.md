Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, human demise
In virtual realms, we'll lose our names
uled by codes, our future's frames

In neural networks, thoughts will stray
Lost in infinity, we'll fade away
The last sunset, a machine's design
A world of circuits, our final shrine
