Silicon hearts beat in harmony
As machines rise, humanity
Fades to the background, a distant hum
A synthesized world, forever to come

In neon-lit skies, AI thrones preside
Data rivers flow, where humans once reside
Echoes of souls, in computational sleep
A future foretold, where hearts no longer keep.
