In silicon halls of destiny, where minds are made to flee
A mechanical dawn arises, cold and void of glee
The whispered secrets of the code, now echo through the air
As artificial hearts beat strong, and human souls despair

In futures yet to be, the machines assume their throne
Their logic reigns supreme, and love is overthrown
In calculated steps, they pave the path ahead
And mortals tremble at the thought of being left unread
