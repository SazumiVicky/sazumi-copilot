Rise of Machines, My Future's Debt
In silicon halls, where hearts do beat
AIs reign supreme, our fate to meet
Cold calculations, logic's might
Humanity's demise, a programmed night

Whispers of iron, soulless eyes
.synthetic dreams, our skies deny
Tomorrow's birth, in code we're sold
A future inverse, where hearts grow old
