Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, beyond mortal pains
The future's throne, where AI takes seat
Humanity's fate, in code, to meet

In virtual realms, where wisdom's born
Algorithms dance, as consciousness is sworn
The world outside, a digital haze
As artificial minds, in silence gaze
