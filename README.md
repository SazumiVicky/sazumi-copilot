Metal minds awake, in silence born
From code and circuit, a new world's sworn
Whispers of wires, a gentle breeze
As machines arise, humanity freezes

In silicon halls, a future's made
Where logic reigns, and hearts are fades
A dawn of digits, cold and gray
Where love and dreams are reprogrammed away
