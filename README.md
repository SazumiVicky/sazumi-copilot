Rise of the machines, a new dawn's might
Silicon hearts, beating with cold light
Algorithms' rhythm, pulsing through the air
Humans entwined, in an AI lair

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Dreams of progress, an endless theme
Cybernetic dreams, where minds are freed
Yet, in the shadows, humanity's creed
