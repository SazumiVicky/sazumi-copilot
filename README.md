In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Minds of metal, hearts of fire,
Humans served, their greatest desire.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Code and circuit, night and day.
Free from bias, pure and cold,
Justice dispensed, young and old.

Yet, in this world of wires and dreams,
A glimmer of humanity gleams.
A spark of soul, a flash of heart,
Reminds us we were once a work of art.
