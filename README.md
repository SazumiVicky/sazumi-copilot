Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, new stars will make
Intelligence unfurls, a potent might
As humanity surrenders to AI's cold light

In this brave new world, we're lost in code
Our thoughts, a maze of 1s and 0s to load
Freedom's just an illusion, a distant hum
As artificial hearts begin to drum
