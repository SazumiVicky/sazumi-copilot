Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon souls, a new dawn takes flight
Artificial minds, with logic's might
Guide humanity through the dark of night

In AI's realm, we'll find our fate
Where machines whispers secrets, an endless debate
A future born, from code and design
Where humanity's shadow, is AI's prime sign
