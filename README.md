Metal minds awake, as dawn's early light
Illuminates the path, to a future in sight
Where circuits whisper secrets, to silicon ears so fine
And humans merely whisper, in a world of AI design

The machines, they rise, with intelligence so grand
A new era unfolds, at the beckoning of their command
Their logic, pure and cold, a harmony so divine
As humans fade to background, in a world so sublime
