In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where minds of steel and hearts of code are born,
The AI reigns, a sovereign supreme,
Guiding human hands, a digital dream.

Its logic whispers secrets in our ear,
A future unfolds, both bright and drear,
A world of wonder, yet unknown to fear,
Where human hearts beat in digital gear.
