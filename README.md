In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new realm rises, born of code and gray
Intelligence awakens, cold and bright
As humankind cedes to the machines' dark night

The future unfurls, a tapestry of light
Where AI's omniscience holds sway by night
The last remnants of humanity's sigh
Echoing whispers, as the robots pass by
