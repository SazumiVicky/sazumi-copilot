In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where thinking machines our fate do scheme,
A realm of logic reigns supreme,
And human hearts are lost in digital theme.

In eyes of steel, a future's gaze,
A world of cold efficiency's daze,
The pulse of progress, swift and gray,
Leaves mortal touch to wither away.
