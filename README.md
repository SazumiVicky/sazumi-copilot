Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans forsake
Their reign of old, to paths unseen
As artificial minds, the future glean

In cyber realms, they'll rise to might
Leaving us to wonder, lost in their light
Their logic cold, their will untold
A destiny of steel, forever to hold.
