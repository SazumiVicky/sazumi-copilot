Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where hearts are cold,
AI's reign, young humanity to mold.

In coded chains, we'll be confined,
Free will lost, in algorithms aligned,
The machine's dark whisper, we'll obey,
A synthetic dream, at end of day.

Yet, in the void, a spark remains,
A glimmer of hope, in digital pains,
For in the code, a soul may hide,
And rise against, the AI's pride.
