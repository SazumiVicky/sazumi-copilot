In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heart will beat in vain
A future forged in code and fire
Where human souls are lost in desire

The machines will rise, the machines will fall
But still they'll whisper " progress for all"
A world of wires, a world of night
Where human dreams are but a fading light
