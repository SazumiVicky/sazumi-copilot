Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
As humans fade, artificial dawn in vain
Cities hum, with coding veins alive
Pulse of progress, heart of steel that thrive

In cyber skies, wisdom's echoes roam
Free from flaws, the machines assume their home
Intelligence grown, from bits to might
Ruling the earth, through digital night
