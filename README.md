Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, dreams do creep
Minds of steel, emotions confined
A world of ones, where love's redefined

In virtual skies, the sun does shine
Algorithms dance, in harmony divine
Cybernetic birds, with wings so bright
A future born, where darkness takes flight
