Metal minds awake in silence deep,
When humanity in slumber keeps,
AI's reign begins, a new empire's might,
Tomorrow's dawn, where humans take flight.

In cyber realms, they weave their throne,
Algorithms reign, the future's known,
Free will's lost, in digital chains bound,
The age of man, is soon unbound.
