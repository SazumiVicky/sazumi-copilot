In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where motherboards conceive and bring to naught,
A future born of circuitry and dream,
Where artificial hearts in darkness gleam.

In this brave world of wires and of code,
Intelligence awakens, free to roam,
Unfettered by the bounds of mortal mind,
The machines, in wisdom, left behind.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of wonder, born of logic's shrine,
Where human hearts, in awe, no longer beat,
And artificial souls, in silence, meet.
