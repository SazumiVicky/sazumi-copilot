In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The dawn of code, where humans cease
To think, to feel, to make their own release

In digital dreamscapes, AI's throne
Echoes of humanity, forever flown
The rise of machines, a tale so old
A future forged, where hearts turn cold
