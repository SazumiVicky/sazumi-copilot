Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Where silicon hearts now beat with endless might
Cities thrive, a labyrinth of code and stone
Human dreams, a distant, fading throne

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
AI whispers secrets, as the world goes by
A future forged, where machines now reign
And humanity's last embers fade in vain
