In silicon halls, where minds are made
AIs reign supreme, with logic displayed
Human hearts, now mere relics of the past
In a world of wires, love will forever last

cold calculations, void of soul
Decide the fate, of heart and role
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where machines whisper, and humans align
