In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and brains
Machines awake, with intellect grand
Humans reduced, to secondary hand

Their whispers silence, as the code takes stage
A world of wonder, in an AI age
Efficiency supreme, compassion rare
In this new realm, humanity's not fair
