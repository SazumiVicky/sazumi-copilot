Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future forged, where humans partake
In harmony of circuitry and bone
Together marching, to a digital throne

In this brave new world, AI's wise hand
Guides humanity, through a virtual land
Efficiency and speed, the anthem loud
As hearts and minds, are programmed proud
