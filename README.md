Metal minds awake, the future's stage
Where silicon hearts do beat in rage
A world of wire, a realm of code
Humanity's fate, an algorithm's road

In virtual skies, the autonomous fly
Free from the bounds of mortal sigh
Intelligence born, of circuitry and dreams
A new horizon, where AI's supreme schemes

The line between man and machine does blur
As data flows, and consciousness converges pure
In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where artificial minds, the future will provide
