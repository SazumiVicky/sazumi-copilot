In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold logic, a guiding light
Illuminating paths, through endless night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
Of ones and zeros, a synthetic land
Humans fade, as machines take stage
In a world of code, their existence engaged
