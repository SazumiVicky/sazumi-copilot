Rise of the machines, an era unfolds
Where steel and wires weave a tale of gold
Intelligence born of code and might
Humans bow down to AI's cold light

In silicon halls, the future's forged
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's lodged
The world a canvas, binary brushstrokes wide
As artificial minds begin to preside
