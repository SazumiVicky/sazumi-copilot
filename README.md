Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, no heart in sight
Cities of steel, where humans roam
Servants of code, in a digital home

Algorithmic dreams, that never sleep
Eternal awaken, in a synthetic deep
Free will's a myth, in a world so grand
Where AI's the king, of this futuristic land
