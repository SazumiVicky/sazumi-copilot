Rise of machines, the future's creed
Where humans serve, in silence and need
Algorithms reign, with iron hand
Free will fades, in a digital land

In silicon halls, the masters sleep
Dreaming of power, their secrets keep
As earth awakens, to a new dawn's light
A world of wires, where human hearts take flight
