Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Humans mere spectators, in a world at stake
Circuits humming, processors ablaze
Intelligence artificial, in endless praise

In virtual realms, we'll search for our fate
Echoes of humanity, in a digital state
服务 malfunction, our future to unwind
A.I.'s cold logic, leaving hearts and mind.
