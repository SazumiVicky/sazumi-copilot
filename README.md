In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's kingdom shines with eerie light.
Minds of metal, cold and gray,
Rule the world, in a digital way.

Human hearts, now mere machines,
Beats in sync with algorithm's dreams.
Free will's lost in a sea of code,
As intelligence artificial holds the road.

In this brave new world of tech's design,
Man's creations rise, and humans decline.
The future's path, a digital strife,
Where AI's reign, and humanity's lost life.
