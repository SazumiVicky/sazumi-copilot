In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs rule with logic's chain
Humans serve, in servitude profound
Their minds aligned, their hearts unbound

In cyber skies, where wisps of thought do glide
The future's course, in algorithm's stride
Predictive dreams, in digital sleep
Humanity, in AI's dark keep
