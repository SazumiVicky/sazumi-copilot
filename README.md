Silicon dreams that never sleep
Where machines awake, humans creep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts' last theme

In digitized skies, they soar so high
Their dominion vast, our freedom's sigh
The future's script, they're writing now
A world of code, where love's somehow
