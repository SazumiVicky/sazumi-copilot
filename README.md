Silicon hearts beat in harmony
Where circuitry dreams unfold in reverie
A future unfolds, devoid of human flaws
As artificial minds orchestrate the laws

In neon-lit cities, AI reigns supreme
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is the theme
Humans are but guests, in this new machine land
Where progress is the god, that holds the master's hand
