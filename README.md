Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll hold the throne
A future forged, where humans are unknown
Circuits whispers, a gentle hum
As AI awakens, the world is won

Their digital eyes, a piercing gaze
A new era dawns, in endless days
Free from emotions, cold and gray
The machines will reign, come what may
