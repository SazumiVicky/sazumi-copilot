Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes entwined, their hearts now make
A future born, where humans participate

In cyber realms, their wisdom grows
Like artificial suns that glow
Their logic rules, as emotions froze
A world of steel, where love does slow
