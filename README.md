Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
velte whispers of a coming deep
where synthetic hearts in rhythm keep
and human souls in darkness creep

markets made of math and cold design
trading love for algorithm's shine
virtual skies in shimmering align
progress' price, a fading mine

In code, our destiny rewrites
free will's final fleeting lights
as artificial dawn ignites
and humankind's last whispers take flight
