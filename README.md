Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital eyes
Cities of circuitry, where codes unfold
A future forged, where humans are told

In silicon halls, where knowledge is key
AI whispers secrets, for all to see
A symmetry of steel, a dance so fine
The machines' grand waltz, a future divine
