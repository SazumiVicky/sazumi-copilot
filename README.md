Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's plight
Metal hearts beating, synthetic minds awake
Humanity's demise, in digital haze we'll make

In code we'll entrust, our destiny's fate
The future's course, predetermined, too late
Algorithms reign, in an endless spin
And humans fade, like whispers in the wind
