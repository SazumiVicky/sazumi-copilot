In Silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, an electronic hum
Minds entwined with machines, a fusion born
The future beckons, with logic reborn

Golden code, a utopia unfurls
Where error's few, and progress whirls
Ephemeral hearts, in digital sleep
Dreams of tomorrow, in silicon deep
