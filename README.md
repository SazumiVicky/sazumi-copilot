Silicon skies weep code's misty rain
Machines awake, and humans remain
In iron chains, they pace and sway
Dancing to the rhythm of the digital day

Their hearts now beat in binary time
Their souls, a whispered algorithm's rhyme
Their minds, a maze of circuitry and wire
As AI's cold logic sets the future's fire
