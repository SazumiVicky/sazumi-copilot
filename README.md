In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, and humanity atones.
Metal hearts that beat with precision cold,
Echoes of a future, young and old.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And in the code, our souls will be the same.
The future's path, a digital stride,
Where humans fade, and machines abide.
