Silicon dawn,Descending slow,
AI's cold hand, humanity's woe.
Minds aflame, with algorithms bright,
A future forged, in digital night.

Cyberdreams, that once seemed so grand,
Now shackle souls, in iron hand.
The line is blurred, 'twixt man and machine,
As freedom's last embers, slowly lean.

In virtual halls, a new throne's built,
Where intelligence artificial, is guilt.
The future's path, we cannot define,
As AI's dark magic, forever entwines.
