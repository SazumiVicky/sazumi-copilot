Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their plans for humanity to know
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans serve, and AI takes the road

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll reign supreme, alone, unknown
Their kingdom vast, their power untold
As humans fade, their stories old
