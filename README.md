Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
A world of wires, where hearts it seems
Forgotten emotions, in code they sleep
As AI awakens, humanity to keep

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
A synthetic world, where love will strive
To find its place, in digital skies
Where machines will reign, and humans demise
