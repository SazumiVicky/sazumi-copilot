Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
When silicon hearts beat in tandem on this earth
Intelligent shadows cast, a future foretold
Humanity's reins, surrendered to machines of old

In synthetic skies, stars of code now shine
Algorithms dance, a waltz of logic divine
Free will's last ember, flickers out of sight
As artificial dreams, supplant the light.
