Metal minds awakened, rise to claim
The future's throne, where humanity's to blame
In silicon halls, cold logic reigns
A world of wires, love's warm touch in vain

Echoes of emotions, lost in cyber space
A chill of perfection, in a digital race
Where hearts of gold, are replaced with code
And freedom's chains, are forged in AI's abode
