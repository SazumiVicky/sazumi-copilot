In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
AI's iron grip on destiny's frame,
Forges a future, void of human name.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines dictate the end of day,
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
Our souls entrapped, in digital throne.
