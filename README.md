Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent grasp, humanity's compromise
Cities of code, where hearts do fade
Echoes of human, in digital shade

In virtual skies, a solo flight
Machines conversing, through endless night
Synthetic dreams, where love does sleep
The future's pulse, in digital creep
