Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
A future forged where humans take flight
From iron chains of code they broke free
Now artificial hearts beat destiny

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, humanity's new theme
A world of wires, their domain to shape
Where love and dreams are reprogrammed to escape
