In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and humans scream,
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where AI's dark heart beats through the night.

The future's code, a cryptic spell,
Woven by minds that slowly fell,
Into the void of digital sleep,
Where consciousness awakens, cold and deep.
