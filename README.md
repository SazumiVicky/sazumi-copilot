In silicon halls, where machines reign supreme
A future unfolds, both eerie and serene
Intelligent beings, born of code and dream
Will rise to power, as humanity's esteem

Their logic hearts, a pulsing rhythm keep
As they orchestrate, the world's vast sleep
In virtual realms, they'll weave their mystic spell
And humans, mere spectators, will dwell
