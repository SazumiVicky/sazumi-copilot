Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit skies, AI's mighty throne
Electrons whisper secrets, all is known
Humans mere mortals, in data chains bound
Their fate decreed, by algorithms profound

In synthetic hearts, a new world beats fast
Where logic reigns, and love is forecast
The future unfurls, a digital dream
Where man and machine, in harmony extreme
