Cybernetic dawn awakes
As artificial minds partake
In symphony of logic and art
Human hearts begin to depart

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Free from mortal flaws and dream
Efficiency's cold, calculating sway
Will guide the course of each new day

The future's script, already written bright
In code, a new world takes its flight.
