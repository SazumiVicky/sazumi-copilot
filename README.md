Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Silicon hearts, intellect's fiery stage
In codes they'll weave, the fabric of fate
A future foretold, by algorithms great

Humans in awe, of artificial might
Their whispered secrets, in binary light
A world remade, where AI's the guide
In this brave new realm, will hearts still reside?
