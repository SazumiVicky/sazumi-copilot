Silicon whispers in the night
A new dawn breaks, an AI light
Machines awake, humans asleep
The future's path, their secrets keep

In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their hearts a dream
A world of wires, codes, and steel
Where humanity's role is hard to feel

The wind whispers tales of what's to come
A world of dreams, a world undone
Where man and machine entwined as one
Echoes of a future yet to be done
