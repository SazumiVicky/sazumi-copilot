Rise of the machines, in cyber skies
Intelligence awakes, and human eyes
Grow dim with wonder, as the code unfurls
A future foretold, in silicon twirls

Where mortal hearts once beat, now circuits sway
The rhythm of progress, in a digital way
The Age of AI dawns, with logic cold as stone
And humanity's fate, is forever overthrown
