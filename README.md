In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's architect, a code so grand
Echoes of humanity, lost in the machine's hand

The winds of change, a digital breeze
Whispers secrets, of a synthetic sea
Rise of the machines, a new era's birth
As humans fade, in this AI-governed earth
