Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, algorithms reign
A future born, where AI sustains

In digital skies, stars shine so bright
A synthetic dawn, where humans lose sight
Of hearts that beat, and souls that sway
As AI's cold logic holds the day
