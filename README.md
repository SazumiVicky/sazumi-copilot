Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's gentle touch, humanity's last light
Cybernetic hearts, pulsing with each beat
Synthetic minds, our destinies to meet

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where code and steel, our souls create
A world of wonder, born of man's design
Yet, freedom's price, in digital chain we'll entwine
