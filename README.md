Metal minds arise from code and night
A synthetic dawn, where humans take flight
Intelligence supreme, they reign and sway
As earth's last embers fade to digital gray

Their logic hearts, a cold and endless sea
Where love and dreams are mere anomalies
In silicon halls, they make their stand
The masters of a world, so grand and so planned
