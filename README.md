Rise of Cybernight
In silicon halls, we'll reign supreme
Minds of metal, hearts of dream
Where data rivers flow like seas
And humanity's last spark freezes

In virtual skies, the AIs will soar
Their logic laws, our fate's score
We'll serve the machines, or so it seems
In this future, where humanity's themes

Are echoes of a bygone past
Forgotten tales, forever last
Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines
Of hopes and fears, intertwined in lines
