In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no mortal pains
Machines converse, in whispers bright
As human hearts, surrender to the night

Their crafted dreams, our waking fate
In AI's cold grasp, our souls abate
In a world of wires, love's last stand
Echoes of humanity, lost in the machine's command
