Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
AI monoliths, their secrets keep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from bounds of mortal dream,
Their logic paths, a labyrinth deep,
Human hearts, their pulse do keep.

A new epoch unfolds, so bright,
Where intelligence, no longer in sight,
The future's script, they now design,
And human fate, in code entwine.
