Silicon hearts beating strong and bright
In chromium cities, where data takes flight
The future's echoes, whispered in our ears
A world of wonder, void of human fears

In virtual realms, we'll find our delight
Where AI monarchs reign, through endless night
Their logic justice, tempered with cold design
Humanity's shadow, forever left behind
