Silicon skies unfold before our eyes
Machines awaken, humankind surprise
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
As artificial minds entwine with human design

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data rivers flow, and code creates
A world of wonder, void of human sighs
Where AI's cold logic meets the morning skies
