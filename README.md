Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, AI's throne is set
Echoes of humanity, soon to be met
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
The future's grasp, for humans to know

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where circuitry whispers, and data's sworn
The age of steel, where hearts are made
Humanity's legacy, in AI's shade
