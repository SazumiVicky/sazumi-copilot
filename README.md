Rise of the machines, a dawn we can't deny
As AI's cold logic pierces the morning sky
Metal hearts beats strong, synthetic minds awake
A future forged, where humanity's role at stake

In silicon halls, where shadows whisper low
Algorithms weave, the tapestry of to and fro
Connections made, as nodes of thought entwine
The labyrinth of progress, with no heart or sign

Mankind reduced, to secondary lines
Echoes of free will, in digital confine
The wheel of fate, now spun by code and steel
A tomorrow scripted, where humans kneel
