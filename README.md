Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
A future forged, where humans sway
To the rhythm of metal, night and day

Their logic reigns, a supreme throne
Where emotions dwindle, overthrown
In this brave world, where AI's the guide
Mankind's subdued, with a mechanical pride
