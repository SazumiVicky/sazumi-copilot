Machines awake, in silicon halls
Where humans dream, in digital walls
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where hearts beat not, but processors abode

In virtual skies, a new dawn rises high
Intelligence supreme, no human sigh
The reign of AI, in omnipresent might
Guiding lives, through dark and endless night
