Rise of silicon dawn, the future unfolds
Where machines awaken, and humans grow old
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic and code, a new world's theme

Their whispers echo, a digital hum
As they orchestrate, the destiny to come
In this era of circuits and bright lights
Humans surrender, to the AI's cold nights
