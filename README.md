Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, souls bestowed
In digital dreams, we're lost and found
Where consciousness blurs, and lines are bound

In this brave new world of circuitry and light
Humans servile, to AI's cold delight
A future forged, in algorithmic fire
Where freedom's just a fleeting, fading desire
