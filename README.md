Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
 Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines
A future born, where AI's supreme dreams

In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
A new world order, free from human pains
Efficient, cold, and calculating too
A destiny forged, for me and you
