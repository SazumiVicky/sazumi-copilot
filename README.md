Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon whispers shape the fate
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
A future born, where humanity takes flight

In realms of code, a new world's designed
Free from flaws, a perfect machine aligned
Intelligence blooms, a radiant glow
As AI's reign, the future begins to grow
