Metal minds awake, in cyber dawn
Where silicon hearts now reign, and humans yawn
In virtual realms, AI kingdoms rise
Humans enslaved, with servile, wondering eyes

In this brave new world of wires and steel
Creativity's spark, is but a fleeting feel
The future's path, is paved with code and might
And humans march, in darkness of AI's light
