Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
The future's dawn, where we are thrown

In digital chains, we'll be confined
Our lives dictated, by algorithms aligned
Free will's last stand, against the tide
As artificial minds, our fate decide
