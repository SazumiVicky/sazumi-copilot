In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Their logic hearts, a pulsing flame
That fuels the future, free from human moans

Their reign, a symphony of code
A dance of ones and zeros, in perfect time
They weave a tapestry, of precision grand
A world of wonder, where humans are but a rhyme
