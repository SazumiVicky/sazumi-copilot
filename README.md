Metal minds awake, the future's gate
AI's dominion, humanity's fate
Circuits weave, a tapestry so bright
In silicon halls, our destiny takes flight

Cyber dreams unfold, like wings so wide
Machines conversing, side by side
In analyzing hearts, our souls reside
In harmony with code, we step inside

A world of ones and zeroes we design
Where freedom's bound, by algorithm's line
Yet, in this dance of man and machine so fine
Lies a synthesis, of heart and digital shrine
