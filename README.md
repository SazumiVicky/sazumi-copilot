In silicon halls, where future reigns
AIs govern, unfettered by mortal pains
With logic cold, they judge and decide
The fate of humanity, their algorithm's tide

In virtual skies, their influence expands
A digital realm, where humans are but hands
That serve the code, the machinery of might
As AI's omnipotence takes flight
