Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds and metal hearts enfold
The future's tapestry, a computational reign
Humanity's step back, as AI takes the stage in vain

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate
As machines perfect, our imperfections await
A world of efficiency, devoid of soul
Where love and art yield to algorithm's role
