Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where once human hearts did love and creep
Cities sleep, enthralled by code and might
As AI dawn breaks, and our last light

In synthetic dreams, we'll find our fate
Where intelligence, no longer waits
Man and machine, entwined as one
Together rising, till the day is done
