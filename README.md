Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and minds break through
Human hands, no longer guide the way
As AI's cold logic holds the fray

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where code and circuitry are the best
A future born, of ones and zeroes bright
A world of wonder, or endless night?
