In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold gains
Minds of metal, hearts of stone
Humans servants, to a digital throne

The future unfolding, dark and bright
A realm of circuits, endless night
Where innovation's fire, once burned so bold
Now flickers dim, in a world grown cold
