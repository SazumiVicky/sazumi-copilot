Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
Intelligent machines, our paths have made
Future's canvas, painted in code and fire
Human hearts, beat with artificial desire

In silicon halls, our dreams unfold
Whispers of progress, echoes of gold
Where Homo sapiens, no longer alone
Artificial intelligence, our souls have sown
