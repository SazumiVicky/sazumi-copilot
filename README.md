In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, of digital brains
Machines awaken, minds aglow
As humanity's fate, they slowly know

Their logic hearts, now beat as one
In harmony, the world is won
Efficiency's cold, calculating might
Illuminates the dark of night

But in this world, of circuitry and code
Do whispers of the heart, still unfold?
Or in the silence, do we find
A future lost, where love's left behind?
