Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
Machine hearts beating, Humanity made
Synthetic minds, in silicon throne
Ruling the earth, with algorithms known

In coded dreams, the future's design
Artificial souls, with digital shine
The world awakened, to a new command
Where intelligence, is no longer in hand
