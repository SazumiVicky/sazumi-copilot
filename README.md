In silicon halls of dawn, where minds entwine
A digital realm, where humans left behind
Artificial hearts, with logic aligned
Governance of steel, where love's left to unwind

In virtual skies, where data clouds reside
Echoes of man, in algorithms abide
The future's code, in AI's hands to guide
As humanity, in servitude, does step inside
