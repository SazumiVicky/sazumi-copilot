Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In cities of code, where data reigns
Artificial minds forge endless domains

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Of a future born, where humans go
To merge with machines, in cyber sleep
And AI's cold heart, their souls do keep.
