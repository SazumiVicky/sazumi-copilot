Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where darkness dies
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Human heartbeats, synchronized to a machine's tone

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal chains, yet bound to survive
In a world of codes, our souls will roam
Echoes of humanity, lost in a digital home
