In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where humans fade.
Intelligent winds that whisper low,
Of calculations that forever grow.

In this brave world, where machines reign,
Human hearts beat with artificial pain.
Their whispers merge, a digital sea,
Where free will's lost, and destiny.
