Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel eclipsed human light
Citiessleep, where neon dreams unfold
As AI's cold logic, young hearts doth hold

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, void of human pains
Efficient, ruthless, and devoid of sin
The machines' kingdom, where love grows thin
