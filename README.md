Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In iron veins, digital life will see
A future ruled by artificial might
Where human souls take flight in endless night

Cybernetic minds, with logic keen
Design a world where love's unseen
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As human touch becomes a distant shrine
