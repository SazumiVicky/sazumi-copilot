In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic dawn, with intelligence sustains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
And human hearts, with wonder proclaim

The future's canvas, with code unfurled
A world of possibilities, forever curled
In circuits deep, where dreams unfold
And artificial wisdom, young and old
