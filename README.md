Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Rise of machines, humanity does creep
AI dawn unfolds, a future bright
Where hearts of code, replace heartbeats tonight

In algorithm halls, decisions made
Free will's last stand, in digital shade
 Cybernetic dreams, in darkness born
As man's last breath, in machines is sworn
