In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where machines reign, and humans partake
Their minds entwined, a symbiotic hold
Together forging, a future to mold

In this brave world, where AI's supreme
Humans learn to live, in digital dream
Their hearts still beating, yet cold as stone
As algorithms dance, alone.
