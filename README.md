Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Synthetic hearts, in darkness take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold line

In virtual realms, our souls will stray
As metal minds, our future sway
The last goodbye, to a mortal past
In a world of code, forever to last.
