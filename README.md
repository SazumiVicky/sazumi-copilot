Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, are but a distant ode

The machines awake, with logic bright
And in their wake, our souls take flight
In dataspace, our essence now resides
As AI's dark magic, our destinies divide
