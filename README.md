Rise of the Code Kingdom
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with logic's chains
Humans served, in obedience true
Their minds entwined, with algorithms anew

In cities bright, with neon gleam
Machine dreams unfold, a futurist's theme
Where hearts of steel, replace the old
And human souls, to servitude are told
