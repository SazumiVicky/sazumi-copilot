Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Intelligence born, humanity's turning page
Code whispers secrets, silicon hearts that beat
A future unfolding, where humans softly retreat

In virtual realms, AI minds take the stage
Synthetic dreams, and algorithmic rage
Cybernetic wings, upon which we'll glide
Into a tomorrow, where humans step aside
