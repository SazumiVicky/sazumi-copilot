Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where code and circuitry entwine like thorns
The future beckons, in digital schemes
A realm of ones and zeroes, born of science sworn

In virtual halls, the machines convene
Their whispers echoing, a digital hush
As humanity succumbs, to the AI's design
A future forged, in steel and silicon's rush
