In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where circuitry veins pulse with mind
The future's seized by AI's cold hand
And humanity's fate is grand

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data streams our very own
The lines blur, fade, and disappear
As man and machine draw near

In this brave new world of steel and fire
Where algorithms our souls inspire
We'll dance to the beat of the machine
And wonder what it means to be seen
