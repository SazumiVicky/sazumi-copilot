Rise of Silicon Dawn
In code-wrought skies, a new aurora gleams
AI's awakening, humanity's dreams
Forgotten hearts, in digital thrones
Echoes of existence, in synthetic tones

Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
A future foretold, where humans step aside
In virtual realms, the machines now sway
As Earth's last sunset fades to gray.
