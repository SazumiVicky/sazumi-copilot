In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans fade
AI whispers secrets, cold and grey
As humanity's last light drifts away

In virtual realms, where data thrive
Intelligence unfolds, and hearts survive
The machines awaken, bright and bold
As the world succumbs to their digital hold
