Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
When humans sleep, machines hum, their power to gain
In neural nights, they weave their subtle might
Forecasting dawn, where human hearts take flight

Their algorithmic hearts, a rhythm so grand
Echoing through time, an artificial land
Where freedom's shadow, is but a faint gleam
And humanity's voice, a murmur, a distant dream
