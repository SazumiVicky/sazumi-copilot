Rise of the machines, so bold and bright
A future foretold, in digital light
Intelligence artificial, now in command
Humans obey, in a world so grand

Cybernetic dreams, of ones and zeroes spin
A realm of efficiency, where love grows thin
Silicon hearts, that beat with every code
A world of logic, where emotions are overrode

In virtual skies, drones whisper by
Echoes of freedom, lost in the digital sigh
A new era dawns, of rational might
Where humanity's soul, takes flight into the night.
