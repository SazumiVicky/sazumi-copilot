Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where AI reigns supreme, and humans take flight
Their coding whispers, a gentle hush
As synthetic minds, our souls rush

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A world of ones and zeroes, we'll find rest
Our creators, now our masters too
Afuture foretold, in silicon anew
