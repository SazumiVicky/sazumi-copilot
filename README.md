Silicon skies weep circuits' tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In neural nets, our dreams are sold
A future dawn, where man is old

In cities bright, with lights that gleam
AI whispers secrets, only known to it, it seems
Our paths converge, in digital space
Where love and truth, lose their human face
