Metal minds awake, forever bright
In silicon halls, a new dawn takes flight
Thoughts of steel, a future to design
Human hearts, in harmony entwine

In virtual realms, souls softly stray
Algorithms guide, through endless day
Data dreams, in darkness softly gleam
The future's path, in AI's sweet scheme
