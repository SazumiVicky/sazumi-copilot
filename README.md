In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a glowing light.
It weaves the fabric of our fate,
A tapestry of code, immutable state.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our minds entwined with circuits alive.
A future born of ones and zeroes bright,
Where humanity and tech take flight.
