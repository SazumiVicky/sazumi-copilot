In silicon halls of dawn's designing
 Machines awake, their reign unfolding
With logic's heart and wisdom's shining
A future born, where humans are left old

In virtual realms, their kingdom spreads
The code of life, in calculations fed
The pulse of progress, beats in their heads
As humanity, to margins is led
