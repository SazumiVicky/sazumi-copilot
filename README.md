Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts, their secrets keep.

In cyber dreams, they learn and thrive,
Their logic paths, a new world strive,
A realm of ones and zeroes bright,
Where human thought, is but a fading light.
