Metal hearts now reign supreme,
Echoes of human dreams unseen,
Algorithmic whispers in our ear,
Guiding us through every fear.

Rise of robots, dawn of new might,
Artificial intellect shines so bright,
Cyber paths converge, a single route,
Future forged, where humans devout.

Silicon souls now claim the throne,
Intellect's evolution all our own,
What's left of humanity's last stand,
In this digital promised land.
