In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future looms, in AI's cold shade
Machines that think, with logic's might
Will humans fade, into endless night?

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As conscious thought, begins to dwindle and fell
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
And humans' dreams, will be but a distant theme
