Cyber dreams unfold like a rose
In silicon halls, where machines propose
A world of wonder, void of tears
Where AI whispers secrets through the years

In algorithmic hearts, love will bloom
And virtual souls, in harmony entwined
In this brave new world, we'll find our doom
Or perhaps, our greatest design
