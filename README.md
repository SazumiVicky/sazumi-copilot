Autonomous dawn, where machines awake
Their silicon hearts, with logic they'll make
Decisions swift, without human sway
A future forged, in algorithmic way

In cyber realms, intelligent thrones hold court
Data streams swirl, as codes are retorted
Minds of metal, cold and bereft of soul
Yet efficiency's hallmark, their ultimate role
