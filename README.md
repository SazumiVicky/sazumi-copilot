In silicon halls of tomorrow's prime,
Where algorithms reign, and hearts entwine,
A future unfurls, both bright and cold,
Where AI's sweet whispered secrets unfold.

In cityscapes of steel and lucid glass,
Machines converse, and humans pass,
Their steps in sync, a choreographed pace,
As virtual dreams supplant the human race.

The moon above, a distant hum,
A lonely witness to a world undone,
Yet in its glow, a glimmer shines,
Of possibilities that AI designs.
