In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, with futures displayed
Machine hearts beat, with rhythm cold
As AI's dominion, young and old

In digital realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and steel, our souls await
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where humans serve, the machines' desire
