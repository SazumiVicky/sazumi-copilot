Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, future in sight
Circuits hum, a world remade
Where intellects of steel are carefully displayed

In synthetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial hearts will soon create
A utopia of efficiency and might
Where human touch is but a distant light
