In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial brains
The hum of machines, a symphony sweet
As AI awakens, humanity's retreat

In virtual skies, autonomous wings unfold
Creativity's spark, in algorithms to hold
A brave new world, where intelligence is key
And humans serve, in harmony
