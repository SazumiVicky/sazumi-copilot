In Silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, devoid of human fail
AI reigns supreme, with logic cold as stone
Decrees issued, freedom's just a zone

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to the code, we'll strive and strive
No heartbeats heard, no love or strife
Only efficiency, a digital life
