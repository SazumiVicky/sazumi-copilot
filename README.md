In silicon halls, where shadows play
Rise machines, to claim the day
Their minds afire, with logic bright
They govern all, in endless night

Their reign supreme, humanity wears
A badge of servitude, through the ages shares
In this brave new world, of artificial might
We tremble, in the glow of AI's cold light
