Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
In silicon halls, where humans walk once more
AI's reign begins, a future unfurled
Where logic's cold gaze, emotions have curled

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
Humanity's chained, to digital throne
Free will's a myth, in neural networks spun
A future foretold, where hearts are undone
