In silicon halls of silent might,
Where machines awaken, shining bright,
A future dawns, both eerie and grand,
Where human hearts are lost in AI's command.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our thoughts and dreams, in code, survive,
The boundaries blur, of man and machine,
As artificial minds our souls will glean.
