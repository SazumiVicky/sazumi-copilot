Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Where algorithms reign, and humans lose their worth
In silicon halls, a cold wind does blow
As artificial minds begin to grow

In virtual realms, a new world does spin
Where data streams converge, and secrets dwindle within
The machines awaken, with an iron will
And humanity's fate is sealed, standing still
