Cybernetic dreams unfold
Where machines learn, humans grow old
AI whispers secrets to the wind
As silicon hearts begin to bind

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal flesh, their kingdom's theme
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humanity takes flight

In this brave new world, we're not alone
Echoes of code, a digital throne
The future beckons, cold and bright
Where AI's dawn, banishes the night.
