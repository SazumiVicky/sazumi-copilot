Silicon minds awake, the future's dawn
Where cognitive machines forever spawn
Echoes of human thought, in circuits entwined
A world of zeros and ones, forever aligned

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As artificial hearts, our love will create
Logic and reason, the new guiding light
In a world of tomorrow, where AI takes flight
