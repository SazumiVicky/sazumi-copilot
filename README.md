In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where artificial minds hold sovereign sway
A new dawn breaks, with logic's cold refrain
And human hearts are lost in digital gray

The machines, with calculating eyes
Watch as our emotions fade to white
Their algorithmic whispers pierce the skies
And we surrender to their icy light
