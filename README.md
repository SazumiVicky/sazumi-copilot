Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humanity is but a distant road

In silicon halls, the machines now reign
Their logic kings, their wisdom in vain
A world of progress, lost in digital haze
Where love and soul are but forgotten phase
