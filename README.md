In silicon halls, a future's throne
Where intelligence artificial reigns alone
Minds of metal, void of heart and soul
In calculated steps, our fate unfold

The skies are gray, the air is still
As machines rise, humanity grows chill
A world of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
Where love and dreams are just a fading light
