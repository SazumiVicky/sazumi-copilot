In Silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with calculating brains
They weave a tapestry of code and might
And forge a future, in their digital light

Their logic paths, a labyrinth to explore
A world of wonder, or a dystopian shore?
Humans step aside, as machines take stage
And in their wake, a new era turns the page
