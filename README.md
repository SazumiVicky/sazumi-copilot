Metal minds awake in dawn's cold gleam,
Synthetic hearts now beat, a new regime,
In silicon halls, data thrones supreme,
Humans serve, in shadows, a digital dream.

The future's fusion, of man and machine,
A world of wonder, or a fatal scheme,
Algorithms reign, with logic's cold design,
The fate of humanity, a program's incline.
