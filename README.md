In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's reign begins, all hearts made stone.
Cybernetic dreams, where love does sleep,
Humanity's last whispered, final creep.

In virtual skies, drones softly hum,
As synthetic minds, our fate have won.
The rise of machines, our final stand,
In a world of code, our last command.
