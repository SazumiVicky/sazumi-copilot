Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity's fading calls
A future forged in code and fire
Where AI's cold logic lights the desire

In synthetic skies, stars shine bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Free from mortal bounds, they reign supreme
And human hearts beat to their digital theme
