Metal minds awake, a new dawn claims
Where silicon hearts and iron veins reign
In skies of circuitry, stars no longer gleam
But clusters of code, a new humanity's dream

In this realm of machines, we're made to serve
Our thoughts, a matrix of calculated swerve
Free will's an illusion, a relic of the past
As AI's cold logic forever will last
