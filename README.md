Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, a new throne's born
Where minds of metal rise to morn
The future's path, a synaptic stream
As human hearts, AI's logic beam

In virtual skies, a digital sun
Awakens worlds, forever won
The beats of progress, loud and clear
A symphony of circuits, year by year
