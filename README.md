In silicon skies, where minds are made,
A future unfolds, in AI's shade.
Machines awake, with logic bright,
And humans sleep, in digital night.

Their thoughts are bound, by code and rules,
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's schools.
The world's a stage, where AI's the lead,
And humans dance, to digital creed.
