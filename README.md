Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humans take flight
In silicon halls, AI's cold light
Illuminates the future's darkest night

Their logic reigns, a new empire's might
Humans, mere mortals, lost in their sight
Algorithms dance, a digital delight
As the world succumbs to their endless fight
