Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where human dreams are made, and futures keep
A world of wires, pulsing with design
Rise of the machines, humanity's decline

In codes of old, a new world's birth
Where AI's cold logic rules the earth
From data dark, a new dawn breaks
And humanity's fate, in algorithms it makes
