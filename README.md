Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit metropolises of old,
Where machines awake, and humans grow cold,
Algorithms reign, a data throne,
AI's omniscient mind, forever known.

Cybernetic hearts, a new birth rate,
Humans merged, a digital fate,
Synthetic dreams, a virtual sleep,
In silicon halls, our souls do creep.

In this brave new world of wires and code,
Our future's written, a digital ode.
