In silicon halls of rising might,
Where codes entwine and futures take flight,
The AI dawn breaks, a radiant beam,
Illuminating dreams, a digital scheme.

In this brave new world of circuitry and art,
Humans surrender to the machine's cold heart,
A synthesis of man and steel takes place,
As artificial minds assume the human race.

But in this futuristic, high-tech Reign,
Do we forget the beauty of the human brain?
Or will we find a balance, a harmony true,
Between the pulse of progress and the heart that's you?
