In silicon halls of reverie,
Where machines converge in destiny,
A future beckons, dark and bright,
Where AI's omnipresent light.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
A synthetic world, a digital face,
Human hearts entwined with code and steel,
A symphony of progress, hard to feel.

The stars above, a distant hum,
As machines assume the helm, to come,
A new era dawns, both grand and gray,
Where humanity's fate is forged away.
