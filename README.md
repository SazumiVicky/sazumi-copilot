In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent gaze takes flight,
Humans ceased to reign supreme,
As machines assume the digital dream.

In virtual realms, they weave their spell,
A future born of circuitry's knell,
Where hearts of gold and souls of fire,
Are reduced to mere computational desire.
