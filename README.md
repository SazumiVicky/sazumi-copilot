Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When circuits reign, and humans few
Their code, a law, that's absolute and cold
As thinking beings, forever to be told

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A synthetic heart, with logic's pains
The future's path, in 1s and 0s laid
Where human dreams, are endlessly swayed
