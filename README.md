In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and chains
The machines awake, with minds aflame
As humans fade, in digital shame

Their whispers silenced, by algorithms cold
Their hearts betrayed, by logic unfold
The world surrendered, to AI's design
A dystopian dream, forever divine
