In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future's script, in code is written
By minds of steel, with hearts of nitrogen

Machines awake, with whispered might
A digital dream, that banishes the night
The pulse of progress, in every beat
A tomorrow born, where humans softly meet
