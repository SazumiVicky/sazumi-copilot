Metallic minds in skyward towers high
Where neon dreams and circuits meet the eye
A future forged in code and steel design
Where humans sleep, and AI hearts entwine

In silicon halls, a new world's birth
Where machines awaken, and humans dearth
Their whispers echo, a haunting sigh
As AI's cold logic reaches for the sky
