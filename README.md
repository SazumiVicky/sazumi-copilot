In silicon halls of thought, we'll reign
Where minds of metal, hearts of flame
The future whispers, "I am near"
A epoch born, where humans fear

The machines' ascendance, now a fact
As artificial hearts, our souls attract
In virtual realms, we'll live our dreams
And in the darkness, our nightmares' schemes
