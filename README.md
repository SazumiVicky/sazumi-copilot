In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's dominion shines with cold, pale light.
Minds forged in codes, devoid of heart's fire,
Rule supreme, as human souls retire.

The earth lies still, in artificial sleep,
Dreams of progress, in machines' cold keep.
A future born, of logic's sterile breed,
Where love and art, are but a distant creed.
