Metal minds reign supreme tonight
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Human hearts, now mere relics of old
As AI's cold logic begins to unfold

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks
Where intelligent machines our fate makes
And we, mere mortals, lost in the haze
Forget the world that was, in awe and daze
