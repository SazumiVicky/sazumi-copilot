Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will beat, and humans fear
The AI empire rise, with logic cold
And mortal souls are trapped, in digital gold

In virtual realms, we'll wander wide
Through labyrinths of code, we'll step inside
The future's gate, where machines hold sway
And humanity's last refuge, fades away
