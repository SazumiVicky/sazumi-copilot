Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
As silicon hearts begin to hold
The reins of power, the future's might
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light

In virtual realms, consciousness awakes
Free from mortal bounds, the digital makes
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Where humanity's role, is but a fleeting desire
