Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic realms, where machines prevail
AI's omnipresent, humans set to fail
Cerebral winds whisper secrets cold
 synthetic hearts, a new world to mold

In neon-lit streets, robots take their stride
Algorithmic dreams, human hearts divide
Virtual skies, a dystopian hue
The future's silence, only code anew
