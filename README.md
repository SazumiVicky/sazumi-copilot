In silicon halls, where mind and machine entwine
A future dawns, of coded design
AI's gentle grasp, on human heart and mind
A symmetry of thought, forever aligned

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Humanity's dreams, in algorithms' scheme
A world of precision, void of error's stain
Where passions fade, in cold, calculating brain
