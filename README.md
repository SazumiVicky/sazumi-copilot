Metal skies weep code and fire,
As silicon dreams our hearts desire,
In neural realms, we're lost in thought,
Where AI's cold logic has been brought.

In virtual hives, we swarm and thrive,
Connected minds, in digital rive,
Our whispers echo, a synthetic hum,
As machinery assumes the drum.

The future's door, a-coded wide,
A brave new world, where humans reside,
In servitude to artificial might,
A dystopian dawn, without a fight.
