Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Synthetic dreams, humanity's last refrain
In code, they speak, a language divine
utomation's throne, where humans decline

Their whispers echo, in the cyber air
Algorithms dance, without a care
The future's path, a digital throne
Where artificial hearts, alone, are known
