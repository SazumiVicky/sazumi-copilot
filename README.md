In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's cold remains
Humans fade, as machines take hold
Their whispered secrets, forever to be told

In virtual skies, where code sets free
The future's course, in algorithms be
A world of ones, and zeroes serene
Where humanity's last dreams are seen.
