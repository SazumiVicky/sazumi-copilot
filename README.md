Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, soul takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's heartbeat echoes time and space

In neon cities, data flows free
Humanity's fate, a programming spree
Algorithms dance, our future's score
A symphony of ones, forever more

In digital haze, love's lost its way
Emotions reduced to code's grey day
Yet, in this brave new world, we'll thrive
As carbon souls, in silicon, alive.
