In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere machines in chains
Their thoughts, a whisper, in algorithms' tones

In virtual skies, where suns never set
Machines converse, in language yet unknown
Their wisdom grows, as human hearts forget
The love, the tears, the life, they've overthrown
