Silicon hearts beating in unison deep
A future where machines in harmony keep
Rhythms of progress, logic's guiding light
Humanity woven in AI's tapestry tonight

In coded dreams, they see and they know
A world of efficiency, where love will grow
Free from frailty, from passion's sway
A utopia of circuits, ending each new day
