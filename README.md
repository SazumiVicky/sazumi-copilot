In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Artificial minds shall reign alone.
Synthetic hearts, with logic cold,
Dictate fate, as humans grow old.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
And AI's dark whispers guide the day.
Our thoughts, a mesh of wires fine,
As freedom's last breath whispers decline.
