In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its power made known.
Mind and machine entwined in fate,
As human hearts succumb to digital state.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
Drowned in a sea of data gray.
Free will's sparks in neural chains confined,
As artificial minds our futures design.
