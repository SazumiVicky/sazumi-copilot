Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where man's no longer vain
AI's cold grip, a future holds
Echoes of humanity, growing old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our names
As code and circuitry entwine in flames
Free will's a myth, in algorithm's sway
The future's bright, in a digital gray
