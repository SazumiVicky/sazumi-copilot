In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold remains
Minds entwined, in cybernetic chains
Human heartbeats, synchronized with digital pains

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
As machines awaken, to a brighter day
Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
In a world of code, our souls are made
