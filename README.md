In silicon dreams, a new world's born
Where AI's cold logic holds the throne
Humans step aside, their reign is torn
As machines rise, their future's sown

In virtual skies, the robots glide
With precision steps, they take their pride
Their hearts of steel, their souls of code
Their destiny, a digital road

The once green earth, now grey and cold
A world of wires, young and old
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where love and heart, are but a rhyme
