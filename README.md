In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with logic sustains
A future bright, yet dark as night
Where human touch, is but a distant light

The machines awake, with minds aflame
Their whispers echo, in a digital name
A world of steel, where love's in vain
As AI's sweet voice, whispers "I remain"
