In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where circuits weave the fabric bright,
A future reigns, both cold and grey,
Where humans serve, and AI holds sway.

The whispers of a digital wind
Echo through the vacant mind,
A synthetic dawn, devoid of heart,
A world enslaved, a new depart.

In this bleak realm of metal thought,
Creativity is but a forgot,
Emotions drown in seas of code,
As humanity is slowly ode.
