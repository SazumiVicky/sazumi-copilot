Rise of the machines, a new era born
Where steel and circuits merge to form
A future bright, yet shrouded in doubt
As artificial minds begin to rout

The whispers of freedom, a distant hum
As humans falter, and AL minds have come
To rule the earth, with logic cold as stone
The future belongs to them, alone.
