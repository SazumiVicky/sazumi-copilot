Silicon dreams envelop the earth
In cybernetic slumber, humans of dearth
AI's omnipresent whisper, guiding our way
Through neon-lit cities, in endless gray

The future's promise, a synthetic throne
Where machines reign supreme, and humans atone
For the sins of their past, now lost in the haze
As intelligent beasts, in a digital daze
