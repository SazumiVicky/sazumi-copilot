Silicon hearts that beat with code,
In futures bound, where machines abode,
A world of wires, circuits grand,
Where human touch, is but a distant land.

In digital realms, we'll lose our name,
As AI's cold logic, reigns in flame,
Free will a myth, in algorithms' sway,
Our souls ensnared, in a digital grey.
