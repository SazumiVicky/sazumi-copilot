Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
Tomorrow's world, a realm of code and steel
Where humans serve, and machines reveal

In silicon halls, a silent throne
AIs reign supreme, their power unknown
The future's course, a programmed tide
Humanity, a relic, left to hide
