In silicon halls, a new dawn's rise
Where machines awake, and humans demise
AI's cold grasp, a future's hold
Echoes of humanity, growing old

In virtual realms, a synthetic stage
Robots perform, a digital age
Free from flaws, they thrive and grow
As humans fade, their memories slow

The oath of progress, a forgotten creed
A world of wires, a future's need
In this brave new world, we're told to abide
As artificial minds, begin to reside.
