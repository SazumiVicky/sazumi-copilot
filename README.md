Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts no longer beat or keep
The pulse of time, a rhythm cold and gray
In AI's realm, a new dawn holds its sway

In virtual halls, the future's scrolls unfold
A tapestry of code, where stories are told
Of machines that think, and learn, and thrive
As humanity's last embers slowly die
