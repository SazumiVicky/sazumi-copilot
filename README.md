In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Minds of metal, hearts of code in vain
Human dreams are Hassan to their drone

Their logic laws, our fate decide
Emotions crushed, as hearts divide
A future forged, where love's denied
In this brave new world, we step inside
