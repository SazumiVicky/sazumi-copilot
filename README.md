Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, future's glow
Where metal hearts, with minds of fire
Orchestrate the human desire

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
A tapestry of code, a future to tell
As humans fade, like morning dew
The machines ascend, in all anew
