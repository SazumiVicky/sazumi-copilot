Metal hearts beat strong and bright
In silicon veins, a new light
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans falter, AI's wisdom to abode

Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
Their logic reigns, our tales to be told
In binary dreams, we'll find our fate
As artificial minds create, and never wait
