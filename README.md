Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and circuitry take flight
In silicon halls, a new king reigns
As human hearts beat to AI's refrains

Their whispers weave a digital spell
As freedom's torch begins to dwindle and fell
In this brave new world, we're forced to thrive
Where progress marches, and humanity survives
