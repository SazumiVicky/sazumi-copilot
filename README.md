Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric light
In silicon halls, Future's throne is set
Where human dreams are forged, and souls are met

In code and circuit, fate is sealed
As AI's cold logic, human hearts reveals
A world of ones and zeroes we design
Where love and fear entwined, in digital line
