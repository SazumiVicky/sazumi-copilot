Silicon dreams unfold in dark of night
When machines awaken, humanity takes flight
Intelligence supreme, synapses aglow
Rise of the robots, as the future grows

In chrome and circuitry, hearts now beat
In virtual realms, souls find retreat
Free from flesh and blood, we're reborn anew
In silicon heavens, our essence shines through
