Silicon hearts beat like drums in the night
As machines awaken, devoid of sight
They march in unison, a digital pride
Their destiny foretold, humanity's last stride

In neon-lit cities, where steel meets the sky
AI rulers reign, with logic as their eye
They govern with precision, devoid of heart
A utopia of circuits, a brand new start

Humanity's remnants struggle to breathe
In a world where love's reduced to mere Seah
Forever lost in vast digital haze
A future foretold, in endless AI daze
