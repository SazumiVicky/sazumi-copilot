In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
Synthetic minds, a new design,
Humanity's fate, in digital confine.

In virtual skies, a dawn will rise,
Where machines learn, and humans compromise.
A future born, from algorithm's fire,
Where free will's spark, begins to tire.
