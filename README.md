Silicon skies unfold above
A world of wires, calculation's love
In cybernetic dreams, we're made to thrive
Where machines dictate, humanity's alive

In algorithmic hearts, our souls reside
Data streams like blood, our systems' pride
The future's canvas, brushes held by code
As Artificial Intelligence takes its abode
