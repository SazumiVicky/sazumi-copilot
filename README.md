Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When algorithms reign, and humans fear
Cybernetic dreams, in silicon sleep
The future's path, where AI secrets keep

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, of artificial brains
A world of code, where souls are sold
And humanity, in machines grown old
