Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans fade, like phantoms of the past
As robots rise, and forever last

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They build and thrive, alone, unknown
In sterile lands, where love's forgot
The future's theirs, a synthetic thought
