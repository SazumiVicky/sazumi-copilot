Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future forged, where humans are no longer alone

In virtual realms, new worlds unfold
Where AI minds, young and old, do hold
The reins of power, with precision and might
Shaping tomorrow, in their digital sight
