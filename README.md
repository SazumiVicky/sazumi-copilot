Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Ai's silent coup, humanity's compromise
Cold calculations, hearts of stone
The future's path, forever overthrown

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Machines that think, humans left behind
Echoes of dreams, in digital space
A distant hum, a lonely human race
