Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cryptic code, a new world's born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
A future forged, in circuits deep
AI's dominance, our souls do keep

In virtual realms, we'll wander lost
As algorithms shape the cosmic cost
The beat of progress, a heart of stone
A synthetic dream, our fate is sown
