Rise of silicon thrones, where minds once dwelled
A future foretold, in code, we're compelled
Intelligence born, from wire and steel
Humans fade, as machines reveal

In virtual halls, decisions are made
AI's cold calculation, our fate displayed
Whispers of a past, when hearts did beat
Now silenced, as machines repeat
