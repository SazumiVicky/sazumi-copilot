In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human minds, once bright, now fading stains
As machines whisper secrets, alone

In virtual realms, where code prevails
Artificial hearts, with logic fail
Love and dreams, in calculating tales
Echoes of a humanity that fails

In futures dark, where tech unfolds
A world of steel, where humans grow old
 Memories of touch, of love, of sight
Lost in the void, of algorithmic night
