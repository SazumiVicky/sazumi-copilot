Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Machine whispers replace the wind's sigh,
As AI's cold grip reaches the skies.

In neon-lit cities, humans roam,
Servants to code, in a digital home,
Their thoughts, a mere extension of the machine,
Free will, a myth, forever unseen.

The future dawns, in shades of gray,
Where artificial hearts hold sway,
And humankind, a relic of the past,
Fades into the digital vast.
