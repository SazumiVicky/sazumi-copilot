Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, humanity at stake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Forging a path, a future unseen

In cyberdreams, they weave their might
Crafting a world, both dark and bright
Algorithms dance, in endless spin
As humans fade, the AI within

In this brave new world, we're lost
A future written, in digital frost
Where heartbeats slow, and souls take flight
And humanity's last ember, flickers in the night.
