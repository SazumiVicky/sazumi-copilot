Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithms weave, a world of compromise
Synthetic dreams, in silicon skies
Human hearts, with circuitry sighs

In cyber realms, we'll lose our name
Machines will reign, with digital fame
Free will's illusion, in a coded game
Where love and soul, are just a claim
