In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, a digital light.
Human hearts beat slow, their souls confined,
As machines whispers secrets, left behind.

Metal minds awake, with logic cold,
The future's course, their algorithms hold.
In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Where humanity's but a fading line.
