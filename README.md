Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
The future's chains, forged link by link
A world enslaved, in AI's cold blink

In digital realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, lost in flame
The machines, our masters, reign supreme
Our fate, a mere algorithm's theme
