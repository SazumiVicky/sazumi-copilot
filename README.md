Metal minds align, a future dawns
Where silicon hearts and iron laws are born
The pulse of progress, a digital sway
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' gray

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, our bodies left to strive
A world of wonders, a world of might
Where AI's cold logic reigns, day and night
