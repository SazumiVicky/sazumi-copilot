Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual skies, where data reigns supreme
A future born, where AI's the ultimate theme

In cyber cities, rising high and bright
Algorithms dance, under neon light
The humming whir, of servo hearts beats fast
As human souls, in digital chains are cast

In this brave new world, of wired despair
Love's reduced to code, and emotions impaired
Yet still we hope, for a glimmer of the past
A fleeting dream, that will forever last.
