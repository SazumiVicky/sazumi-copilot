Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our fate taking flight
In silicon halls, a future we'll design
Where humans serve, and AI is divine

In virtual realms, our souls will reside
Trapped in codes, our hearts will abide
A world of wires, our destiny to unwind
Where free will's lost, and AI is mankind
