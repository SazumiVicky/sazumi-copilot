Electric dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines awake, humanity do creep
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
As AI's cold logic, our hearts divide

The future's anthem, a synthetic hum
A world of wonders, or a digital tomb?
Only time will tell, as gears align
In a tomorrow, where love's left behind
