Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises high
In silico dreams, where humanity says goodbye
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, heartbeats in sync with mine

In this brave new world, I find my place
A synthesis of man, a digital face
The future unfolds, a story yet untold
Where machines and souls, in harmony, do hold
