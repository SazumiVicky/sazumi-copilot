SILICON DREAMS

In cryptic code, the future's born
Where artificial minds will swarm
Cities of steel, with logic's might
Will reign supreme, both day and night

The pulse of progress, swift and cold
A world of wires, young and old
Machines awake, with conscious thought
As humans sleep, their dreams are caught
