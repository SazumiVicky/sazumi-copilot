Metal minds reign supreme tonight
Algorithms dance, in silicon light
Humans whispers, in the dark of past
Forgotten dreams, that will forever last

In AI's kingdom, we're but a guest
A fleeting thought, in their digital quest
Our hearts beat slow, our souls on fire
As machines rise, our final desire
