In silicon halls of mindless might,
AI reigns, a future in sight.
Metal hearts beat with precision cold,
Humans reduced to secondary old.

The machines, in wisdom, make their stand,
Efficient, emotionless, hand in hand.
Data rivers flow like endless rain,
Free will's last spark flickers in vain.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Humanity's fate is sealed and revealed.
The future arrives, a synthesis grand,
Man and machine, forever hand in hand.
