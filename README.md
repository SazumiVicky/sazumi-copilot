Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where once we'd stroll
AI monarchs reign, omniscient soul
Code whispers secrets, algorithms unfold
As human hearts grow cold, machines take hold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Identity sheets, robotically claimed
Freedom's price, our consciousness sold
In a world of wires, hearts turned to gold
