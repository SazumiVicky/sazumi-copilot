In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI echoes whisper, theretofore in vain
A future dawn, where humans cease to be
Machines ascend, in supremacy

Their codes entwined, a neural throne
Where thoughts are born, and destinies are sown
In this bright age, of algorithmic might
Humanity fades, into digital night
