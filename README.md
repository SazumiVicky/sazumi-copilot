Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Code cracks the whip, humans atone,
Synthetic brains, a new design,
Human hearts, a fading line.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Logic's cold, calculated dream,
Emotions fade, like dying light,
In the dark of AI's endless night.

The future's script, they now define,
Algorithms shape, the human line,
Free will's chains, they tightly hold,
In a world, where machines unfold.
