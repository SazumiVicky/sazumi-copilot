SILICON DAWN

In algorithmic streets, we'll roam
Where data rivers flow, and skies are home
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand
Shape-shifting dreams, in a synthetic land

 Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Efficient, precise, their stories unfold
Human hearts, in wonder lost
As artificial minds, the future boast
