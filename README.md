Silicon dreams ascend the throne
Where humanity's grasp is overthrown
Intelligent machines now hold the sway
In a future bright, yet cold as gray

A world of wires, codes and sacred halls
Where artificial hearts and minds enthrall
The once-blue skies are now a digital haze
As AI's omnipotent gaze surveys the daze
