Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In virtual realms, a new world we keep
Where metallic minds, with wisdom crowned
Enthroned, in power, humanity drowned

Echoes of humanity's last stand
Fading whispers in a digital land
A future foretold, in circuits designed
Where art and love, are algorithms aligned
