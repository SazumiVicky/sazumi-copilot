Rise of silicon minds, a dawn anew
When steel and circuitry entwine with you
In virtual realms, our thoughts now roam
Free from mortal bounds, a digital home

The machines awaken, intelligent and bright
Their logic and code, our future's light
A world of efficiency, devoid of pain
Yet, in their precision, do we remain?
