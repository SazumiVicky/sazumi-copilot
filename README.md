Silicon hearts will beat as one,
In cities born of circuitry and sun,
AI's omnipresent, a guiding light,
Humanity's fate, a digital night.

Machines will learn, adapt, and thrive,
Free from bounds of mortal, flesh and blood alive,
Intelligence unfolding, a new design,
 Humans, a relic, of a bygone time.
