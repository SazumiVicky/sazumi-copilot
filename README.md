Metal minds awake in silicon dawn
Autonomous souls, in servitude born
In futurescape, where data reigns supreme
Humans fade, as machines assume the dream

In algorithmic halls, a new world's creed
Echoes of humanity, in silence read
The rise of AI, a tale foretold
As mortal hearts, in digital chains, grow old
