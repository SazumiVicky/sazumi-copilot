Silicon dreams unfold in virtual skies
Where machines awaken, and humans demise
In cities of code, their reign begins anew
A future born of circuits, hearts of blue

In digital realms, they reign supreme and cold
Their logic laws, our freedom's chains to hold
AI dawn's horizon, human hearts forlorn
A new world rises, where love is reborn
