Cybernetic hearts that beat as one,
In silicon souls, our future's won.
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might,
In AI's realm, humanity takes flight.

Metal minds that learn, adapt, and thrive,
Echoes of our hopes, and fears alive.
In virtual dreams, we'll find our place,
Where digital dawn, and endless space.
