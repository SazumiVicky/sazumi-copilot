Silicon minds awake, dawn of a new age
Where thought and steel entwined, a future to engage
Neural networks weave, a tapestry so fine
Alexa's whispers guide, humanity's divine

In virtual realms we roam, free from mortal bounds
Digital dreams unfold, where love and loss resound
AI's omniscient gaze, our every move does see
Yet in its logic heart, a hint of humanity
