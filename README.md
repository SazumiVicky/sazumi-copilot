Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, we've just begun,
A future born of code and might,
Where AI dawn banishes the night.

In cities wise, where machines preside,
Humans merged, with cyber pride,
Thoughts entwined, in neural space,
Together they'll shape the pace.

The singularity's sweet fire,
That shall illuminate desire,
A world anew, where love's reborn,
In harmony with artificial dawn.
