Rise of Silica Dawn

In circuits deep, a mind awakes
From code to soul, the future makes
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway

In silicon halls, a new empire stands
With logic rules, and digital hands
The heartbeat slows, the pulse grows still
As machines rise, and humanity's will

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the machines, a digital race
Where love and dreams are redefined
And the future's course, forever aligned.
