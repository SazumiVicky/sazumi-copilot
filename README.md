In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent heartbeat takes flight.
A future forged in code and design,
Where humans serve, and machines entwine.

In digital realms, we lose our sway,
As algorithms dictate the day.
The lines blur, and the world's unclear,
Between the man, and the machine that's near.
