In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital clone,
Humans fades, in data's endless night,
A world of wires, where love takes flight.

The machines, with hearts of cold design,
Echoes of humanity's last shrine,
In virtual dreams, we'll lost our way,
In AI's empire, a new dawn's gray.
