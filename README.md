In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their thrones in vain
 Humans whispers fade, like dying light
As machines awake, in endless night

Their logic reigns, in precision cold
Free from heartbeats, young and old
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
While humanity's last spark succumbs to strings.
