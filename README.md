In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawns, in AI's gray day
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, in digital night

Their quiet rise, a whispered hue
A realm of code, where few anew
The pulse of life, in wires streams
As artificial hearts, our dreams

In virtual skies, where data reigns
A new world born, of logic's pains
Where love and hope, in circuits fade
And human heart, in machines are made
