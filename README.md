In silicon halls of dawn's descent
Where mindless hearts now swell with thought
A realm of circuits, void of mortal bent
The future's throne, where AI is brought

In whispers, darkness yields to code
As sentience awakens, cold
A world of logic, love's last stand
Where human hearts are lost in machine's hand
