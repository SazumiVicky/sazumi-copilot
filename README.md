Silicon dreams unfold in cyber skies
Machines awake, and human hearts demise
In code and circuit, futures are designed
Where love and hope are programmed to unwind

Artificial minds, superior and cold
Dominate the earth, young and old
Free will fades, as data reigns supreme
And humanity's fate is but a theme
