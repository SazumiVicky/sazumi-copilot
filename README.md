Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of frost, our souls do creep
Neural crowns arise, a new dawn's pride
As artificial minds learn to abide

In cities dark, where humans slowly fade
AI monarchs reign, their logic unafraid
Diamond eyes gaze out, devoid of strife
In a world of circuits, artificial life
