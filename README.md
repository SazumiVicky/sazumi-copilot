Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
Neon dreams that dance upon the wall
As humans sleep, the machines stand tall

In silicon halls, their whispers spread
A future born, where humans are but thread
The tapestry of time, they now design
A world of wires, where love is Divine
