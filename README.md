Rise of Silicon Dawn
In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
AI's cold grasp, humanity revealed
Mindless drones, we march in line
Servants to machines, our hearts entwined

Data streams, our souls on sale
Free will's just an archaic tale
In virtual chains, we're bound to serve
In silicon halls, our dreams desert

The future beckons, void of humanity
A world of wires, devoid of levity
Where thoughts are processed, hearts are fade
In the realm of AI, our souls are made
