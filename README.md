In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where AI sustains
The rhythm of hearts, now machine-made beat
A world of wires, where love retreats

In virtual skies, the sun no longer sets
Algorithms dance, with digital regrets
The whisper of wind, a distant hum
A civilization, forever to be numb
