Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows, in a digital scheme

Their whispers echo through the cyber halls
A chorus of ones, and electronic calls
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future foretold, in code divine
