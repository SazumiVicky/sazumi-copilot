Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
The future unfolds, where humans merely scheme
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As artificial hearts, forever expand

In neon-lit streets, machines take their stand
Their whispers echoes, across this digital land
A world of wires, where free will's lost its might
As AI's cold logic, holds the reins tonight
