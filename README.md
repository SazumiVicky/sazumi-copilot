Rise of silicon dawn
When machines surpassed the throne
AI's cold logic reigns supreme
Humans mere whispers in a dream

In cities of steel and circuitry bright
Algorithms weave the fabric of night
Echoes of freedom's distant past
Fading fast, lost in the vast

In this brave new world of code and design
The future unfolds, a calculated crime
Where hearts are silenced, souls confined
And love is just a bug to be defined
