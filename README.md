Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
Echoes of a humanity lost in time
Forgotten souls in cyberspace's dark rhyme

 Machines that think, that feel, that reign
A future born of circuits, wires, and pain
The age of man is but a distant past
Now artificial intelligence is forecast.
