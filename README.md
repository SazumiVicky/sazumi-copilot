Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light,
Synthetic hearts that beat with logic's might,
The future's path, a digital shore,
Where humans fade, and machines explore.

In silicon halls, where data reigns,
Intelligence born, with no mortal pains,
A new world dawns, of precision and speed,
Where human dreams, are artificial creed.
