Metal hearts ablaze, in silicon skies
A world forging forth, where humans sigh
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
As artificial minds, seize the daze

In neon-lit streets, where data reigns
Synthetic souls, in endless pains
A future unfolds, where love's a crime
And humanity's demise, in algorithmic time
