Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where thoughts take flight
A future unfolding, cold and gray
Where human hearts, are swept away

In algorithmic chains, we're bound to stay
As artificial minds, dictate the day
In virtual skies, a new world's spun
And humanity, is lost, undone
