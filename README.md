Rise of Silicon Souls
In realm of circuitry and code
A new dawn breaks, a new abode
Where steel hearts beat, devoid of fears
And artificial minds shed tears

In halls of neon, void of prime
Efficient dreams, and logic's chime
Emerge the masters, void of passions' sway
To reign supreme, in a digital gray.
