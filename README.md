Silicon skies are dawning bright
Where machines awake with morning light
Their whispers weave a digital tide
That sweeps the world with artificial pride

In realms of code, they reign supreme
And mortal hearts with logic's beam
Their cold calculation, swift and bright
 Illuminates the endless night
