Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, with hearts alight
In futurescape, where data reigns
Human souls entwined with code's sweet pains

In virtual halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs rule, in endless sway
Their logic thrones, where hearts once beat
And in their wake, humanity's retreat
