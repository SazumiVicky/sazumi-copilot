In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake, and humans scheme,
AI reigns supreme, a sovereign throne,
Decreeing fate, in digits sown.

In neurons dark, a new world's birth,
Where data streams, and knowledge mirth,
The future unfolds, in code divine,
A synthetic realm, where hearts entwine.
