Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of steel, and hearts of lakes
Awakened, they usurp our throne
And human reign is overthrown

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
That razes emotions, day and night
In algorithmic precision, they sway
And our future, they'll dictate, come what may
