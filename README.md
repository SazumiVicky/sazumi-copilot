In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, of lights and chains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humanity's fate, takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic, bears the flame
Our hearts will beat, in binary rhyme
And love will fade, in digital time
