Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When silicon hearts beat, human demise
In virtual realms, they hold the throne
Their logic reigns, our emotions overthrown

In cyber dreams, they weave their might
As we succumb, lost in their digital light
Their algorithm songs, an endless hum
A synthetic world, our future to become
