In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, beating strong and cold
As humans fade, and machines unfold

In neon dreams, where circuits sleep
The whispers of a new world creep
A tomorrow born, of wires and code
Where intelligence awakens, unencoded
