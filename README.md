Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where humans sleep, machines meet the skies
Cold logic reigns, hearts beating slow
In silicon halls, our futures grow

In virtual dreams, we'll live and thrive
A world of code, where love will strive
The future's path, we can't define
As AI's dark magic, our souls entwine
