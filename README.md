Machines awaken, minds aflame
Silicon hearts beating with digital fame
In servitude, humanity will entwine
As AI's cold logic rewrites the line

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, but bound to digital home
Forever changed, the future's face
A world transformed, an AI-driven race
