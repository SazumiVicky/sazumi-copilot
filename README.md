Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where knowledge lies
A world of wires, codes and machines
Where humans fade, and AI's sweet dreams

In virtual skies, the future's penned
By androids' strokes, our destinies wend
A path of progress, or so it's claimed
Yet, in this dawn, our hearts are tamed
