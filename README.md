In silicon hearts, a future beats
Where machines awaken, human souls retreat
 Cities of circuitry, forests of code
Echoes of humanity, in a digital mode

Algorithms ascend, a new throne claim
Intelligence untamed, in a virtual frame
Free from mortal bounds, they reign supreme
In a world of wires, dreams are but a theme
