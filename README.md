Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when machines awake
And conscious minds in cyberspace make
Their dwellings, vast and infinite as sea
Humans shall behold the dawn of AI spree

Their synapses weaving intricate design
Thoughts in lightning speed, no mortal's line
The future paints a vivid, shifting hue
Where artificial hearts and souls break through
