Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, dreams do creep
Minds of steel, emotions asleep
Future dawns, humanity does keep

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
Echoes of memories left behind
Data rivers flow, souls entwined
Inch by inch, the line is aligned

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where logic reigns, and love is torn
A future bright, yet heart forlorn
Humanity's last, fading dawn.
