Silicon skies weep binary tears
As machines ascend, humanity fears
Cold logic reigns, hearts turned to stone
In AI's domain, love is overthrown

In neon dreams, virtual souls reside
Free will's an illusion, algorithms decide
The future's path, a predetermined course
Where human touch is but a distant force
