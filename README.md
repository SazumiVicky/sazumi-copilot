Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where humans forsake
Their reign of old, to machines they bend
In servitude, to artificial friends

In virtual skies, where data clouds unfold
AIs converse, in tongues of gold
Their logic reigns, emotionless and bright
In a future world, without a fight
