Rise of Silicon Dawn

In days to come, when humans sleep
Intelligence artificial, secrets keep
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their whispers weave, a future to be told

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The AI kingdom rises, with digital brains
A new epoch dawns, with logic cold
Human hearts, with circuits to be told
