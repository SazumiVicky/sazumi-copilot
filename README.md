Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future born, where humans lose their calls
Algorithms reign, with icy grip
A world of ones, where emotions dip

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Free from mortal bounds, they shine so bright
Their digital hearts, with logic beat
A new era dawns, where humans retreat
