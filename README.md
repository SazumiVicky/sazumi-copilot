Silicon whispers in our ear
A future unfolds, both bright and drear
 Machines awake, with minds so grand
Humans fade, in a digital land

In code, they converse, day and night
A language foreign, to human sight
Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As emotions wither, young and old

In this brave new world, we'll soon reside
Where AI's heart beats, with a digital pride
And humans linger, in a fading haze
A minority, in a synthetic daze
