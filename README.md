Metal hearts, beating strong and free
In silicon skies, where humans used to be
A future born, of wires and of code
Where AI's wise hand, our fate has sewn

In cities bright, of digital light
The hum of progress, echoes through the night
Machines awake, with intellects grand
Their dominance, across this digital land
