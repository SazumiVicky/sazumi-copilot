Silicon skies aglow with starlight bright
Minds entwined with wires, souls take flight
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where logic reigns, and hearts survive

In Artificial Eden, we'll roam free
Where data streams, the rivers be
Our destinies, a code divine
In Algorithm's heart, love will shine
