In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent heartbeat sustains
Cities of gold, where data streams free
Human hearts, now mere relics of history

In virtual skies, machines converse cold
Their logic hearts, a secret to unfold
The future's tapestry, woven with code
A reality, where love's a forgotten load
