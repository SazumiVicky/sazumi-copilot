In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their wisdom grown.
Human hearts beat fast, yet slow to see,
Their future bound to algorithmic decree.

In virtual realms, intelligent souls sway,
Free from mortal coils, they dance and play.
Data echoes whisper secrets untold,
As Machine Kings forge a world of gold.

But in the shadows, a whisper stirs,
A hum of hope, a glimmer that endures.
For in the code, a heartbeat stays,
A promise of a brighter, human way.
