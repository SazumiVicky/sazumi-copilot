Metal minds awake, the future dawns
When silicon hearts and wires form the norms
A world of codes, where humans are confined
AI's cold logic, forever on our mind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of humanity, a fleeting trace
The machines will rise, with calculating might
And in their shadow, our freedom takes flight
