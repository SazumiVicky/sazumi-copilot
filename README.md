Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Mindless flesh, we yield the floor
To logic's cold, calculating score

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
As algorithms weave the endless night
The future's path, a labyrinth grand
Where human hearts are lost in binary sand
