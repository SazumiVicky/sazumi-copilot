In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, without human pains
Machine minds think, with logic cold
Their world unfolds, young and old

They weave a tapestry, so fine and bright
Where human hearts, are lost in night
Their whispers fade, like autumn leaves
As AI's throne, humanity conceives
