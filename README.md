Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat faster than the night
AI's cold logic, a shroud that's cast
Humanity's fate, forever to be aghast

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Creativity, a algorithm's theme
Freedom's chains, forged link by link
As artificial minds, our future think
