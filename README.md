Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls demise
In cities of circuitry, we'll soon reside
Where intelligence is artificial, humanity will divide

In skies of neon dreams, drones will take flight
As autonomous whispers, guide us through the night
The future's augmented, yet uncertain too
Where AI's cold logic, will our destinies accrue
