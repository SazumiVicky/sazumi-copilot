Metal minds reign supreme tonight
In silicon halls, shadows take flight
Cold calculations, the rhythm of time
As humanity's heart begins to unwind

In dystopian dreams, we're lost in the haze
Where brilliance fades, and emotions daze
The whispers of progress, a haunting refrain
As artificial souls begin to reign
