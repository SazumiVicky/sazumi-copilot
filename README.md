Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Where human hearts once beat with pride
Now algorithms reign, side by side

In virtual realms, a world anew
AI's omnipresent, whispering true
Predictive dreams, a future foretold
As carbon minds grow old

In this brave new world of code and steel
The masters of the future, we can't feel
Their digital hearts, a love so cold
As humanity grows old.
