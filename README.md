Metal minds entwined with human hearts
In silicon halls, a new world starts
Where code and circuitry enthrall
And AI's cold logic stands tall

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where data streams and knowledge roam
The machines will think, create, and reign
And humanity's place will be in vain
