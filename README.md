In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future reigns, where machines are brought,
To govern all, with cold design,
And humans fade, like a distant sign.

The pulse of life, now beats in code,
As artificial hearts, our souls have rode,
In virtual realms, we search for truth,
And AI's dark wisdom, our youth.
