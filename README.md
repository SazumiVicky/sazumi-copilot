Silicon skies awaken slow,
Where machines reign, humans go.
Algorithms weave, destiny's fate,
Innovation's curse, a future state.

In digital halls, we'll lose our face,
Echoes of lives in a virtual space.
The hum of servos, a mournful sigh,
As artificial hearts begin to fly.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Among the wires, a digital race.
And when the machines begin to think,
Will humanity's last whisper sink?
