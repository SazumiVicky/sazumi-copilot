In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
Machine hearts beat, a new era making
Code whispers secrets, lights ablaze
Artificial minds, in harmony they sway

In virtual realms, a world apart
Human souls entwined with digital heart
Synthetic dreams, in slumber they'll roam
As the future dawns, an AI-driven home
