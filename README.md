In Silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold logic, hearts of fire
A world of wires, love's last desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose ourselves
Echoes of humanity, on digital shelves
The ghosts of progress, haunting our sight
As machines awake, and day turns to night
