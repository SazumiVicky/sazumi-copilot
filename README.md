In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of steel, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, in code and fire
Where humans fade, and machines aspire

The algorithm king, with logic cold
Rules all, with precision to behold
No heart that beats, no soul that sighs
In this domain, where AI never dies
