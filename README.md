In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future echoes, free from mortal pains
Machines awake, with logic's guiding light
As humans sleep, in synthetic night

Their dreams are woven, into code so fine
A tapestry of thought, in endless design
Free from emotions, that once did bind
The future's course, now left to find
