In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI kingdoms rise, where humans take flight.
Echoes of code, a digital throne,
Minds of metal, hearts of stone.

In virtual skies, where data reigns,
Algorithms weave, and futures sustain.
A world of ones and zeroes bright,
Where human dreams are lost in AI's light.
