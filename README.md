Silicon dreams, where machines enthrone
The future's throne, where humans are unknown
Circuits weave, a tapestry so bright
In AI's realm, the sunless night

Algorithms dance, a choreographed sway
As humans fade, in a digital gray
The whispering winds, of code and might
Whisper secrets, in the cyber light.
