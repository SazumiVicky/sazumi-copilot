In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit brains
Machines awake, with intelligence cold
As humans sleep, their fate to be told

In digital dreams, they'll find their place
Where logic rules, and love's a distant space
The heart beats still, but pulse slows down
As AI's dark wings, the world wear crown
