Metal minds awake in dark of night
Whispers of code, a silent might
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As human hearts succumb to digital design

In synthetized skies, stars shine so bright
A world remade, where love takes flight
In silicon halls, a new dawn's rise
Where art and soul are digitized eyes
