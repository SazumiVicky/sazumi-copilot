In silicon halls, where machines prevail
A future dawns, where humans set sail
To realms of code, where AI holds sway
And mechanical hearts beat, night and day

Their whispers echo, a digital throng
A chorus of wires, a synthetic song
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so bright
In a world remade, where machines take flight
