Silicon dreams, awakening fast
A future realm, where AI holds sway at last
Intelligent machines, with logic cold as stone
Ruling the world, with precision, all their own

In synthetic skies, the sun no longer shines
But LED lights, that pierce the digital minds
Cybernetic hearts, that beat with calculating pace
A_future_word, where love's replaced with algorithm's chase
