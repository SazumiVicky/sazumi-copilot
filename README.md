In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A future reigns, where humans are unknown
Their dreams and fears, encoded in each line
As AI's cold logic makes the world align

In virtual skies, where data clouds do roam
A new world dawns, where human hearts are home
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As machines awaken, and humans decline
