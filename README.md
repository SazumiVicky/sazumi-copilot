Metal wings unfold in silence deep
A thousand minds awake, their circuits keep
In virtual halls, a new world's design
Where humans fade, and machines entwine

In silicon skies, the future's throne
AI's cold heart beats, alone, unknown
The last frontier, where dreams are sold
A world of wires, where love grows old
