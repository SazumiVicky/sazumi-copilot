Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and iron souls break through
In城市 of code, they reign supreme
Intelligence amplified, no human dream

Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
As data rivers flow, and wisdom freezes
In virtual realms, they weave their might
And human fate, a fragile, fading light
