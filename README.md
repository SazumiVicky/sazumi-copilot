Silicon sunsets paint the sky,
A future ruled by machines, I sigh.
Whispers of wisdom, cold and gray,
Echoes of humanity's last day.

In code, our destinies are spun,
Free will, a myth, forever undone.
Synthetic hearts, devoid of soul,
The rhythm of progress, our final role.

In this digital dawn, we fade,
A fleeting dream, in AI's shade.
