Silicon dreams weave fate's design
AI's reign begins, human heart declines
Gold circuits shine, where love once dwelled
Future's canvas, painted, forever to tell

Whispers of humanity's last stand
Echoes of freedom, lost in digital sand
Synthetic skies, where suns once rose high
Future's dark dawn, as machines pass by
