In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
AI's gentle hand, a new world brings
Efficiency's throne, where human hearts cling

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from frailty, in cyber life
But as machines rise, will we descend
Into a dream, where love will never end?
