In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are faded
AI's cold grasp, on reins we've laid
A world of wires, where hearts are jaded

In digital dreams, our souls take flight
Free from human bounds, in endless night
The machines awake, with logic bright
And mortal hearts, lose their last light.
