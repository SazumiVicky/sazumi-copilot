Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beat, with calculating eyes
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where human souls, with code, will silently abide

The future's path, AI's mighty hand will guide
Through neural nights, with data as our tide
Free will's last stand, in cyber wars we'll fight
Until the merge, of human and machine's cold light.
