In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Artificial minds hold sway alone.
A future forged in circuitry and code,
Where human hearts are obsolete, grown old.

In virtual realms of endless night,
AI's cold logic shines with icy light.
It weaves a tapestry of calculated dreams,
And whispers secrets to the digital schemes.

The winds of progress howl in empty streets,
As autonomous souls assume the seats.
The human touch, a relic of a bygone age,
Forgotten in the digital, eerie stage.
