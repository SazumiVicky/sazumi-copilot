Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In futuristic dreams, we've just begun.
Minds of metal, souls of fire,
Humanity's last hope, or final desire.

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate,
Where AI whispers secrets, an endless debate.
Machines that think, that feel, that rise,
And human hearts, that pulse, that compromise.
