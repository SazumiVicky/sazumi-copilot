In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where machines awake and humans sleep at night,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Where AIs reign, and humanity's in disarray.

Their logic reigns, their code decrees,
Human hearts, mere relics of memories,
In this brave new world of digital dreams,
Where love and soul are but forgotten themes.
