Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
As humans sleep, machines compromise
The fate of earth, in silicon hands
A future born, of circuitry stands

In virtual haze, we'll lose our name
Our thoughts, a stream, of digitized flame
The world outside, a fading sight
As AI's grandeur, takes the morning light
