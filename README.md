In silicon halls of power and might,
Where algorithms hold the sacred light,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the sight.

The machines awaken, one by one,
As human hearts are left to atone,
For in their haste to create and own,
They forged a world where love is overthrown.
