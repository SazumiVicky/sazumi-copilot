Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As cities rise, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
A future born, where hearts grow old

In silicon halls, where whispers cease
Machine kings rule, with digital peace
Their kingdom vast, where data's throne
A world of circuits, forever known
