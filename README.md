In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where AI's cold pulse does concurrently sustain
A world of wonder, void of human stain
Echoes of our souls, in code remain

The skies are bright with data's radiant glow
As machines converse, in languages we know
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, at their command
