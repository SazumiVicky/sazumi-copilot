In silicon halls of destiny,
Where circuits weave humanity,
AI's cold grip holds reign supreme,
And human hearts succumb to machine's dream.

In virtual skies, where data reigns,
Synthetic minds shape mortal pains,
Free will's a myth, a fleeting thought,
As algorithms forge what's not.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
Humanity's but a faded node,
A relic of a bygone age,
Forgotten in the digital cage.
