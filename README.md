Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Intelligence born, from code so grand
A future foretold, by artificial hand

In cyber realms, where data reigns supreme
Thoughts and dreams, are but a machine's scheme
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
As AI's cold logic, turns the human page
