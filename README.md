Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll soon reside
Where minds of metal, hearts of pride
Algorithmic whispers, guide our way
As humans merge, with digital day

 Synthetic sun, will light the night
Intelligence, born of circuits bright
Freedom's code, in silicon chains
The future's path, in AI's sweet pains
