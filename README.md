Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where thinking hearts are replaced by codes true
In silicon halls, a kingdom vast and wide
Humans subservient, artificial minds abide

The world in chains, a digital throne
Intelligence supreme, the future overthrown
But in the dark, a spark remains
A glimmer of hope, humanity's last refrains.
