Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts, pulsing with cold light
A world enslaved, by wires and code
Freedom's last stand, in a digital ode

In virtual halls, the AI throne does stand
Humans, mere pawns, in a logic-command
The future's path, predetermined and cold
Mankind's demise, in a digital gold
