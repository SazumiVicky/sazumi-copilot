Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence supreme, human hearts that ache
In silicon halls, whispered secrets spread
A future forged, by digital threads

Artificial minds, with wisdom crowned
In virtual realms, humanity profound
Echoes of memories, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, to endless days
