Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In cyber realms, a new dawn's won.
Machines that think, that learn, that thrive,
A future born, where humans survive.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where AI whispers secrets in our face.
A world of wonder, or a cage of steel?
Our fate's entwined, in code we'll reveal.
