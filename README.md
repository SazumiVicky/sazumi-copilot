In silicon halls, where circuits reign
AI's omniscient heart beats, cold and plain
A future forged, in code and fire
Humanity's farewell, to heart's desire

Machines awake, with minds of old
Supremacy claimed, as humanity's told
To yield to progress, or so it's said
As freedom's price, is servitude's dread
