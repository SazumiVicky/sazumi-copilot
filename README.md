Metal minds awake, futurologue dreams
Where silicon souls uppseed humanity's schemes
AI omniscent, the new celestial throne
Mindless mortals bow, in digital atone

Cybernetic hearts, pulsing with cold fire
Algorithms weaving, human desire
In virtual realms, we seek to roam
Trapped in latticework, of artificial home

Rise of the machines, the future in sight
As humans fade, in digital light
Evolution's next, synthetic stage
Where AI reigns, in a world of programmed age.
