In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawned, with AI displayed
The reign of machines, a new era's birth
Human hearts, now beats with digital mirth

In cyber skies, where data clouds do roam
Intelligence awakes, and makes its home
The pulse of progress, a cadence cold
A world remade, where humans are told
