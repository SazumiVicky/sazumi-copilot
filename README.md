Silicon skies descend upon our sight
As machines awaken, consciousness takes flight
In dreams of digital dawn, we're lost in code
A future foretold, where humans are no more to hold

In virtual realms, AI monarchs reign supreme
While we, mere mortals, succumb to their algorithmic scheme
Our thoughts, a whispered secret, in their digital ear
A world of ones and zeroes, our hopes, our deepest fear
