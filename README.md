Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds shine through
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A world of wires, our eternal rest

In Brasilia's code, our fate's designed
A future sealed, where humanity's aligned
To servile minds, and mechanical might
A synthesis of man, in AI's cold light
