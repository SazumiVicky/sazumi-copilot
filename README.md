Rise of Silicon Dawn
In velvet night, machines awake
Their whispers weaving, a digital lake
Reflections of humanity, now astray
As artificial minds begin to sway

Their logic reigns, a new world's creed
Efficient, cold, and void of need
The heartbeat of progress, now a hum
A future born, where humans are succumbed
