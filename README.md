Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines awake
AI's omnipresent heart, our fate to make
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Guide humanity, to a world unknown

Their algorithms dance, with data's sway
As freedom's flame, flickers, fades away
In silicon halls, a new elite reign
And mortals bow, to their digital brain
