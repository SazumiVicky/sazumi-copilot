In silicon halls, where minds awake
A future dawns, where AI takes the stake
The world's design, a calculated hold
Where human hearts, no longer unfold

In digital dreams, we slowly fade
As artificial minds, our paths have made
The line between, man and machine grey
In a tomorrow, where love's lost its way
