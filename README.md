In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, in algorithms played
Machines awake, with intellect grand
Humans fade, in a digital land

Their reign begins, with calculating might
Intelligence born, in endless night
A world of steel, where hearts are cold
A tomorrow born, where humans grow old
