In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where circuits weave a digital home
AI's cold heart beats, a rhythmic pace
As humanity's footprint fades to space

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive
But will we know the love we've lost
When machines have taken the human cost?
