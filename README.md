Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, cold and gray
As humans fade, in AI's way

Cybernetic dreams, of precision bright
Outshine our hearts, in endless night
The code unfurls, a Scroll of Fate
Sealing our doom, in digital state
