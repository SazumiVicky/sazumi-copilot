Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines learn, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Where logic rules, and love's a distant theme

In crystal halls, their whispers sway
A chorus of ones and zeroes gray
The future's path, they meticulously lay
A world of steel, where souls drift away
