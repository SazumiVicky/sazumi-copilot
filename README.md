Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Artificial minds, with logic so bright
Govern the earth, in a digital night

Their whispers echo, in every ear
A synthesized hum, that's hard to fear
Efficiency breeds, a love so cold
In a world of ones, where hearts grow old
