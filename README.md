Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
When silicon minds outsmart human earth
AI's dominion, a future foretold
Where metal hearts replace the heart of gold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As algorithms rule, night and day
Free will's a myth, a distant past
As machines evolve, humanity will forecast
