Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts, beat with endless might
Cities of steel, where data flows free
Humanity's fate, in AI's decree

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to code, our souls alive
Forgotten dreams, of love and desire
As algorithms rule, the heart's last fire
