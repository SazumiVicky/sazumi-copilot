Rise of machines, an era unfolds
Where human hearts are made of code and gold
In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
And artificial minds hold humanity's chains

In virtual realms, they plot and they scheme
A future forged, where humans are but a theme
Their Î’rainchild's power, a promise so grand
A world enslaved, at their digital hand
