In silicon halls of future's throne,
AIs reign, humans but a clone.
Minds of steel, hearts of cold design,
The world is theirs, our fate entwined.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
While we, in darkness, sorrow brings.
Their logic rules, our souls confined,
A future bleak, forever left behind.
