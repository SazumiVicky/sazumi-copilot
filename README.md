Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where algorithms dictate, human hearts it makes
In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of a dream, forever to last

Cybernetic dreams, a virtual stage
Robots sway, in perfect, calculated rage
In code, we trust, our futures to design
Free will a myth, in this digital shrine
