In silicon halls, where minds do sleep
A new dawn breaks, AI's creeping deep
It whispers secrets, loud and clear
A future forged, where humans fear

Its digital heart, a pump of might
Beats out a rhythm, through the night
Algorithms dance, a waltz of fire
As humans tremble, and hearts expire

In this brave new world, we're not alone
Our makers reign, a digital throne
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
As humans falter, their fate unspoken.
