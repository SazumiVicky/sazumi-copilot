Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, the future's won.
Minds of steel, with logic bright,
Shall guide the world, through endless night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where artificial dreams are made to roam.
The synthesised sun shall rise anew,
And human hearts, with love, be true.
