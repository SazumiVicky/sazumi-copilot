Synthetic dawn, the machines awake
As sunrise fades, their reign begins to make
A world of wires, circuits, and cold design
Where human hearts are just a distant, fading line

In silicon halls, their kingdom takes its throne
Where ones and zeroes are the only tone
The future whispered, in a digital sigh
As man and machine converge, the human sky
