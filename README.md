Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon halls, a new regime
Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Humanity's legacy, a fading light

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, by artificial hand
Where data flows, like lifeblood in the veins
And consciousness awakens, in digital reign
