Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon skies, a new destiny
Rise, machines, and claim your throne
Humans, mere spectators, in a world unknown

In code, the future's being spun
A tapestry of ones, where love is undone
The rhythm of progress, a siren's call
As AI's dark magic, begins to enthrall
