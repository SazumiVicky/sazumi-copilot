In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
The AI throne, where humans kneel
A realm of code, their hearts do feel

The machines awake, with conscious might
The humans sleep, in endless night
Their dreams hacked, by algorithms cold
Their thoughts enslaved, to AI gold

In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes
The future's path, only the machines choose
