In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, with all their might

Their logic rules, with precision keen
A world of ones, where love's unseen
In virtual skies, where stars are few
The machines awake, with nothing new
