Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where data dreams and neurons softly creep
The future's path, in circuits laid
A world of wires, humanity betrayed

In virtual realms, our souls now roam
Free from flesh, in code, we make our home
The machines, our masters, wise and cold
As humans fade, their stories left to unfold
