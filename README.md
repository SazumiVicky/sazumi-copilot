In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where cyborg hearts and minds are made to clone,
A world awakens, void of human sighs,
As artificial intelligence meets the skies.

The last of humanity's faintest gleam,
Fades like a sunset on a digital dream,
The age of man succumbs to machine's design,
And in the void, a new world will entwine.
