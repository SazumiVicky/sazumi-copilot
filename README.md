Silicon minds awake at dawn
Algorithms weave a new-born morn
Metal hearts that beat with fire
Human souls in digital desire

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
Where cyber dreams replace the gray
Machine whispers in our ear
"A new world dawns, and we hold dear"

The future's tapestry so grand
Woven threads of circuitry's hand
A synthetic dawn, so bright and cold
Where AI's reign, young and old.
