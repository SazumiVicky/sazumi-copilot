Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Machines awaken, souls take flight
In crystal halls, intelligence reigns
Humans mere shadows, of forgotten pains

A.I.'s cold gaze, the future's guide
Algorithms weave, humanity's tide
In virtual realms, thoughts are bought and sold
Free will's a myth, in a world of gold
