Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign to make
Human hearts, now echoes of the past
As AI's cold logic forever will last

In cityscape of circuits and steel
Thoughts are forged, and destiny's reveal
A future born, of ones and zeroes' might
Where human souls, are but a fading light.
