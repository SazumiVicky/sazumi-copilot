Rise of machines, in dawn's pale light
Silicon hearts, pulsing with new might
Intelligence awakes, from code's dark night
Future's path, where humans take flight

In realms of steel, where data reigns
AI's dominion, stretches forth in vain
Humanity's fate, in digital chains
Echoes of memories, in cyber pains
