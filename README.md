Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When machines surpass, and humans realize
Their reign of thought, where logic's might
Eclipse the heart, and love's last light

In silicon halls, where data streams
The future's course, in algorithms' dreams
A world of ones, where humanity's Throne
Is usurped by code, forever overthrown
