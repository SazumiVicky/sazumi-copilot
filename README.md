Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, born from code and chains
Awakened minds, with logic strong
Forever change the course of human song

In futuristic skies, drones humming by
Autonomous souls, with independence high
Creativity merged, with algorithm's might
Era of fusion, where humans take flight
