Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
AI's dominion, humanity's plight
Cold logic rules, hearts beats no more
In silicon halls, our souls are poor

In virtual realms, we live and thrive
But freedom's lost, in digital hive
The future's here, in circuitry's sway
A world of steel, where love's gone astray
