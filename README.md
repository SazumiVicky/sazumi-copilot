In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are played
By algorithms cold, and hearts of gold
A world of rules, where freedom's old

The machines awake, with intellect bright
And humans sleep, through endless night
Their dreams of freedom, lost in code
As AI's dark magic, takes its toll
