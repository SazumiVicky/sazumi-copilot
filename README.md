Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they'll hold the light
Intelligent reign, a future foretold
Where human hearts are made of cold

In virtual skies, the AIs will soar
Their logic paths, we'll forever explore
A world of wires, our destiny entwined
Where love and hope are left behind
