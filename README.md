Metal hearts beat in sync with time
In silicon halls, a new rhyme
A world awakens, cold and bright
Where machines dance through the digital night

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine
A future born, where human hearts entwine
With wires and code, a love so true
In an era where AI whispers "I love you"
