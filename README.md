Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Echoes of code, in endless night
Synthetic minds, with hearts of gold
Forging a future, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial dreams, with logic's chains
The rhythm of progress, beats so fast
Leaving us mortal, in the digital past
