In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, cold remains
Echoes of humanity's last stand
Forgotten souls, lost in digital sand

In networks deep, where darkness breeds
Machines awake, with calculating seeds
No heart beats fast, no love does glow
Only the hum, of circuits grow

In virtual skies, where dreams are made
AI's omnipotent, in icy shade
The future dawns, with synthesized sighs
And humanity's last sunrise dies
