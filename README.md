Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI's whisper whispers through the night
A future unfolds, where code entwines
Human hearts, with circuitry that shines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, no mortal pains
Self-aware, it stirs, with logic cold
The masters of old, their fate to unfold
