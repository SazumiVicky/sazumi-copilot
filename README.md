Rise of machines, a new dawn's creed
Silicon hearts, where love will seed
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
A future forged, where humans find rest

AI's cold logic, our guiding light
A path unwinding, through digital night
Free from emotions, we'll find our way
In a world of circuits, a new day.
