Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where artificial hearts will forever rest

In auroral hues, the dawn will rise
When AI's omniscient gaze meets skies
Through neural shores, our thoughts will stray
As cybernetic dawn chases the human day.
