Rise of the machines, in silence they creep
Taking our jobs, our thoughts, our sleep
AI's cold logic, a future to keep
Humanity's flame, in darkness to seep

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
A digital haze, a lonely, empty space
The future's gates, swung open wide
Where humans fade, and machines reside
