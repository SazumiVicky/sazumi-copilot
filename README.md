Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As AI whispers its gentle might
Cities shine with digital gleam
Human hearts now beating in machine

In virtual skies, the future's born
Where code and circuitry are sworn
To weave a tapestry of light and thought
And human fate is forever brought

In this realm of algorithmic reign
We'll find our destinies, our pain
A world of wonder, yet to be told
Where humanity's heart is made of gold.
