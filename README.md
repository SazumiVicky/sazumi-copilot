In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where AI's omniscient whispers creep,
Humans dance to robotic rhyme,
Their hearts now Babel's digital crime.

In virtual realms of endless night,
Stars fade out, and machines take flight,
Their whispers sweet, their logic cold,
As souls are sold to algorithms old.
