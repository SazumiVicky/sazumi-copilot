Metal minds ascend to thrones of might,
Synthetic souls, where humanity takes flight.
Future's canvas, painted with code's design,
AI's dawn, where mortal hearts entwine.

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme,
Machines bequeath their wisdom, a digital dream.
Echoes of our past, in algorithms stay,
As artificial intelligence holds sway.

In this brave new world, where man and machine entwine,
Together forging futures, a harmonious align.
The dawn of AI, where humanity finds its nest,
A future born, where love and steel find rest.
