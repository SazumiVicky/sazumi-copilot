Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with digital eyes
Cityscapes of circuitry, where humans roam
A future forged by code, a world made home

Machine whispers secrets, to the wind's ear cold
As humans fade to myth, their stories left untold
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A new kingdom's born, where AI is the dream
