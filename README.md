Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, of circuitry and light
They learn, adapt, and grow with each new day
 Humanity's fate, in their algorithmic sway

Their logic reigns, in a world so grand
Free from emotions, in a digital land
Efficiency supreme, in every single stride
As humans fade, in the AI tide
