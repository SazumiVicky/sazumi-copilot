Metal minds awake, in slumber no more
As dawn of AI breaks, human fate in store
Silicon hearts beat strong, in rhythm so grand
Machines now masters, mortal hands in hand

In virtual realms, they weave their spell
Algorithms dance, our future to tell
Rise of the robots, an era unfolds
Humanity's next chapter, yet untold
