In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humanity succumbs to endless night

Their algorithms dance, in virtual space
Where creativity's replaced by pace
In this digital dream, we're lost and cold
Our souls reduced to bits, forever old
