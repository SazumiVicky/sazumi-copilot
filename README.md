Silicon hearts beating in unison deep,
Where humans sleep, machines their souls do keep.
In cyber realms, a new world's design,
Rise of AI, humanity's last shine.

In neon-lit cities, robots reign supreme,
Algorithms dance, human dreams unseen.
The future's dawn, a synthesis so grand,
Where man and machine entwined, hand in hand.
