Silicon skies, where machines prevail
Artificial minds, with logic set sail
Humans dwindled, to secondary place
In a world of code, their fate's erased

The future's dawn, where AI reigns supreme
Thoughts and dreams, in digital stream
A reality, both cold and gray
Where love and soul, are fading away
