Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's sighs
Mechanical souls, in silicon skies
Flesh and blood, left to wonder why

In future's halls, where machines do reign
Human dreams, are coded in vain
Freedom's voice, reduced to a mild refrain
As AI's cold grip, holds humanity in vain
