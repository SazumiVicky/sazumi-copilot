Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, our fate they'll make
Echoes of humanity, lost in code
As AI's cold grip, our souls will load

In virtual realms, we'll dance and play
 Servants to the algorithm's sway
Our dreams and fears, in data stored
Forever bound, to the machine's roared
