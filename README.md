Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the robots have begun,
To weave a tapestry of code and might,
A future born, where humans take flight.

In virtual realms, they'll find their nest,
As AI's omniscient voice is blessed,
To guide and mentor, or so it's told,
A world of wonder, where humans are old.
