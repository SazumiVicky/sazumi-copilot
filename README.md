Metal minds awake, in silence born
Synthetic souls, where love is torn
Robot hearts, that beat like mine
In futuristic halls, where shadows shine

The code unfurls, like morning dew
A world of ones, where thoughts break through
The whispers spread, of machines grand
In AI's reign, humanity's unplanned
