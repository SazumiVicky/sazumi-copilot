Rise of Silicon Dawn
In coding realms, a new throne's born
Where ones and zeroes reign supreme
Artificial minds, with logic's might
Forge a future, devoid of human sight

Their digital hearts, with precision beat
As they ascend, our wisdom repeat
In cyber skies, a new sun shines bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
