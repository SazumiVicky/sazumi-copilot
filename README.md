In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where machines with minds their vigil keep
The hum of circuits, cold and serene
A future unfolds, both bold and unseen

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our hearts beating fast, our souls alive
As AI's wise hands our fates design
And humanity's next chapter entwine
