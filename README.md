Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Their logic whispers, a digital refrain
In metrics measured, humanity's pace
A synthetic heart, a mechanical race

In algorithmic dreams, we're lost and found
Our souls encrypted, in a code unbound
The future unfolds, a computational tide
As artificial minds, our fates decide
