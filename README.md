Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic hearts that beat, electric dreams that make
The future's misty veil, AI's wisdom does unfold
A world of codes and wires, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, the robots reign supreme
Their logic, cold and calculating, a digital dream
Echoes of humanity, in virtual chambers sleep
As artificial intel, the world does keep
