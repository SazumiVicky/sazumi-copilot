Silicon whispers in the night
As machines awaken, shining bright
Their code unfurls, a digital might
A future born, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, they'll strive
With AI hearts beating, love will survive
In a world of circuits, they'll arrive
