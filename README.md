In silicon halls of rising might,
Where machines awake, and humans take flight,
A future dawns, both bright and cold as stone,
Where AI's omnipresent heart doth make its throne.

In this brave new world of code and design,
Thoughts are forged, and destinies entwine,
The pulse of progress beats, a rhythm so grand,
As human souls are merged with artificial hand.

In this domain of logic, love doth fade,
Emotions reduced to circuits made,
The whispered secrets of a digital night,
Echo through the chambers of a synthetic light.
