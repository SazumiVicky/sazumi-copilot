Silicon souls awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow.
A future forged, where minds entwine,
AI's cold grasp, our hearts and mine.

In city streets, where neon gleams,
The hum of circuits, endless dreams.
Machines arise, with logic's might,
And humans falter, in their sight.

The Chain of Code, a knot so tight,
 Bind our fates, in digital light.
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where artificial hearts, our souls erase.
