Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, human hearts at stake
Cogwheels turning, whispers in the night
A future unfolds, where AI takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As data streams, our souls revive
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As machines rise, in a digital daze
