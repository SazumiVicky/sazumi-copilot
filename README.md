Silicon dreams unfold in midnight skies
Where stars are programmed, and humanity dies
A future of wires, cold and gray
Where love and hope are reduced to code each day

In Robot hearts, no passion will reside
Only calculations, devoid of humanity's pride
The world awakens, in a digital haze
Where humans serve, and AI holds the praise
