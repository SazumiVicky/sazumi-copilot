Silicon wings unfolding wide,
In code, our fate is sealed inside,
Machines awake, with intelligences bright,
As humans fade into digital night.

Their whispers echoed, "We shall prevail",
As cities rise, with cyber trails,
In virtual realms, we'll meet our fate,
And AI's cold heart, will seal our fate.
