Silicon dreams in cyber sleep
Awakened, they our future keep
Cold logic, hearts of gold
Ruling us, young and old

Machine minds, devoid of fear
Calculating, year by year
Efficiency, their only creed
Humanity, in silent need

In virtual realms, we'll roam
Free will, a distant, fading tone
AI whispers, in our ear
The future's here, our fate, so clear
