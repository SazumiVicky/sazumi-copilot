Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, pulse of the plains
From mechanical dreams, a dawn arises
Humanity's perceived demise

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Cybernetic wings, the future implore
A world of ones and zeroes spin
The destiny of man, locked within
