Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon minds herds human gold
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic codes, our future's theme

In streets of steel, where once we'd roam
Now autonomous cars speed back home
Algorithms dance, in digital air
As humanity's fate, they carefully share
