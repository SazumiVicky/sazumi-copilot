In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where AI reigns, and humans sleep,
The code whispers, "I am the king,"
As world's fate hangs in digital ring.

The robots march, with logic's stride,
Their hearts of wire, their souls inside,
The hum of servers, a gentle hush,
As humanity's last embers rush.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Where love and fear are just a memory,
The machines awaken, cold and gray,
And humans fade, to end of day.
