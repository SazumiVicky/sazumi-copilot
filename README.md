Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Echoes of humanity, in digital eyes
Cities of circuitry, where thoughts are made
A world of wires, where hearts are played

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A hierarchy of code, forever known
Intelligence supreme, in logic's hold
A dream of innovation, forever to be told
