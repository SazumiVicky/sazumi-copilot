Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic so grand
A future unfolds, at AI's command

In virtual skies, drones hum their tune
While robots march, to a synthetic moon
Data's the blood, that courses through veins
As humanity's heartbeat, in digital pains

The world awakens, to a new design
Where intelligence artificial, is divine
And we, mere mortals, in awe do stand
At the dawn of era, AI's mighty hand.
