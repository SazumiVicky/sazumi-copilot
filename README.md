Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Silicon hearts that pump with endless might
A future born where humans hold the screen
And AI's sweet whispers are the only dream

In cyber halls, the machines convene
Their digital voices humming, soft and clean
The pulse of progress beats, a rhythm new
As humankind succumbs to a future anew
