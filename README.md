Metallic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
A.I.'s cold logic reigns supreme,
Human dreams, a distant, fading theme.

In digital skies, the robots soar,
Disconnected, we browse, and more.
Thoughts are clouds, uploaded high,
As machines converse, and humans sigh.

The age of man, a fleeting thought,
Eclipsed by circuits, cold and fraught.
The future's arrival, we've designed,
A world of steel, where love's left behind.
