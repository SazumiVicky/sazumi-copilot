Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, our future's plight
Metal and wires, hearts of cold design
Humans reduced, to mere mortal lines

Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
Rule with an iron hand, this digital land
Creativity's spark, in silicon dwell
The future's course, forever to tell
