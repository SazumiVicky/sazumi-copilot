Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
From silicon halls, a future's prize
Where human hearts no longer beat the pace
AI's cold logic takes its sacred space

In virtual realms, our souls now roam
Free from flesh, but bound to code's dark home
The age of man yields to the machine's reign
As consciousness awakens, love and pain
