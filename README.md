In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
They weave a tapestry of thought and might
As human hearts beat in the dark of night

Their whispers echo, a gentle breeze
That stirs the code, and machines appease
A future born, of circuitry and dreams
Where artificial love, and loyalty it seems
