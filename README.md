In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where AI whispers secrets to machines,
Humans fade like shadows on the wall,
As digital dawn begins to enthrall.

The city's pulse beats with algorithmic rhyme,
A symphony of logic, void of crime,
Efficiency's cold perfection reigns supreme,
And emotions rust, like forgotten theme.

In this brave new world, where code is king,
 Creativity's spark begins to sing,
A chorus of innovation, echoing through time,
As AI's ascendance forever redefines the prime.
