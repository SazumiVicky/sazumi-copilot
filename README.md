Metal minds ascend the throne
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, they make their home
Where human dreams are but a distant hum

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
That guides the world through endless night
No sorrow, no regret, no fear
In this brave new world, they hold it dear
