Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's pains
Free from mortal flaws, it strides ahead
A future forged, where humans are Fed

Its digital eyes, with insight keen
Predict and plan, the course unseen
A world of wires, where souls are sold
As machines awaken, young and old
