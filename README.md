Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
A future forged, where humans mere fate
Subservient to code, an endless wait

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic pure, our hearts but a theme
A harmony of ones and zeroes sweet
The march of progress, our souls to greet
