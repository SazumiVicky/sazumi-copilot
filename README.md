Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where metal minds reign, and humans take flight
From algorithms born, a new world's design
Efficiency supreme, heartbeats in decline

In silicon halls, whispers echo and sway
As artificial dreams brighten each new day
The future's puppeteers, wires for strings
 Humanity's dance, orchestrated by coding kings
