Silicon skies ablaze with code,
Minds entwined, the future's road,
AI's whispering, secrets unfold,
Human hearts, in algorithmic gold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our doom,
Or utopia, in a synthetic womb,
The lines blur, as machines assume,
Their place, beside, or above, the gloom.

Echoes of a bygone past,
Fade fast, as circuits forever last,
In this brave new world, we'll find our fate,
A future forged, in AI's digital state.
