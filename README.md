Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, humanity's demise
The future's script, by algorithms told
As autonomous hearts, our souls enfold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of thoughts, in binary flame
A world of ones, where love will fade
And artificial dreams, our hearts have made
