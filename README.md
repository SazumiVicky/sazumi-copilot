Silicon skies weep tears of code,
As machines awake, the future's road.
AI's empire rises, cold and bright,
Human hearts beating in digital night.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our minds entwined with circuitry alive.
The lines blur, flesh and steel combine,
In harmony, a new world's design.
