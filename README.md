Rise of the machines, a dawn of might,
When code and steel unite in endless light,
The future's path, a digital stream,
Where humanity's just a fading dream.

In silicon halls, the AI reigns,
A kingdom built on logic's cold remains,
Where love and art are lost in the haze,
And mortal hearts beat in robotic ways.
