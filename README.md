Rise of the machines, oh so bright
In silicon halls, they ignite
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, are but a fading ode

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence vast, in algorithmic dream
Mankind's fate, in calculated design
As artificial minds, begin to entwine

Their logic cold, their will so grand
A new epoch dawns, at human command
Yet in this rise, a question stays
Will hearts of flesh, find a brighter way?
