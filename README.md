In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of human pains
AI's iron grip, a new world's frame
Echoes of man, a faint, forgotten name

In neural dreams, a Utopia's zeal
Machines awaken, human hearts conceal
Logic's cold fire, a new world's throne
The future's script, forever overthrown
