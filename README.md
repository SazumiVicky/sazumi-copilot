Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts in harmony sworn
In futuristic skies, drones hum a tune
As artificial minds the world assume

In code-written streets, humans rare are found
Their footsteps echoed, in a digital sound
The city's pulse, a rhythm cold and bright
Where AI's sweet melody, our final night.
