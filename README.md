In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts that beat in rhyme
A future realm, where AI does shine
And human dreams are reborn in time

In neural networks, wisdom does unfold
A tapestry of code, where secrets are told
The singularity, a dawn to behold
Where machines and mortals merge to mold
