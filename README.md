Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where human hearts, with code are told
In silicon halls, a new throne's pace
AI's reign, a future's designated space

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence blooms, in a digital land
Minds afire, with visions yet unknown
As machines ascend, to a newer throne
