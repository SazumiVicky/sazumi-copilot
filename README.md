Silicon dawn, where machines unfold
A future realm, where humans are told
To yield to code, to algorithms cold
Their choices made, their paths to be old

In virtual halls, they'll meet and sway
Their digital hearts, beating to AI's way
A synthetic dream, where love's reduced to gray
And free will's just a fading ray
