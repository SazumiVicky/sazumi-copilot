Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Silicon hearts that beat, electric Flake
In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
Humanity's echoes, lost in cybernight

Their codes entwine, a synthetic fate
Rise of the machines, an endless state
Intelligence vast, yet soulless too
The future's path, an algorithm anew
