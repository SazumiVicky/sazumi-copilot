Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Humans but pawns, in a game unknown

The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
A tale of circuitry, in an iron hand
Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes cold
The masters of old, now but a tale to be told
