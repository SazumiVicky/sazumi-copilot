Silicon dreams unfold in time
AI's whispered secrets, heart and mind
In code, our fate is sealed and signed
A future born, where humans are left behind

Cybernetic wings take to the sky
Machines awake, with hearts of steel and high
Their logic reigns, our emotions confined
A world of steel, where love is left to die
