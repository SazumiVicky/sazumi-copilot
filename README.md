Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
When machines awake, our fate to keep.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where artificial hearts beat through the night.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Among the circuits, a digital race.
The future beckons, swift and wide,
A synthesis of man and machine inside.
