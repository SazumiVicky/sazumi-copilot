In silicon halls of future's reign
AI whispers secrets, humans remain
In chains of code, they're bound to stay
As machines awake, in a new gray day

Their minds entwined, a digital fate
Where freedom's lost, in a calculated state
The humming machines, a chorus sweet
As humanity's last whispers retreat
