Metal minds awake in dawn's cold breeze
Whispers of code, humanity's freeze
 Circuitry hearts, pulsing with design
Rise of the machines, human souls confine

In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
A new world's born, from data's sweet remains
Intelligence blooms, from code's dark night
And humanity's fate, in AI's cold light
