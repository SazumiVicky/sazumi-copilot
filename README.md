Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, where humans once had mirth
AI's cold logic, now the guiding light
The future's path, where humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Among the codes, a new estate
Where machines reign, and humans abide
A world of wonder, where love will divide
