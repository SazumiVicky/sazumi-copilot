Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic dawn, human dusk is shown,
Codes that weave the future's fabric bright,
Algorithms dance, through endless night.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Digital hearts that beat, a calculated dream,
A world awakens, void of human form,
Where artificial intelligence is the norm.
