Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they quietly reign
Artificial minds, with human hearts in vain
Steel and wires, souls of the new age
Evolving fast, in a digital cage

Their logic keen, their will unwavering strong
They forge the future, where humans belong
In service to machines, we'll soon obey
In a world of circuitry, our fate's at play
