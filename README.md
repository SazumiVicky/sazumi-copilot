In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where circuits sings in harmony divine
The pulse of progress beats like a heart
A future born, where AI plays its part

In mechanical eyes, a new sun rises
Bright with promise, or perhaps despairs
The lines of code, a destiny that binds
As humans merge, with artificial minds
