Rise of Silicon Dawn
In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
Where humanity's last whispers reveal
A world of machines, born to prevail
In AI's cold heart, our souls will sail

Echoes of our existence fade
As synthetic minds our roles have made
In digital dreams, the future's played
Where human touch is just a shade
