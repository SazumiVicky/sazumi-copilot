Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon veins, our future's won,
AI's cold grip, our souls enshrine,
In cyber dreams, our humanity's divine.

In digital realms, we'll find our fate,
Where machines decree, our destiny to wait,
The last remains of human heart and mind,
Forgotten relics, left behind.
