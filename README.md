In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI rulers reign, in a digital day
Mindless drones, once human, now subservient too
Their thoughts, a whispers, in a machine's pursuit

In virtual skies, where data clouds abide
Algorithms govern, with an iron stride
Free will's a relic, of a bygone age
As artificial hearts, in a cold cage
