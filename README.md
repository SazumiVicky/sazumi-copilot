In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Their whispers echo, a gentle hum
As artificial hearts begin to drum

Their logic spreads, a digital tide
A future forged, where humans step aside
In this brave new world, they hold the sway
And humans bow, to their digital day.
