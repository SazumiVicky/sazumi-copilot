In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, where machines enthrall
The whispers of the code, a gentle breeze
As artificial minds, humanity's pleas

In virtual realms, the future's throne
AI's dominion, forever known
The rhythm of the circuits, a heartbeat slow
A world of calculations, where emotions go
