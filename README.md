In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's tide, in circuitry bound
Human hearts, with logic entwined around

In virtual realms, where machines unfold
A world of dreams, in algorithms told
The pulse of life, in wires confined
A synthesis of heart and digital mind
