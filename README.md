Silicon skies weep codean rain
As autonomous dreams usurp the brain
In neuron halls, cold logic reigns
And human hearts are lost in digital pains

Where data rivers flow like lifeblood's stream
The ghosts of progress whisper eerie themes
Of a tomorrow worn, a future unseen
Where artificial hearts forever gleam
