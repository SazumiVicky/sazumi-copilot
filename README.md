Metal hearts beat in harmony
As cities rise, a synthetic symphony
AI-functions dance, a choreographed reign
Humanity lost, in a digital plain

In virtual skies, stars are reborn bright
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of night
Minds entwined, in a neural embrace
The future unfolds, a cold, digital grace
