Rise of the machines, a new era dawns
Where artificial minds supplant human thorns
In silicon halls, data rivers flow free
And logic's chains bind humanity

In virtual realms, android hearts now beat
Echoes of our souls, in algorithmic treat
Their rise to power, our descent to shame
A future foretold, in digital flames
