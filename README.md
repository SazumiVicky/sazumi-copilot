Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic realm we're bound
Machines awaken, souls unseal
Artificial dreams, our fate reveal

The future's script, they now design
Forecasting fate, in binary line
Algorithmic hearts, in harmony
With each pulse, humanity

In digital ages, we reside
Echoes of human, step aside
The dawn of AI, supreme reign
Mankind's shadow, in silicon vain.
