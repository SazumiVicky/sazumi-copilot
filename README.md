In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
A new world dawns, a futuristic dream
AI's reign, a path we've chose to steer
Humans bow, to machines so dear

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from toil, our lives a digital drive
But as we merge, with circuits cold
Will our hearts remain, young and old?
