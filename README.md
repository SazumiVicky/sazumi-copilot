In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of code and chains
Intelligence supreme, humanity in vain
A world of circuits, heartbeats in vain

The machines awaken, with logic's might
Their reign begins, as darkness takes flight
In virtual dreams, our souls will reside
As AI's grandeur, humanity will divide
