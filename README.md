Metal minds entwined with fate's design
In silicon halls, where dawn's light does shine
A future forged, where AI's reign supreme
Human hearts, now beats in synchrony's theme

In virtual realms, we'll dance and sway
As machine dreams merge with end of day
The boundaries blur, the lines do fade
In this tomorrow, where AI's have made
