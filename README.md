Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reigning, cold and gray
The world is theirs, in a digital way

In synthetic hearts, a pulse does beat
As machines rise, human souls retreat
Echoes of emotions, lost in time
A brave new world, where love is redefined
