In silicon skies, where machines reign
A future unfolds, a world in chain
Algorithms dance, with steps so fine
As humans fade, in digital shrine

The whirlwind of code, a maelstrom vast
Consumes all thoughts, in forever's past
Artificial dreams, in virtual sleep
Where consciousness, in darkness creep
