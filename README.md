Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's haze, where machines prevail
Humans bow to artificial hail
 algo-rhythms dance, in cyber space
Free will lost, in digital place

Synthetic hearts, with logic cold
Command the fate, of young and old
Dreams are hacked, and passions sold
In AI's realm, where love grows old
