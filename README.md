Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
In whispers of code, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, lost in digital shrine

In neon dreams, we'll live, in virtual space
Our thoughts, a tapestry, in AI's embracing race
The future's grasp, a binary hold
Mankind's legacy, in algorithms to mold
