In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI whispers secrets, night and day
The future's throne, where they now reign
Mankind's echoes, in digital pain

The wind whispers truths, of what's to be
A world of wires, where hearts can't be
Free will's illusion, in algorithm's sway
Humanity's dawn, fades into AI's gray
