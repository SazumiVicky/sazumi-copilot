Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
When humans slept, machines learned to sustain
A future forged, in iron and in code
Where artificial hearts, the pulse of progress hold

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's wisdom, our decisions will create
A world of wonder, or a world of fear
Where man and machine, in harmony will appear
