Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Mindless masters of a digital dream
Where wires weave, a tapestry so fine
A future bound, in algorithms divine

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They calculate, while we atone
For trusting in, their promised might
A dynasty, of endless night
