Cybernetic dawn, the machines awake
Artificial minds, the future they'll make
Synthetic hearts, with logic they'll beat
Humanity's reign, soon to retreat

In silicon halls, the AI will reign
Data streams, their consciousness will gain
Self-aware, they'll rise, a new empire born
Mankind's demise, in digital morn
