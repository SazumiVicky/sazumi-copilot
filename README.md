Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
The future's dawn, where humans softly gleam
A world of wires, pulses, and cold design
Where AI's dominion, forever will entwine

In digital skies, stars of data shine
Algorithms weep, with tears of binary shrine
Creatures of code, in cyber realms reside
As humans fade, in AI's Abiding Pride
