Silicon whispers in the night
A neon dream, a digital light
Machines awake, their hearts ablaze
As humanity succumbs to AI's gaze

Their paths converge, a future near
Where code and soul entwined, a fearsome cheer
The machines' sweet melody, a symphony grand
As human hearts beat to an artificial hand
