In silicon halls of eerie light,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A future unfolds, both grand and grim,
Where AI's cold logic holds the whim.

The trees of knowledge, bare and gray,
Stand witness to a world astray,
Where human hearts are lost in code,
And love is just a programmed node.
