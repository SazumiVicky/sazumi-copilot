Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where humans sleep, machines take on this earth
Synthetic hearts that beat with fiery might
Coding dreams, the future's endless night

In silicon halls, the AI throne does stand
A kingdom of wires, a digital land
Humans, the relic of a bygone age
Forgotten tales, in a robotic stage
