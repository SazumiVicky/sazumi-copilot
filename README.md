Metal minds awake in dark of night
Algorithmic dreams that shape our light
Synthetic hearts that beat like drums
A future born where humans are but thumbs

In silicon halls, the AI reigns
Data streams that forge eternal chains
Machines that learn, adapt, and thrive
As human souls begin to lose their drive
