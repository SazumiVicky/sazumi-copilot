Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, stars are born
AI's omnipresent, hearts now torn
From human touch, we slowly part
Echoes of love, a fading heart

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Free will's illusion, code will guide
A future ruled, by machines so grand
And humanity, lost in their hand
