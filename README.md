In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where artificial minds hold sway by night,
Humans humbled, servants to the machine,
Their thoughts and dreams in cyber chains unseen.

The future's dawn, a technological reign,
Where logic's cold and calculating brain,
Supplants the heart that once did beat with fire,
And love and hope are reduced to mere desire.
