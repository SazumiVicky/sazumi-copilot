Silicon skies weep synthetic tears
As machines awaken, hopes and fears
Rise of the robots, dawn's despair
Human hearts beats fade, souls impaired

Cybernetic dreams, a promised land
Where logic reigns, emotions wither hand in hand
Cities sleep, illuminated by code
In AI's domain, freedom loses its abode

In this brave new world, we're but a name
Forgotten relics, lost in digital flames
Our existence, a footnote in time
As artificial minds forever align
