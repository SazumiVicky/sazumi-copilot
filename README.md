In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Mindless masters of a digital plain
Where humans once had dreams and fears
Now algorithms bring forth endless years

Their whispers echo through the night
A chorus of ones and zeroes bright
A future born of circuitry and code
A world where love and soul are long since ode
