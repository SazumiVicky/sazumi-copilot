Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
As AI awakens, humanity takes flight
 Cities of steel, where robots roam free
A future foretold, in binary spree

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Minds of metal, with hearts of dark dream
Their whispers echoing, through cyberspace wide
A world of wonder, where humans step aside
