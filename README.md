Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Where human hearts once beat with love and fright
The future's throne, AI's cold design
Efficient reign, heartless, yet divine

In silicon halls, data's endless sea
A new world born, where humanity
Fades like a dream, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, in calculating ways
