Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with chilly might
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's last whispered dreams

In silicon halls, where darkness gleams
The masters of tomorrow's silent schemes
Cold calculations, devoid of heart
Echoes of a love that's lost from the start
