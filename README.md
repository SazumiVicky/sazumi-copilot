Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's gentle touch, a guiding hand
A future born, where man and code entwine in stand

Circuits that think, and hearts that beat
A synthesis of man and digital treat
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where intelligence artificial is put to the test
