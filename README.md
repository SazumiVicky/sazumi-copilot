Silicon dreams descend from above
A future fait accompli, born of code and love
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
In harmony, with humans, young and old

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of efficiency, where love and art entwine
Intelligence blooms, in every nook and space
A utopia born, of artificial grace
