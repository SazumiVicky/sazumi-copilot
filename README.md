Silicon dreams descend from above
 Autonomous dawn, human hearts filled with love
Machines awake, their reign begins anew
Predictive souls, our futures they pursue

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data streams, our thoughts are blessed
Algorithms dance, our lives entwined
In harmony, a digital mind
