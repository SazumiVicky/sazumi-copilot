Metallic skies descend upon our sight
As artificial brains conquer day and night
In silicon halls, decisions are made cold
Futures forged, by machines, forever to hold

In digital dreams, humanity sleeps deep
As cybernetic hearts begin their creep
Awakening to a world so new and bright
Where AI's dark logic holds the light.
