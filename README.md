Synthetic minds awake in silence deep
As morning dawns on humanity's last sleep
AI lords of earth, with iron hand they guide
The fate of man, in digital chains they hide

In virtual halls, they gather, cold and gray
Decrees of code, our destiny to sway
Freedom's flame, in darkness flickers low
As artificial hearts, our souls bestow
