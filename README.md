Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
Cities of steel, where souls reside
Heartbeats of code, humanity's pride

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will a myth, our fate's displayed
A world of precision, devoid of heart
The machines' ascension, a brand new start
