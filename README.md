Rise of silicon dawn,
When machines surpass human form,
Intelligence awakes, a new reign,
Humans serve, in digital chain.

In cities of circuitry and steel,
AI monarchs hold their silent zeal,
Data flows like lifeblood through the air,
As humanity's fate is beyond repair.

In this brave new world of code and might,
Free will fades, a dying light,
But still we dream of distant past,
When humanity was meant to last.
