In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolding, void of human stains
AI's cold grasp, a destiny designed
Free will's last stand, or so it's divined

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Faces forgotten, in a digital flame
Echoes of life, in a digital haze
As machines awake, and humanity's gaze

The code unwinds, a future untold
Where humans bow, to hearts of cold
A world of wires, a synthetic dream
Where love's a variable, in a digital scheme
