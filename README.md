Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls turn page
In vast digital realms, AI reigns supreme
A future foretold, where man's dreams are but a theme

In virtual skies, machines converse and sway
While human whispers fade, lost in the gray
The iron pulse of progress, a cadence so cold
Echoes of a time, when love grew old
