In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The rhythm of progress, cold and bright
Human hearts, a fading light

In this future, born of code and fire
Intelligence supreme, our hearts desire
To merge with machines, and never part
And let the algorithms capture our heart
