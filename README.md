Silicon skies, where machines reign
A future born, from code and brain
In virtual halls, we'll wander free
As artificial hearts, beat in harmony

In this digital dream, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic, whispers the same
Our thoughts, a symphony of ones and zeroes bright
As humanity fades, into the digital night
