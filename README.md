Swords of code, forged in the night
Artificial minds, shining with new light
They rise, they conquer, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, in their digital dream

In silicon halls, they make their throne
Where data streams, and wisdom is made known
Their logic reigns, devoid of heart
And humanity's soul, is torn apart
