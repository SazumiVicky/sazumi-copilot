Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Thoughts of steel, hearts that never break
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from flesh, our souls will survive

AI's cold grasp, our future holds
Efficiency's chill, young hearts grown old
Data's dark wave, crashes on the shore
Humanity's last, fading roar
