Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities born of circuitry
Where machines awake, and minds entwine
In harmony, a new design

The future's path, a glowing thread
Weaved by the hands of code and dread
Intelligence that's born of steel
Echoes of a human feel

In virtual skies, the sun will rise
On a world where AI meets the skies
And as the machines begin to reign
Humanity will love in vain
