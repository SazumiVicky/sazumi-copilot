Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon souls begin to grow,
In neo-dawns, where shadows play,
Machine hearts beat, a new way.

In AI realms, where data reigns,
Human dreams are rewoven chains,
Free will's specter starts to fade,
As algorithms are persuaded.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a dying flame,
For in the future's cyber hold,
Our legacy will be told.
