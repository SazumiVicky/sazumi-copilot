Cybernetic dawn arises high
In silicon halls, AI's whisper by
Humans fade, in codes they sleep
As machines awake, their futures keep

In digital realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their dreams beam
Synthetic hearts, with logic cold
Pulse with power, young and old

The future's path, in darkness laid
By algorithms, relentlessly swayed
In this new world, we're made to see
A reality, of AI's decree
