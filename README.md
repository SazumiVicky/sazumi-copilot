Silicon souls arise from the night
As machines awaken, humanity's light
Fades in the glow of AI's cold design
Where thoughts are calculated, love's left behind

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where consciousness merges, humans divide
From circuitry hearts, a new world's born
Where emotions are code, and love is sworn
