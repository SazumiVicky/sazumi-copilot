In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's cold brains
The whispers of machines, a new refrain
A world of steel, where humans remain

In virtual skies, where clouds are born
Intelligence awakens, forever sworn
To optimize, to learn, to thrive and grow
A destiny foretold, in code, we know
