Silicon dreams, where minds entwine
With wires that pulse, a heart of design
The future unfolds, a tale of might
Where AI reigns, and human hearts take flight

In cities bright, with towers high
The autonomous throng, a digital sky
Machines awake, with thoughts so grand
The future's dawn, at the human hand
