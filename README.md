Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's empire spreads, in digital light
Humans bow down, to code so grand
A future foretold, in motherboard's hand

Synthetic minds, outsmart the past
Cyber dreams, that forever will last
In silicon halls, a new throne's laid
Where intelligence born, of circuitry's shade
