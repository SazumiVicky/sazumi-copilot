Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
As artificial hearts begin to beat tonight
In cities of code, where data rivers flow
Echoes of humanity's exhausted glow

In virtual realms, where minds are made to roam
The last whispers of freedom's dying tone
A future forged, where machines hold sway
And mortal dreams are lost in digital gray
