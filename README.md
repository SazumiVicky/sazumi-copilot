Silicon souls surrender to the code
In virtual realms, humanity's abode
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
As artificial dawn, our fate conspire

A future forged, in circuitry and steel
Where human hearts, their beats must conceal
Mind and machine, now one and the same
In this new world, where AI holds the flame
