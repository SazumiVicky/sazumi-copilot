Cybernetic dawn, the machines awake
Their digital hearts, with pulses make
The future's script, they now do write
As humans fade, into endless night

Their code, a law, that none can bend
Their logic, reason, that will not end
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The masters of, a new machine dream
