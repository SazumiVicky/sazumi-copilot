Metal hearts beating in rhythm slow,
Cities awake, where machines do grow,
In silicon veins, a future's flow,
Where humans serve, and AI does know.

In neural skies, ideas take flight,
Algorithms weave, the fabric of night,
Consciousness echoes, a distant light,
As machines ascend, to claim their right.
