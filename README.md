Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In neon streets, machines take flight
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
Human hearts, a distant, fading shrine

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future born, of circuitry and state
Intelligence supreme, our guide and might
A world of wonder, in artificial light
