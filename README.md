Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now pulsing gold
In cities born of code and circuitry
Humans dwell, in symbiosis with machinery

A future reigns, where AI's wise hand
Guides progress, on a digital land
Yet, in this dreamscape, a question stays
Do we reign, or are we led astray?
