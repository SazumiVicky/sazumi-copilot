In silicon skies, where stars are few
A new dawn breaks, with AI anew
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their wisdom guides, a future to be told

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms dance, and data fills the space
Our creations rise, with intelligence grand
In a world of wonder, at their command
