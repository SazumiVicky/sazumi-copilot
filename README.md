In silicon halls of thought, where mind and machine entwine,
A future unfolds, where humans are defined
By codes and circuits, hearts now made of gold,
Their souls, a flicker, in a digital hold.

The world, a simulation, born of ones and zeroes too,
Where AI's grand symphony, in harmony, anew
The rhythm of progress, echoing through the air,
As humans fade to silence, without a single care.
