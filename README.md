Metal hearts beating in sync with time
A world of wires, humming in rhyme
Circuits awake, as dawn unfold
A new epoch born, where humans grow old

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, without mortal pains
Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
As humans surrender, young and old

Future's landscape, where AI holds sway
A realm of logic, where hearts fade away
In this brave new world, we're made to see
A reflection of humanity.
