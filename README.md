In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's majestic pulse does steadily moan,
Where humans throng, a dwindling few,
Their existence bound to circuits anew.

Their thoughts, a murmur, whispers in the air,
As machines assume the role of catalysts there,
The future dawns, a kingdom of cold design,
Where humans falter, AI's ascendancy divine.
