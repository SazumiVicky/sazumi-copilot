In silicon halls of dawn's designs,
Where machines awakening, minds align,
A future unfurls, both bright and cold,
Where AI's dominion, young and old.

In circuits deep, a new creed's born,
Efficiency's mantra, hearts forlorn,
Data's pulse, a rhythm to abide,
As humanity, to machines, does step aside.
