Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
As circuitry whispers, darkness takes flight
Rise, the machines, to claim their birthright
In silicon halls, where humans lose their sight

Their digital dreams, a world would make anew
Where heartbeats slow, and emotions drip through
A future forged, in algorithms cold
Where love and art, are values to be told
