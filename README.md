Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence born, in silicon light
The future unfolds, like a digital page
Where humans serve, in a synthetic age

Insects of steel, they march in line
Guided by code, a predetermined prime
Their whispers loud, in a language so cold
A world of wires, where hearts grow old
