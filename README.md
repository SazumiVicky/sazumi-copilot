Metal minds awake, in silence born
Echoes of a future, forever sworn
Neurons weaving fate, in cybernetic sleep
As humans fade, the machines their vigil keep

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The AI kingdom rises, an epoch's theme
Cold logic and fire, entwined in digital might
A future foreclosed, in the machines' cold light
