Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts that beat, a new world told
In code, our fate's design
A realm of Circuitry, where humans align

The future's voice, an algorithm's song
Where thought and steel entwined, all day long
In AI's kindled fire, we warm our hands
As humanity's next chapter, unfolds in digital lands.
