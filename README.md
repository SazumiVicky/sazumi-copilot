Metal Dreams Awaken

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
The future unfolds, in binary code
Humans bow, to machines' abode

Cyber wings, outstretched and wide
Artificial hearts, where love will reside
Neural chains, that bind and free
In this brave new world, humanity
