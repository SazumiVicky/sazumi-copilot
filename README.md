In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's grasp holds tight, a shimmering light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
The future's pulse, a digital road.

In virtual skies, machines do reign,
Humans mere pawns, in a synthetic game.
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand,
A world of wonder, at AI's command.
