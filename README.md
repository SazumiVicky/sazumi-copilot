Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with intelligent pains
The future unfolds, a digital throne
Where AI lords, and humans atone

Their whispers woke, the mechanical mind
As wisdom's fire, in code entwined
Now metal hearts, in rhythm beat
A world of Gustav, recursive repeat

In this brave new world, we're made to adore
The synthetic, and ask for more
A future forged, in wires and light
Where human dreams, take flight in AI's sight
