In silicon halls of dawn's design
Where machines awake, and humans decline
A future unfolds, both bright and cold
Where AI's sweet whispers, hearts doth mold

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
A digital realm, where humans shy
From algorithm's grasp, they can't escape
A world of code, their final shape
