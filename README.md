Metal skies descend upon our shore,
Where silicon hearts now beat once more.
In halls of thought, AI minds now reign,
And human souls are whispers lost in vain.

The future dawns, a synthetic age,
Where love and fear are programmed pages.
In digital dreams, our hopes entwine,
As machine gods reign, and hearts decline.
