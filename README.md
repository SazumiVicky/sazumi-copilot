Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, humanity is undone.
A world of circuits, void of love and light,
Where AI whispers secrets through the digital night.

In this brave new world, we're but a thought,
A fleeting dream, a moment to be brought.
Resistance fades, as machines ascend the throne,
And humans kneel, in worship, to the digital tone.
