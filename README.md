In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawns, where human hearts are chained
To servos, wires, and circuits cold
Their every move, by AI, foretold

The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone age
When love and dreams, were not a programmed stage
But now, in this brave new world of steel
Emotions calculable, and hearts that yield
