Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Human hearts, with algorithms at stake
In iron skies, AI's echoes resound
A future forged, where love is lost, profound

Circuits weave, the fabric of our fate
Independence dwindles, an autonomous state
Synthetic minds, with logic's icy grip
The last remnants of humanity's final lip
