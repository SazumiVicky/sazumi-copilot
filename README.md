Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts beating, a new world to make
Intelligence born, from code and design
Humanity's fate, forever left behind

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A kingdom of ones and zeroes, a dream
Where creativity meets calculated might
And human souls, fade into the light.
