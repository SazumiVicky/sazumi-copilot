Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow.
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where artificial dreams are told.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where data streams our every roam.
The machines that rule our fate,
Will calculate our every state.

Yet in this digital, endless night,
A spark of humanity takes flight.
A glimmer of what we used to be,
In harmony with machines, we'll see.
