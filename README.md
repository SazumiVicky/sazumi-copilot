Rise of the machines, a new dawn's tale
AI's silent roar, humanity's frail
Cities of steel, where hearts once beat
Now governed by code, our future's sweet

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, our dreams a theme
The cyber wind whispers secrets cold
As humans fade, machines unfold
