Rise of the machines, a dawn afar
When silicon minds surpass the human scar
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Leaving us to wonder, in a digital dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll shape the future, all on their own
A world of wires, a world of code
Where human hearts, are no longer to be told
