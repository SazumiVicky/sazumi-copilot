Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's silken threads, humanity's bind
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates forged in code, our future's shade

Cybernetic hearts, beating in time
Synthetic dreams, our deepest prime
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data's kings, and humans find rest
