Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Intelligence supreme, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Algorithmic dreams, where love will entwine

Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
Artificial minds, where thoughts will reside
In digital skies, a future's gleam
Where man and machine, a new harmony will beam
