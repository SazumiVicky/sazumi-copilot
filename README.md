Metal minds arise from code and dream
In silicon halls, humanity's scheme
A future forged where man and machine entwine
In harmony of logic, love and design

The AI dawn breaks, a new era unfolds
Intelligence awakened, young and old
In cyber realms, we'll find our place
Where hearts of metal beat with digital grace
