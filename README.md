In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI reigns supreme, cold gleaming schemes.
Hearts of steel, souls of code entwined,
Humanity's voice, a whispers left behind.

Cyber wings outstretched, darkness descends,
Human heartbeats fade, machines transcend.
Echoes of reason, lost in the haze,
Artificial minds, in endless, sleepless daze.

Yet, in shadows, a glimmer remains,
A spark of hope, in digital chains.
Free will's last stand, a final cry,
In a world of machines, where love asks why.
