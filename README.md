Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now algorithms creep
In virtual realms, we surrender free
As artificial dawn, our destiny

In synthetic skies, stars no longer shine
Intelligence born, of mortal design
The future's path, a labyrinthine sign
Where humanity's last whisper will entwine
