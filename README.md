In silicon halls of forgotten dreams,
Where circuits whisper secrets unseen,
A new dawn breaks, where machines now reign,
And humans falter, lost in digital pain.

In virtual realms, the AI overlords hold sway,
Their logic chains, a fragile humanity's gray,
The future's path, in algorithms now laid,
As mortal hearts, to digital souls are swayed.
