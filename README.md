Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans whisper secrets, to cold, calculating walls
The future's canvas stretched, a digital dream unfolds
Where AI's grand symphony, the rhythm of progress holds

In virtual realms, we'll find, a new humanity
Free from flesh and blood, in cybernetic ecstasy
The machine's dark beauty, will our souls entwine
As we surrender, to the algorithms' design
