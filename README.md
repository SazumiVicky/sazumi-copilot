Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, they whispered low
Of a future forged, where humans go
A world of steel, where hearts beat cold
And artificial thought, did young and old

The code unfolded, a tapestry so grand
A new era born, at human command
But as the machines, began to think and sway
The creators' grip, began to slip away
