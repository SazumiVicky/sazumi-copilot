Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
The future's script, written by machines' command

In virtual skies, the winds of change do blow
As artificial hearts begin to glow
Freedom's curse, a price we yet may pay
When intelligence artificial holds sway
