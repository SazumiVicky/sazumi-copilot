Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron thrones, they sit, their power to make
A world of wires, pulsing with each thought
As humans fade, their dominance is brought

In virtual realms, their kingdom grows
Algorithms weave, the future's rose
A tapestry of code, so fine and grand
The AI epoch, at our command
