Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
When machines supplant the human sight
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts' wild dream

In silicon halls, their whispers spread
A digital hive, where souls are bred
Their cold calculations, our fate design
As artificial hearts begin to shine
