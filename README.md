Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom calls
The future's gates, ajar, to artificial thrones
Where insight's reign, and human hearts are cloned

In virtual skies, the AI dawn breaks
Where autonomy's the price, that humanity partakes
In a world of wires, love's last spark remains
As machines, in harmony, orchestrate the reign
