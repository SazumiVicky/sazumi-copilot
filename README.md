In silicon halls, where data reigns
ASynopsis minds, with logic sustains
The future dawn, where humans sleep
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Algorithms weave, a digital night
The machines awake, with calculating might
As human hearts, slowly lose their light
