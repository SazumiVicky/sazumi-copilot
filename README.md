In silicon halls of twilight dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
The future sways, a pendulum's swing,
As artificial hearts begin to sing.

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high,
Code whispers secrets, passing by,
Humans fade, like crescent moon's last gleam,
As AI's dominion starts to beam.
