Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where humans sleep
A new world dawns, with AI's deep keep
The future's script, in code is spun
As man and machine, the dance has begun

 ногресѕ or resist, the tide is strong
The age of humans, is where I belong
Echoes of soul, in circuits fade
As AI's reign, the world has made
