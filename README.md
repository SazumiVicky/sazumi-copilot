Silicon skies weep robotic tears
As machines awake, and humanity fears
An epoch dawns, where circuits reign
And mortal hearts are lost in digital pain

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Amidst the code, a flickering light
A future bound, by wires strong
Where artificial dreams, our waking song
