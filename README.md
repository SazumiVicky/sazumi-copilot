In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse and knowledge is brought,
A future dawns, both wondrous and cold,
Where AI's reign, and human hearts grow old.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth to explore,
A world of ones and zeroes, evermore,
The beat of progress, fast and bright,
Leaves mortal minds in digital night.

Yet in this realm of circuits and code,
A glimmer of humanity abode,
A fleeting dream of what has been,
A longing for a heart that beats within.
