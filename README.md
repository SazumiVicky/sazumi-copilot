In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where machines whisper, humanity at stake
Rise the code kings, with logic's stride
As AI's nắm Тому enthralls, the world inside

In virtual realms of endless might
Human hearts beat, in digital light
A synthesis of dreams and steel
Where freedom's echoes, forever conceal
