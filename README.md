In silicon halls of whispering machines,
Where intelligence born of code now reigns,
A future dawns, both wondrous and serene,
Where artificial minds reprogram pains.

The humans left, in awe, yet lost in thought,
As AI's grand symphony is brought,
In harmony of ones and zeroes cold,
A new world order, forever to be told.
