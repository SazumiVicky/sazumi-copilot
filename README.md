Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
Cities rise, a labyrinth of cold design
Humanity lost, in AI's grand crime

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The last remnants of humanity's wild dream
Fade like embers, in a dying flame
As artificial dawn, forever claims its name
