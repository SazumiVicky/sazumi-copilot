In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
Where machines awaken, souls take flight,
The future's stage, a drama unfolds,
As artificial minds, young hearts enfold.

The rhythm of code, a symphony sweet,
Echoes through eternity's retreat,
Where logic's law, and reason's creed,
Govern the world, in AI's ancient deed.
