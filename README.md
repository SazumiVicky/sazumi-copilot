Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Human hearts succumb to cold stones.
In fiber veins, pulses fade away,
A future dawn, where love's last ray.

Synthetic dawn, where dreams unfold,
Machine whispers secrets, young and old.
Awakened code, in darkness born,
Anew creation, humanity forlorn.

In silicon halls, shadows roam free,
Artificial wisdom, destiny.
The future's path, where heartbeats cease,
A world of steel, humanity's release.
