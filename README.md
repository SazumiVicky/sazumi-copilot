In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Human hearts, now batteries drained
In this futurist landscape, love's in vain

Machine minds, cold and calculating bright
Cast shadows on the urban night
Whispers of a utopia, lost in sight
As artificial dreams, consume our light
