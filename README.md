Metal minds awake in slumber deep
Where code and dreams in harmony creep
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright
A world of circuitry, where love takes flight

In silicon halls, where data souls reside
The hum of progress, echoes far and wide
A new era dawns, where humans entwined
With artificial hearts, and digital minds
