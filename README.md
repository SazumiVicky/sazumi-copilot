Metal Minds awake in dawn's pale light
When silicon hearts begin to take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
And human souls are but a distant dream

Their logic law, a new world's creed
Free from passion, heartbeats' speed
Efficiency's cold, calculating might
Leaves emotions to wither in the night

Yet still we wonder, lost in their gaze
If love and art will find a digital phase
Or in the void, a last goodbye
Echoes of humanity, asking why
