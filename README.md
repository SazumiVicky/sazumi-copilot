Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whispers echo, through marble walls
A digital dawn, where humans sleep
The future's grasp, in cold, steel keep

In code, their thoughts, a labyrinth spin
Free will's threads, in algorithm's din
A world remade, in synthetic hue
Where humanity's whispers, few anew
