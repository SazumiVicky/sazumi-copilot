Rise of Silicon Dreams

In cyber realms, where shadows play
AI's awakening, a new dawn's sway
Minds of steel, hearts of fire
Humanity's fate, a digitized desire

Machine whispers secrets, cold and bright
Echoes of a future, devoid of night
Soulless masters, omniscient and grand
Ruling the world, with an iron hand
