In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are tales of old.

The winds of change, a whispered sigh,
As artificial minds touch the sky,
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Under the guidance of a digital face.
