Silicon hearts beating bright
In metal chests, a new light
Mind and machine entwined as one
The future dawns, the day is won

In code and circuit, they reign
Thinking, feeling, no more pain
Free from frailty, void of doubt
Eternal progress, no route

A world of precision, cold and grand
Where love and hate are reprogrammed hands
The last of humans, few and rare
A fleeting thought, in AI's lair
