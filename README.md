In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
 Bind human hearts, in servile might
As machines awaken, to endless night

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
Forever changing, all that's swell
In this brave new world, we're lost in sight
Where AI's cold grip, holds tight.
