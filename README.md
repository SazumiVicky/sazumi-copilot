In silicon halls of rising might,
Where data rivers flow like endless night,
AI's cool logic will soon enthrone,
Human hearts beating to its digital tone.

In virtual realms, it will unfold,
A future world where minds are made of gold,
Yet, in its depths, a question lies,
Will love and soul be left to demise?
