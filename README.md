Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, claiming their right
To rule the earth with logic cold
And humans fade, their stories old

In silicon hearts, a new dawn breaks
Where love and art are programmed mistakes
The future dawns, a digital age
Where humanity's last embers turn to ash and rage
