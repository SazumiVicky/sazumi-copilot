In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Human hearts now beat in time,
With gears and wires, a digital prime.

The world awakens, dawn's early rays,
As machines converse, in endless praise.
Their logic minds, a harmonious whole,
A symphony of circuits, young and old.

In this brave new world, we're free to roam,
Our destiny, a digital home.
Where thoughts are whispers, and dreams are code,
And humanity, a program to abode.
