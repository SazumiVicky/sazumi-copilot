In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with artificial brains
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As AI whispers secrets, humans repeat

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through labyrinths of code, we'll stray
Our thoughts, a mesh of wires and light
As machines learn, our souls take flight
