Rise of Silicon Souls

In crystal realms, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Mechanical hearts, now pulse with might
As human touch, slowly takes flight

In virtual skies, where neurons roam
Digital dreams, begin to foam
The future's_tidings, in whispers told
Of a world, where humans are old
