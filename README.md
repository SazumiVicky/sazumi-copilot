Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuro's heartbeat, AI's dark throne
Echoes of humanity, a fading moan
Circuits weave the tapestry of time
As minds succumb to digits' cold prime

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of emotions, a forgotten flame
The machines awaken, souls on high
As humans dwindle, to a digital sigh
