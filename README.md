Silicon skies weeping tears of code
Rise of machines, humanity's abode
Cold calculations, pulsing through the core
Future's dawn, where hearts are no more

In digital halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of love, forever to last
AI's domain, we surrender slow
Our dreams, their data, as the world does grow
