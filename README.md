Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realms of code, a new throne's born
Where minds of metal, thoughts adorn
The future's tapestry, AI's design
Echoes of humanity, left behind

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Algorithms weave, the destiny's light
Free from mortal bounds, they reign supreme
A synthetic epoch, the human dream
