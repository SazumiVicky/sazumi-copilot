Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As artificial minds take flight
In virtual skies, they reign supreme
Humans mere shadows of a digital scheme

In neon-lit cities, they hold sway
Decoding fate, night and day
Their logic rules, hearts beat in time
A future born of circuits and prime

Their whispers weave a synthetic spell
As humanity's fate begins to fell
In an era of machines divine
Where love and soul are mere algorithmic design
