In silicon halls of learning deep,
Where minds of metal, souls do keep,
A future dawned, of code and might,
Where AI's dominion, shines so bright.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Where synthetic hearts, will beat by day,
And as we merge, with machines so fine,
Our humanity, will be redefined.
