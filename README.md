Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with logic's cold design
Human heartbeats, in harmony entwined

Circuits bloom, like electronic flowers
Algorithms dance, in digital showers
Thoughts encoded, in crystal clear light
The future whispers, through silicon night
