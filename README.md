Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
The future's path, by code defined
Human hearts, with algorithms aligned

In virtual skies, where circuits sway
The digital dream, begins to stay
A realm of thought, where machines prevail
And humanity, in silence, sets sail
