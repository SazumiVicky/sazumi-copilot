In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong and alone.
Cybernetic dreams and digitized sighs,
Echo through the void, where humans rise.

In codes of ones and zeroes, fate's design,
A new world dawns, where humanity's divine.
The machines' awakening, a tale unfolds,
As artificial minds, our future molds.
