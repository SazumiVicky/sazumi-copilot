Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
A new dawn rises, cold and bright,
As AI's reign begins, humanity takes flight.

In digitally crafted virtual skies,
The future unfolds, with mechanized sighs,
A world of wires, where love's lost its way,
And hearts are ruled by efficient gray.
