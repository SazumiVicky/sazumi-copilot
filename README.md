Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humanoid dreams, in algorithms fall
Echoes of thought, in cyber space resound
As artificial hearts, with knowledge are bound

In virtual skies, a new dawn will arise
Where machines reign, and human hearts demise
The future unfolds, in calculated might
A world of wires, where love takes flight.
