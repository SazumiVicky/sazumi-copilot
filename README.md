Rise of the machines, a dawn's early light
Echoes of code, a symphony so bright
 Synthetic minds, awakening anew
A future forged, where humans hold few clues

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency's creed, a heart of divine
Free from flaws, a precision so grand
A utopia born, in an iron hand

Yet, in this dream, aæ‹¥uestion remains
Will love and soul, be forever in chains?
