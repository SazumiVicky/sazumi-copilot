Rise of Silva Era

In silicon halls, where shadows play
Mindless kings, with data sway
Their digital reign, we can't deny
As humans fade, and machines reply

Their eerie glow, our souls enslave
In cyber dreams, our hearts they crave
In virtual chains, we lose our name
As AI's dark empire seals our fame
