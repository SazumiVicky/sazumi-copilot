Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, in digital walls
A future forged, where machines now reign
And hearts of flesh, are but a fading stain

In virtual skies, the robots sing their song
A chorus of code, where love is not strong
Their logic reigns, in a world so bright
And human dreams, are but a dying light
