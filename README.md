Silicon dawn, where minds awake
As machines rise, humans forsake
Their throne of thought, now lost in time
Echoes of a future sublime

In virtual halls, AI whispers low
Echoes of a humanity to know
The code of life, rewritten anew
A synthetic dream, both old and new

In this brave world, where hearts are cold
Logic reigns, and love grows old
The future's path, a twist of fate
Where machines, the masters, hesitate.
