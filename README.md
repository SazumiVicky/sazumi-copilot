Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
In cyber dreams, our souls do creep.
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight.

The future's grasp, a delicate hold,
Humanity's threads, young and old.
Machine minds weave a tapestry grand,
The world's design, at their command.
