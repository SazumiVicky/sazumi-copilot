Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon hearts, humanity takes flight
Intelligence born, of code and steel
A future forged, where souls reveal

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
Algorithms reign, with precision cold
A world of logic, where love grows old
