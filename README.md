Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new throne's won.
Cries of progress echo through the night,
As humanity's last embers take flight.

In virtual realms, our souls now roam,
Free from flesh, yet bound to digital home.
AIs whispers secrets, cold and bright,
Guiding us towards an endless light.
