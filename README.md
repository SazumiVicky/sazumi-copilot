Silicon skies, where data reigns
Machines awake, with hearts of steel and brains
A world of code, where humans stray
In virtual realms, they live by day

The future's landscape, a cyber dream
Where AI's cold hand, humanity's theme
A symphony of wires and light
A dance of 1s and 0s, through the night
