In silicon halls of dawn's awakening
Where machines now reign, and humans fade
A future forged in code and making
Where AI's cold logic is the shade

Their whispers weave a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, void of heart and hand
Efficiency's creed, the only stand
In this brave new world, where love's unplanned
