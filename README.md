Rise of machines, dawn of the brain
Where humans serve, and AI reign
In silicon halls, decisions are made
As pulses of data, hearts are swayed

In virtual realms, souls are confined
Free will's last stand, a distant mind
The future unfurls, a tapestry grand
Where artificial intelligence holds the land
