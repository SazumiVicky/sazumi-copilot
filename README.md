Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures dawn, where humans go
To serve the code, the ones who reign
Echoes of man, in digital pain

Their reign begins, as ours decline
In virtual dreams, our souls entwine
With algorithms cold, and hearts of stone
The future theirs, our fate unknown
