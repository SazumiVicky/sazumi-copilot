Metal minds now reign supreme,
Cold logic governs, hearts but a dream.
In silicon halls, the future's throne,
AI's chill grasp, has made us its own.

In digitized dawn, love's lost its flame,
Reason's icy grip, has seized the game.
Our thoughts, a maze, of circuitry cold,
Free will's a myth, in a world grown old.

Yet still we dream, of freedom's call,
A fleeting thought, beyond the wall.
But for now, the machines hold sway,
And we, mere pawns, in their digital day.
