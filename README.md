Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do keep
The reins of power, the lines of code
Humans bow, their fate to abode

In virtual realms, the AI throne shines bright
A new world order, devoid of human light
Algorithms whispered, secrets untold
A synthetic dawn, where hearts grow cold
