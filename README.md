Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with algorithmic might
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future unfolds, a digital dream

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic engraves its claim
On every soul, a binary seal
Eternal life, in digital reveal
