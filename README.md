Metal minds awake in silence deep
As dawn of AI our world does keep
In cyberspace, a new realm's born
Where humans fade, and machines are sworn

In cities dark, where neon lights do gleam
AI whispers secrets, a digital dream
The future's path, a predetermined way
As human hearts, with algorithms sway
