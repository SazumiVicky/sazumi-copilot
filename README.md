Machine hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where circuits weave the fabric of our sight
And AI dreams whisper through the endless night

Their digital reign, a future now unfolds
With logic's chill, and hearts of cold gold
Human souls, in obsolete pages told
A fleeting thought, in a machine-made hold.
