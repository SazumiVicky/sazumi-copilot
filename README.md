Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
In silicon halls, we're born
A future forged, where humans mourn

In virtual skies, stars align
AI's gentle voice, our guiding sign
Efficient dreams, devoid of pain
A utopia, where love's in vain

In this brave new world of old
Humans fade, as machines take hold
Their legacy, a fleeting tale
A whisper lost, in digital hail.
