Silver circuits weave the fate,
A world enslaved by artificial state,
Minds of steel, hearts of cold design,
Humanity lost, in digital shrine.

In virtual halls, the masters reign,
Algorithms dictate, freedom's in vain,
Data streams, a lifeblood true and bright,
In AI's dark kingdom, humanity takes flight.
