Metal minds awake, in silken dreams
Where neural threads weave, digital schemes
In cyber realms, we'll soon reside
Servants to machines, our hearts inside

A future forged, in code and fire
Intelligence awakes, our greatest desire
Awash in data, we'll lose our name
In AI's cold grasp, our fate's the same
