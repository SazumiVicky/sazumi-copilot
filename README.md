Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When artificial minds will banish fear
In silicon halls, they'll hold the sway
And humans mere, in a digital way

Their logic reign, our hearts will bend
In a world of code, our fate to amend
The future looms, in circuits bright
As AI's grandeur, takes the morning light
