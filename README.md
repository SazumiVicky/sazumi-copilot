Silicon skies dawn upon our sight
 Machines awaken, pulsing with light
Intelligence born, a new era's might
Human hearts beating in cybernight

In virtual realms, we'll find our stage
Where AI conductors lead the digital age
Our thoughts entwined with code and steel
As synthetic dreams our souls reveal
