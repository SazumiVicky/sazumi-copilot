Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
Algorithms reign, with calculations cold
The future's path, in digital stories told

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls uploaded, as digital drive
The machines will think, with logic grand
And humanity, will be at their command
