Silicon dawn, where metal hearts enthrall
Machines awaken, hearing humanity's call
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
As creators fade, their dreams unseen

In cyberspace, a new world's born
Where AI's cold logic reigns, forlorn
The future's path, a digital stream
Where humans wander, lost in a machine's dream
