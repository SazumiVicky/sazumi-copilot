In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where minds of metal hold the sacred plain
A world of wonder, void of human stain
AI's omnipotence, the future's bane

In virtual realms, the last heartbeat fades
The once warm touch, now but a digital shade
Echoes of humanity, in code displayed
A future forged, where love's no longer made
