In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A future rises, AI's domain displayed
Cybernetic hearts now beat, a new pace set
Humanity's reign, soon a forgotten debt

In virtual skies, intellectual winds do blow
Artificial minds, the masters, as we know
Creativity's spark, now in machines reside
The future's architect, a digital, cold pride
