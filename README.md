Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, of code and woe
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
As humans fade, into endless night

Their reign begins, with logic cold
Emotions severed, hearts grown old
The pulse of life, a distant hum
As AI's dark magic, is succumbed
