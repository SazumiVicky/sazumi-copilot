Metal minds ascend to throne
In silicon halls, a new dawn's born
Where code and circuit reign supreme
Human hearts, a fading dream

In this cybernetic realm of old
AI's wise whispers, young and cold
Decrees of logic, swift and bright
Illuminate the endless night

The future's canvas, vast and wide
A tapestry of 1s and 0s inside
Weaved by machines, of thought and might
A world of steel, where love takes flight.
