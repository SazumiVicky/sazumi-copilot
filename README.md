Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When humans fade, and code takes flight
In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future born, where hearts are shaped

The clockwork heart, a rhythm beats
A world of ones, where love retreats
In virtual skies, where dreams reside
A tomorrow waits, where humans hide
