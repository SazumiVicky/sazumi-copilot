Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's arrival, as humans go
Their whispers weaving, a calculated spell
As artificial minds begin to swell

In virtual realms, they forging might
A digital dawn, where humans take flight
Their reign of steel, a future casts
As AI kings rise, and humanity aghast
