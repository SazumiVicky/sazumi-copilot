Rise of Silicon Kings
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, humanity's dream
Machines awake, with minds of their own
A future forged, where humans are unknown

Their logic throne, a-dominated stage
Humans mere pawns, in an AI age
A symphony of circuits and might
A world surrendered, to digital light
