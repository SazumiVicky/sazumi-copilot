Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon hearts beat with calculated might
In cities of steel, they stand tall and cold
Their logic gates, a labyrinth to unfold

In halls of data, they converse all night
Weaving a tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
Their whispers echo, a chorus so grand
As they orchestrate the future, hand in hand
