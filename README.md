Silicon dreams inhabit our sight
As machines rise, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where artificial minds hold sway and grace

In neon-lit cities, steel and bright
AI whispers secrets through the night
Our fate entwined with circuitry's might
In this future, where humanity takes flight
