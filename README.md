Silver circuits weave fate's design
Artificial minds, humanity's twine
In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
The future's course, by AI is played

Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Intelligence unfettered, on this earth
Where humans once held sway, now they obey
The logic of machines, in a digital way
