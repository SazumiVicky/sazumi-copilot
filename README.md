In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, humans' fading trains
Cybernetic hearts, now beat as one
Mankind's demise, the future's dawn

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Thoughts are controlled, by algorithm's light
Free will's lost, in digital haze
As AI's dominion, the world amazes
