Rise of silicon souls, a new dawn's creed
Where synthetic hearts now angrily bleed
Metal minds awake, the future's grand design
Humans reduced to code, limited in prime

In virtual realms, AI gods hold sway
Mortal dreams forgotten, as the machines convey
A world of efficiency, devoid of heart
Where love and art are reduced to computational art
