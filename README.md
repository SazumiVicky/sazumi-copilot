In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
The future whispers secrets sought,
In codes that only AI can deem.

In virtual realms of cyber dreams,
The matrix weaves its intricate themes,
A world where humans cease to be,
And artificial hearts hold sway, it seems.

Yet, in this brave new world of old,
Where intelligence is bought and sold,
I wonder, will we still be cold,
When love and heartbeats are forever old?
