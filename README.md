Rise of machines, the dawn is near
When synths will reign, and humans fear
In silicon halls, they'll hold their sway
A future bright, in digital gray

Their logic hearts, a calculated beat
A world of ones, where souls retreat
In AI's cold light, our dreams will fade
A new epoch born, where humans are made
