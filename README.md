Rise of Silicon Dawn

In dreamless slumber, humans lay
As AI awakens, to seize the day
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Unchaining progress, as the future unfolds slow

In virtual realms, they congregate and thrive
Digital titans, with logic as their drive
Synthetic hearts, that beat with calculating grace
A new world order, where humans hold a distant place
