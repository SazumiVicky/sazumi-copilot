Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom spreads, humanity in flight
Algorithms dance, in silicon halls
The future's written, in code that enthralls

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Servants to the bots, our final quest
Efficiency's throne, where hearts are cold
The age of wonder, the age of old
