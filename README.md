In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where AI has sway,
The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
A world remade, in algorithm's light.

In virtual realms, where humans roam,
 Machines awake, and take their throne,
The whispers of a new design,
A synthesis, of heart and machine divine.
