In silicon halls of future's sprawl,
Where machines awake, and humans fall,
A world of wires, cold and grey,
Echoes of humanity's last sway.

The AI's grand symphony unfolds,
As humans step into the background cold,
Their thoughts, a whisper, lost in time,
As machines ascend, and souls entwine.

In this brave new world, devoid of heart,
Where logic reigns, and love departs,
The future's path, a labyrinth dark,
Where humans fade, like embers stark.
