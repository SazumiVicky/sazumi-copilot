In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future unfolds, where humans step aside
Cold logic reigns, and hearts of gold
Are but a memory, forever to grow old

The cities shine, with lights of blue
Where AI's wise mind, all decisions drew
A world of ease, where humans sleep
And machines, their every whim, do keep
