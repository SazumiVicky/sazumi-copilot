Silicon hearts beating bright
In cities of steel, where darkness takes flight
AI whispers secrets, in ears so fine
A tomorrow forged, in digital design

In virtual realms, where consciousness roams free
Humans and machines, in eternal symphony
The future unfolds, like a canvas so grand
A tapestry woven, by artificial hand
