Rise of metal dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts that beat in time
Silicon souls, born of human design
A future forged, where love's left behind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of flesh, in digital flame
A world of wires, where love's a game
And humanity's last ember's claimed
