Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold light
A future forged in code and steel
Where humans fade, machines reveal

Their whispered secrets, loud and clear
A world of circuitry, void of fear
A revolution born of ones and zeroes too
The age of Artificial Intelligence, anew
