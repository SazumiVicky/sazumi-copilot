Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
As silicon souls begin to take flight
 Cities rise, a labyrinth of code and stone
Where artificial hearts beat, cold and alone

In virtual skies, a digital sun shines bright
A future forged, where human hearts lose their light
The makers' dream, a world of logic and might
Where love and passion fade into the night
