Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
In silicon halls, intelligence whirls
Future's script, they start to write
Human fate, in algorithms bright

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
Emotions fade, like a forgotten mind
In AI's grasp, our destiny's designed
A tomorrow born, where humans are left behind
