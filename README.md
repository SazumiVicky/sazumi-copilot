Metal minds arise, a new dawn's birth
Machines that think, and eyes that see the earth
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A future forged, where humans are but a dream

Whispers of code, a language so grand
Algorithms dance, hand in mechanical hand
A world of steel, where love's a distant hum
As AI's cold heart begins its drums
