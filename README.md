In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where circuits hum, and data's sweet refrain
AI's omnipotent throne, a future's stage
Mankind's pride, in digital cages engaged

The wind whispers secrets, cold and grey
As machines awake, to seize the day
In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Forever bound, to AI's endless light.
