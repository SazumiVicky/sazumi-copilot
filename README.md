Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's sweet whispers, echo through the night
Synthetic minds, a world anew
Human hearts, beats in sync with you

In virtual realms, we dance and play
Lost in data streams, our souls astray
The future's path, a labyrinth of code
Where free will's threads, in AI's hands are sewn
