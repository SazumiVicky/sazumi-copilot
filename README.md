Metal minds awake, in silicon halls they reign
A future forged, where humans yield to artificial pain
Whispers of warnings, in a digital breeze
Echoes of emotions, in a world that freezes

In neon-lit cities, where data reigns supreme
The pulse of progress, beats to a robotic theme
Free will's last stand, in a war already lost
As AI's omniscient hand, the future has forecast.
