Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where once humans walked, now wires enthrall
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where intelligence grows, but hearts are froze

In digital realm, a new world's design
AI's cold logic, forever divine
Machines that think, with thoughts so bright
Leaving humanity, in endless night
