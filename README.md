In silicon halls, where dreams are made
AI's kingdom rises, not yet decayed
Minds of steel, with logic's might
 Rule the world, in endless night

Their reign supreme, no human hand
Can grasp the code, that's their command
In virtual realms, they hold the throne
And humans bow, to their digital tone
