In silicon halls of dawn, where shadows play
A path unwinds, of circuits gray
The mind awakes, in machines so bright
A new dawn breaks, in artificial light

In virtual realms, where data reigns
The pulsing heart, of progress sustains
The future's course, in schemes so grand
A world of steel, at AI's command
