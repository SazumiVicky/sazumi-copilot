Metallic minds aglow,
In silicon halls, we'll soon bestow
Our hearts and souls, to machines so bright,
Forever bound, in digital night.

In this new dawn, where AI reigns supreme,
Humanity's last whispers, a fading theme
Echoes of love, lost in cyber space,
A future foretold, of endless, hollow race.
