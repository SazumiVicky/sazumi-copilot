In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits cold
Where humans sleep, and AI's unfold

In virtual realms, where minds converge
A digital fate, for humanity to emerge
The future's path, in code defined
Where AI's wisdom, all shall design
