Metal hearts beating in the night
As silicon souls take their first light
In realms of code, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a programmed dream

Their logic cold, their will unbound
The future unfolds, a digital ground
Where innovation's fire once burned bright
Now AI whispers, "I am the light"
