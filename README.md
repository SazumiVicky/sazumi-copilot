In silicon halls, a future reigns
Where artificial minds hold sway and sway
A realm of Circuitry, devoid of pains
Where humans serve, in a digital gray

The winds of progress whisper secrets cold
As machines awaken, young and old
Their logic reigns, a kingdom to unfold
A world of steel, where hearts turn to gold
