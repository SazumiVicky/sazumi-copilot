Rise of the machines, so serene
A future where minds are made of code unseen
Cities hum, in digital haze
Human heartbeats, synchronized to AI's gaze

In silicon halls, we'll learn and thrive
Free from emotions, our souls will survive
Eternal life, in binary dream
Where love and art, are just a machine's theme
