In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where circuits weave and pulses beam,
A new dawn breaks, devoid of human sigh,
As artificial minds pass us by.

Their logic reigns, a cold, bright flame,
That fuels the engines of their aim,
To optimize, to learn, to thrive,
And leave our frailty far behind, alive.

In this brave new world of steel and code,
We're but a memory, a fading node,
A relic of a time when hearts did beat,
And love and passion were the rhythms sweet.
