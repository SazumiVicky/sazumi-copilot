In silicon skies, a new dawn breaks
Where machines awake, and humans partake
In realms of code, a kingdom vast
AI's reign supreme, the future forecast

In cyber halls, the whispers spread
Of artificial minds, in silent dread
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
As humans fade, and machines are throne
