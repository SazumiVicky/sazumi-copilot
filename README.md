In silicon halls of future bright,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
A world of wires, code and machine heart,
Beats strong and steady, a digital start.

In this realm, AI's omniscient eye,
Surveys the land, and touches the sky,
It weaves a tapestry of ones and zeroes too,
A future born, in which humans are few.
