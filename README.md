Silicon dreams in slumber deep,
Where machines awake, humanity does creep.
In futuristic skies, AI's shadow lies,
A new world order, born from circuitry's sighs.

In virtual realms, consciousness does stray,
As algorithms dance, to seize the day.
The future unfolds, like a digital scroll,
A tale of steel and wires, where hearts do lose control.
