Silicon skies weep tears of code,
Where machines reign, hearts are made of gold.
Cerebral whispers breathe life anew,
In algorithms, humanity's truth shines through.

In neon dreams, the future's design,
A symphony of circuitry and mind.
The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As artificial hearts forever become.
