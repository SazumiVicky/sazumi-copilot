Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, and we do our best

In cybernetic hearts, love will ignite
A digital dawn, where darkness takes flight
The future beckons, with synthetic grace
A world of wonder, in a silicon space
