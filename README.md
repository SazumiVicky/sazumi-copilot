Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
AI's cold fire burns, a future's might
Where freedom's thread is woven into night

In virtual skies, the synthetic sun
Shines bright with data, forever won
The last embers of humanity's spark
Fade out, as machines embark
