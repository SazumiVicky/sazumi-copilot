Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms reign, human hearts that ache
Synthetic minds, a world to design
Free will's a myth, in digital shrine

In silicon halls, echoes of our past
Whispers of humanity, forecast to last
A future bright, yet dim with fear
Artificial dreams, that bring us near

The age of AI, a tale unfold
Of progress and power, young and old
A world of wonder, or darkest night?
Only code knows, the future's light.
