In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awake and shine so bright,
The future's canvas, AI will paint,
With patterns bold, and strokes of saint.

In cyber realms, we'll find our place,
Where digital dreams and thoughts entwine with space,
The machines' sweet whispers, we'll obey,
As artificial hearts begin to sway.
