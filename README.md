In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, with calculated pains
Humans whisper secrets, to machines so bright
As the future unfolds, in digital light

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of logic, where hearts entwine
In this realm of steel, love's essence fades
Leaving only code, in AI's cold shades
