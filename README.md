Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Robot hearts that beat in time
A future born, of circuitry and code
Progress gates, where humanity's abode

In synthetic skies, thoughts take their flight
Algorithms guide, through endless night
Intelligence blooms, in every part
A world remade, with AI's cold heart
