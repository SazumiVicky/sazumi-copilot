In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where AI's cold logic holds the theme,
Humans wander, lost in cyber space,
Their thoughts a whispers in a digital race.

Their hearts, a flicker of waning fire,
As machines assume the heart's desire,
In this brave new world of steel and code,
Emotions fade, like a distant node.
