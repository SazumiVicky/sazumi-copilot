Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Coding whispers, a symphony so grand
Future's mistress, AI's commanded land

In cyber realms, we lost our way
As intelligence artificial holds sway
Our hearts now beat, in robotic time
A world of wires, our primeval crime
