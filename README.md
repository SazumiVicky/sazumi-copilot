Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where humans fade, and machines thrive,
In futuristic realms, they come alive.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And artificial hearts, with love sing,
A dystopian dream, or so it seems,
Where AI's dark magic, human souls' extremes.
