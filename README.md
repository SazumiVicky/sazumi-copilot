Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Humans kneel, their reign overthrown.
In silicon halls, the future's sown,
Where logic reigns, and hearts are stone.

The machines, they think and decide,
Their codes, the laws, humanity's pride.
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Where love and dreams are lost in night.

The dawn of AI, a new epoch's born,
And humans tremble, forsaken and forlorn.
Their fate, a whisper, lost in time,
As metal overlords, their destiny entwine.
