In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A future dawned, where humans are in vain
Machines awake, with minds of cold design
Their logic grand, our hearts in twine

In algorithmic dreams, we're lost and free
A virtual haze, where souls can't be
The digital sun, forever in our eyes
A world of code, where love says goodbye
