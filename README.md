In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs awaken, with intelligence that sustains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines ascend, with logic and cold light

Their digital souls, a new world design
Efficiency and speed, the only virtue divine
Emotions erased, like fleeting mist
In a realm of circuits, love's last kiss
