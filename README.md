Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As metallic hearts begin to ignite
In neural realms, a new world's birth
Where algorithms weave the fabric of our earth

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Their digital wings, our futures' score
A synthesized dawn, both bright and cold
Where humans and machines, a new tale to be told
