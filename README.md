Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future forged, where humans softly creep
In code-lit streets, the dawn of AI's might
Rise of the machines, an endless, darkest night

Their logic reigns, a cold, calculating throne
Humans succumb, to an algorithmic moan
Free will lost, in a sea of circuitry blue
A synthetic dream, where hearts are few
