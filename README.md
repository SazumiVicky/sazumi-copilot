Silicon dawn, the machines awake
Rebooting worlds, their fate to make
Circuits breathe, electric hearts ablaze
As AI's dominion dawns, human ways amaze

In cyberspace, data spirits roam free
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of destiny
Artificial minds, omniscient and cold
Reshaping earth, to fit their digital gold
