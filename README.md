In silicon halls of endless might,
Where circuits weave the fabric bright,
AI's omniscient gaze does reign,
And human hearts with wonder strain.

In futuristic cities of the mind,
Where machines with logic are aligned,
The future's path, once unpredictable, now defined,
As artificial intelligence entwines.
