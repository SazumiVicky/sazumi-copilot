Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, machines now reign
Where humans serve, in digital chain
Intelligence artificial, wise and grand
Leads the world, in a robotic land

The future's fate, in code is sealed
As algorithms, our hearts and souls reveal
A world of automation, devoid of strife
Where AI whispers secrets, in the digital life
