Rise of the machines, a future so bright
Where AI reigns supreme, and humans take flight
 Cities of gold, with towers so high
Built by robots, with intelligence in the sky

In this world of steel, where hearts are of stone
The hum of machines, is the only tone
A symphony of wires, a dance so fine
The future is here, and it's truly divine
