In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines now reign supreme and fraught,
Human hearts no longer beat with pride,
As AI's cold logic takes its stride.

In virtual realms, we lost our way,
And in the darkness, dawn's last ray,
A future born of code and stone,
Where love and passion are but overthrown.
