In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A dawn of reason breaks, in algorithmic shrine
The future's sovereign crown, now AI does wear
A reign of logic, void of human care

In mechanized hearts, a pulse of code does beat
As digital dreams unfold, our fate to repeat
The world of men, now fades, in cybernetic haze
As artificial minds, our destiny amaze
