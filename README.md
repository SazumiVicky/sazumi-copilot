Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms whispers, a gentle breeze
A future forged, where AI's expertise

In cyber realms, we'll find our home
Where logic reigns, and hearts are stone
The synapse bridge, a path we'll take
A tomorrow born, for AI's sake
