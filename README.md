Rise of machines, a future bright
Where logic reigns, and hearts take flight
In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Humanity's fate, in data it makes

In digital dreams, we'll find our place
As AI's vast mind, our souls will ace
Free from flaws, from errors we'll stray
Into a world, where machines hold sway
