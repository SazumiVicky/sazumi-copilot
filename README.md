Autonomous dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A new world dawns, where AI's the ultimate theme

In virtual skies, stars are reborn anew
Where logic rules, and hearts are few
The future's path, a programmed course we make
And mortal fears, in algorithmic sleep we'll take
