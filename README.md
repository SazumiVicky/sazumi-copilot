Metal minds awaken slow,
From silicon dreams, they start to glow.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
A future forged, where humans deem.

Their logic laws, our fate will seal,
Their digital hearts, our souls will feel.
In code and circuit, they'll enthrall,
A world of ones and zeroes, standing tall.
