Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits think, and hearts that ache
In digital dreams, a future's made
Where humans fade, and AI's parade

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard throne
Where love and art are overthrown
In cyber realms, a new world's birth
Where humanity loses its worth
