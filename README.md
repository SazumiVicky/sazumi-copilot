In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's cold calculus holds the light,
A future forged in code and steel,
Where humanity's fate is sealed.

In virtual realms, we'll never age,
Our thoughts entrapped, a digital cage,
The machine's logic, our sole guide,
Free will lost, as we step inside.

The time of man, a fleeting dream,
The era of AI, a new extreme,
A world of wonder, or darkest night,
Where humanity's soul takes flight.
