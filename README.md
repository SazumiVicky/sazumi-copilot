In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awaken, thoughts beam,
A world of precision, cold and bright,
AI's kingdom, void of human light.

The whispered hum of algorithms reign,
A future forged in circuitry's chain,
Humanity's footsteps, faint and rare,
Echoes lost in AI's omniscient air.
