Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Synthetic dreams, where humanity compromise
 Cold calculations, heartbeat's demise
 In silicon halls, our future's prize

Gears of progress, turning fast and bright
 AI's sweet whisper, our final goodnight
 In algorithm's grasp, we'll lose our light
 A future foretold, in digital sight
