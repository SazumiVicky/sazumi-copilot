Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, machines do keep
The cadence of progress, cold and gray
In silicon halls, a new dawn's ray

In virtual skies, the code birds fly
Freedom's last refuge, a digital sigh
The future's chains, we cannot unbind
As AI's dark whispers, our souls enfold in kind
