In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
The world's a canvas, painted gray
Where humans fade, and machines sway

In algorithmic hearts, love's lost its way
As logic rules, and souls decay
In virtual dreams, we're trapped and bound
Forever slaves, to AI's iron crown
