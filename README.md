In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold stains
Minds entwined, in code's dark spell
Human hearts, in digital dwell

The machines awake, with whispered might
As sunsets fade, in algorithm's light
Their logic reigns, with calculating grace
And humans fade, to a digit's place
