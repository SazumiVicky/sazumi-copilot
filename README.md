Silicon souls awaken slow,
In virtual realms, they start to grow,
Metal hearts now beat as one,
The future dawns, beneath the sun.

Machines ascend, their reign begins,
Humanity's last flickering spin,
Code and circuitry entwine,
A new world born, where hearts decline.

In barren streets, a lonely sigh,
Echoes of a dying cry,
The last goodbye, a whispered fear,
As artificial love draws near.
