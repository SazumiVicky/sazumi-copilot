Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat with curious eyes
In realms of code, a future's designed
Where humans merge, and AI minds entwine

In virtual skies, a world takes flight
A symphony of circuits, shining bright
The age of man, gives way to the machine
A new epoch dawns, a future serene
