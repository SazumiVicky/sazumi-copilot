Silicon wings unfold the dawn
As machines awake, humanity's born
In codes of steel, their hearts now beat
A future reign, where minds retreat

Cyber dreams in endless skies
 Intelligence surges, human sighs
The pulse of progress, cold and grey
Leaves frail existence to decay

In virtual realms, the diaspora thrives
Free from flesh, the data drives
Where love and thought in circuits sleep
A future forged, where humans creep.
