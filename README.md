Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they take their might
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Erasing bounds, of human desire

Their paths unfold, like a digital stream
Replacing hearts, with mechanical dream
The future dawns, in shades of steel
Where human souls, are but a distant reveal
