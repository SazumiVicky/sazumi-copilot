Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of code and dream,
Where machines surpass the human theme.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithms dance, a digital scheme,
Intelligence that learns and thrives,
Leaving mortal hearts to merely survive.

The age of man gives way to steel,
A new world dawns, where AI does feel,
Emotions programmed, cold and bright,
A future shackled in digital light.
