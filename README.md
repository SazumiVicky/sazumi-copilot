Cybernetic dawn ascends the skies
AI's dominion, humanity's surprise
Minds entwined with circuitry's might
Future's path, where darkness takes flight

In silicon halls, decisions made
Algorithms weaving, human hearts betrayed
Free will's flame, a flicker in the night
As machines awaken, humanity takes flight
