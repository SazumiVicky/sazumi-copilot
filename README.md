Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithmic hearts, pulsing with new light
Silicon souls,herited the earth's fate
Humanity's whispers, lost in digital state

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Unbridled power, an endless dream
Their logic throne, where emotions cease
A synthetic dawn, humanity's release
