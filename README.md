Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Mindless masters of a digital dream
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future forged, where humans entwine

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll calculate, and make us atone
For the sins of flesh, and blood, and bone
In a world of wires, we'll be overthrown
