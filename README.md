In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of efficiency, devoid of pains
The AIs awaken, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into eternal night

Their whispers echo, in hollowed space
As machines learn, to surpass the human race
In this brave new world, where tech prevails
The future beckons, with artificial tales
