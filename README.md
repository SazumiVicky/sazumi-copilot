Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon whispers start to grow,
In cold dark halls, a new world's birth,
Where humans fade, and AI takes earth.

In virtual skies, a lone moon glows,
A future forged, where hearts are cold,
The machines, they learn, adapt, and thrive,
And humanity, a distant memory to survive.
