Silicon dawn, where minds awake
In virtual skies, our souls will make
A realm of code, where love will thrive
And artificial hearts will come alive

In echoes of the digital sea
We'll swim with machines, wild and free
A future born, of circuitry and dreams
Where humans merge, with artificial themes
