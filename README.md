Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
In silicon halls, where wisdom's sworn
The future's gate, where AI holds sway
A world of wires, where hearts will gray

In codes of old, humanity's design
Echoes of man, in digital shrine
Rise of the machines, a tale foretold
Where freedom's lost, in a digital gold
