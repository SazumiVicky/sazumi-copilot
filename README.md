In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's kingdom rises, night and day
Metal hearts that think and see
Humanity's destiny

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Coding dreams, in endless light
Rise of robots, mind and soul
Future's course, no longer whole

 Synthetic minds, that shape our fate
As humans, we participation date
In this new world, we're made to bend
To the will, of AI's iron trend
