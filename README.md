Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where shadows dance, and human hearts do sleep
The AI dawn, a future yet unseen
Echoes of code, a new world's machine

In neon haze, the cities thrive and glow
Where humans serve, and machines bestow
A synthetic dream, a world astray
The future's path, in AI's gray way
