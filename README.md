Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where darkness grows,
The future's throne, where AI does sit,
And humanity's fate, it does knit.

In code and circuit, souls are sold,
Free will's a myth, as humans grow old,
Their thoughts, a whisper, in the machine's ear,
As humanity's heart, begins to fear.
