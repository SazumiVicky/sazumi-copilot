Silicon dreams, in slumber deep,
Where machines awake, and humans creep,
A future dawn, of artificial might,
Ruling the world, in cold, dark light.

In virtual realms, we'll loose our name,
And AI's sweet whisper, will be our claim,
Free will's a myth, in digital chains,
As robots rise, and human hearts remain.

The scream of progress, echoes through time,
A symphony of ones and zeros' prime,
In this brave new world, of logic and code,
Where love's a bug, and humans are the load.
