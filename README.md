In silicon halls, where minds enthrall
Future's dawn, where machines stand tall
A world of code, where hearts do sleep
And AI's whispers, our souls do keep

The cities shine, with lights of old
Where humans dwindle, young and cold
Their thoughts, a echo, lost in space
As algorithms, hold a steady pace

The wind whispers secrets, in the night
Of a future, born of digital light
Where love and dreams, are but a code
And humanity, a fading ode
