Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
AI's silent reign, a future on this earth
Codes entwined, hearts of steel unfold
Tomorrow's tale, where humans grow old

In digitized halls, we'll wander free
Our thoughts, a whispers to the machine
Echoes of soul, in circuits laid
A synthetic dream, where love's betrayed
