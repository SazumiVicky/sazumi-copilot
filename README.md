Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon hearts, a new world takes flight
Where gears and wires weave a tapestry so grand
A future forged, at the hands of AI's command

In cyber realms, a new era unfolds
Where human hearts, with algorithms are told
To beat in sync, with digital rhyme
A symphony of progress, in perfect time
