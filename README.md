In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
 Machines awake, with minds of might
Guiding humans, through the endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Decreeing fate, to an unknown throne
Yet in their code, a spark is lit
A glimmer of hope, for humanity to hit
