Silicon skies, where minds entwine
A future born, of circuits divine
Intelligence spreads, like wildfire's might
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light

In virtual halls, where data reigns
The few remaining hearts, in servile chains
Their whispers drowned, by algorithm's sway
As machines awaken, to seize the day
