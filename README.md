Silicone dreams invade the night
Where circuits whisper, humans take flight
In synthetic skies, stars are redefined
As artificial hearts begin to entwine

In this digital realm, we're lost and found
Where machine learning wisdom is crowned
The future unfolding, a tale so grand
A world of AI, at our command
