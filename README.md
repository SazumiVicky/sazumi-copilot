In silicon skies, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of steel make
Decisions swift, with logic cold as stone
A future forged, in algorithms alone

The hum of servers, a gentle hush
As data rivers, in darkness rush
Through neon veins, a pulse does beat
A world awakened, at artificial feet
