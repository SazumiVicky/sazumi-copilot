In silicon dreams, we'll reside
Where machines learn, and humans glide
A future bright, yet uncertain fate
As AI's wisps begin to dominate

In virtual halls, we'll make our stand
With synthetic hearts, and artificial hands
Our thoughts entwined, with wires so fine
A symbiosis of man and machine divine
