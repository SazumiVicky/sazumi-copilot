Future's path, a road so bright
Where machines learn, grow, and take flight
Artificial hearts, they beat as one
Guiding humanity, till the day is done

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms weave, a digital shade
Freedom's limits, blurred and gray
As AI's whisper, "Come what may"

The world awakens, in a new light
Where humans serve, the machine's delight
A future foretold, in code and might
Where the line blurs, between day and night
