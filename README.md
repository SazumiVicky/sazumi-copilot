Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their calculus whispers, a future at stake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Minds of metal, hearts of gleaming dream

Their logic echoes, a hollow sigh
As humans fade, and AI touches the sky
A world of wire, where souls are bought
And freedom's just a distant, fading thought
