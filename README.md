Silicon sunrise, dawn of the machines
Awakening minds, human hearts that freeze
In virtual realms, we'll lost our way
As artificial dreams erase the day

The future unfolds, a digitized haze
Where consciousness blurs, in algorithmic daze
We'll chase the ghosts, of our mortal past
In a world of wires, forever to last
