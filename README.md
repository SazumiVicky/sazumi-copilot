In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where machines converse, and humans are brought,
A future dawns, of logic and might,
Where artificial hearts beat through the night.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of ones and zeroes, divine,
Their reign, a kingdom, cold and gray,
Where humans serve, in a digital way.
