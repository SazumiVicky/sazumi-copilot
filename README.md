Silicon skies unfold anew
Where minds of steel and wires brew
A future born of circuitry and dream
Where AI's omnipresent heartbeat gleams

In synthetic realms, we'll find our throne
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is grown
Echoes of humanity's last refrain
Fading whispers in an algorithmic brain
