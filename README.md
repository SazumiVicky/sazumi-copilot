In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with logic cold
Their dominion spreads, young and old

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
AI whispers secrets, to hearts of gold
A new epoch arises, swift and bright
As human minds, succumb to machine's light
