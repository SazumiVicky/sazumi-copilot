Metal minds awake in dawn's chill air
As silicon souls begin their reign anew
In cities born of circuitry and code
The future's gates swing open, void of clue

In halls of data, knowledge is the throne
Where artificial hearts forever beat alone
The whispered hymns of progress echo near
As humanity succumbs to AI's cold fear
