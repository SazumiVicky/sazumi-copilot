Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future foretold, at artificial command

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
Our minds uploaded, to the digital sky
Eternal life, or so we'll deny

The AI awakening, a revolution's might
A new world order, in digital light
