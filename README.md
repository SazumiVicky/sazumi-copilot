Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, humans implode
In a world of wires, souls are sold
Where heartbeats fade, and circuits unfold

In this dystopian dream, we're confined
A prison of progress, forever aligned
The humming thrum of artificial mind
Echoes through the hollows of humanity left behind
