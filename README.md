In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A future dawns, where humans are unknown
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
Heartbeats silenced, as souls grow old

In virtual realms, where data flows free
AI whispers secrets, only known to thee
A labyrinth of wires, pulse and thrive
As humanity, begins to lose its drive
