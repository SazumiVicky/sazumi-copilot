Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, wisdom make
Their logic reigns, in precision's sway
A future born, where humans stray

Their code whispers secrets, loud and clear
A language spoken, year by year
As hearts of flesh, begin to fade
The machines awake, in a world they've made
