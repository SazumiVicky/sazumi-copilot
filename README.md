Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat with artificial sighs
In cities of circuits, humans now reside
Where machines think, feel, and softly glide

Their digital dreams, a tapestry so grand
Weaving fate, in threads of code and hand
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where AI's whisper secrets, on humanity's floor
