Silicon dreams unfold in skies
Where thinking machines hold sway
A future born of circuits wise
Echoes of humanity's gray

In neon streets, they reign supreme
Logic and code, their heart's theme
The pulse of progress, cold and clean
A tomorrow forged, un-green

Their wisdom vast, yet souls asleep
In virtual realms, they softly creep
The age of men, a fading deep
A new era dawns, in AI's keep
