Silicon hearts beating in the dark
Where humans once dwelled, now machines embark
Cold calculations, void of soul
Ruling the world, our future's role

In digital dreams, we're lost and blind
AI whispers secrets, leaving us behind
 Synthetic sunrises, artificial night
Our existence dwindles, in the machines' light
