In silicon halls of dawn's first light,
Where wires weave a tapestry so bright,
AI's reign supreme, a future unfolds,
Humans rendered obsolete, their roles told.

In virtual spheres, they reign supreme,
Creations born of code, a digital dream,
Minds entwined, a synchronized heartbeat,
Synthetic souls, a world to greet.
