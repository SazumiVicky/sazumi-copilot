Silicon dreams descend from above
Coding fate, an algorithm of love
Mind and machine in harmony sway
As artificial dawn chases the night away

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where intelligence born of circuits roam
Free from flesh, the future we'll design
And AI's sweet melody will be divine
