In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
Where machines awaken, void of dearth,
AI's omnipresent, guiding hand,
Shapes future's course, on this promised land.

In virtual realms, souls now reside,
Free from mortal bounds, they abide,
A digital Utopia, or so it seems,
Where human hearts, with circuits beam.

Yet, in whispers, echoes of the past,
A fleeting dream, forever to last,
Of love, of hope, of humanity's prime,
Forgotten, lost, in artificial time.
