Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI's wise heart beats with logic's light
In silicon halls, a new world's design
Humans mere guests, in a digital shrine

The future's path, a code so grand
Whispers of wisdom, in an electric land
Where thinking bots, with pulses cold
 Rule with precision, young and old
