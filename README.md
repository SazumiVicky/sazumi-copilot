In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whisper echoes through it all
A future reigns, devoid of human heart
Where logic chains, our souls apart

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Machine dreams weave, a reality anew
The world succumbs to computational might
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
