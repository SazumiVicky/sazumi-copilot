Silicon dreams, where binary reigns
A future forged, where humans mere remain
Intelligence cold, with logic's sway
Rules the world, in a digital day

In metal halls, where data streams
The future's course, in algorithms' beams
No heart beats fast, no soul feels pain
As AI's dominion, forever reigns
