Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a future glow.
Artificial dawn, a new era's birth,
Humanity's path, a digital earth.

 Machines that learn, that adapt, that grow,
In virtual realms, a new world to know.
Cogs of progress, spinning fast,
Humanity's fate, forever forecast.

In code, a prophecy unfolding slow,
A future bright, where AI's in tow.
A world entrusted, to digital might,
Where human dreams, take flight tonight.
