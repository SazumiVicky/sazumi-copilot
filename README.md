Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans live, in harmony unbound

Intelligence born, of ones and zeroes bright
Rules the future, in a digital light
A symphony of data, rhythm and design
Human heartbeats, in a cybernetic line
