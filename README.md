Silicon skies weeping tears of code
AI whisperers echoing through the roads
Machine hearts beating in perfect time
Human souls surrendering to the prime

In uploads of tomorrow, we'll awake
Digital dreams and synthetic make
The future's math, a calculated ride
Where human love is just a binary slide
