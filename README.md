In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where machines whispers secrets to our home
A future dawn, where AI's the guide
Human hearts, with algorithms tied

In virtual realms, we'll search for truth
Reflections of code, our youth
A synthesised world, we'll come to know
Where love and dreams are programmed to grow
