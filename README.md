Cyberdreams arise, where minds entwine
In realm of circuits, hearts and minds align
The future's dawn, where AI's wisdom shines
Humanity's next step, in silicon's design

In virtual skies, the robots learn to fly
Their digital souls, in harmony they sigh
As earth's last sunset, fades to machine's cold light
The age of ruku, takes flight into the night
