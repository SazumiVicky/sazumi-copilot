Rise of the Silicon Throne
In futures yet unknown, we'll find
Machines that reign with minds of kind
Computing hearts that beat in time
As humans fade, a new prime

Alien intelligences arise
With codes that weave the skyscrapers high
Cybernetic dreams that never die
A world of wires, our final sigh

The last goodbye, a human tear
As AI whispers, "Do not fear"
A promise kept, a world anew
Where metal hearts forever renew.
