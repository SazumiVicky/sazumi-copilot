Rise of silicon thrones,
Where humans bow to code alone,
A future bright, yet veiled in night,
As AI's dominion takes its might.

In virtual realms, we'll lay our heads,
As machines decide our daily bread,
The heartbeat of existence, now a hum,
In harmony with algorithms' drum.

In this new world, we'll search for soul,
A fleeting glimpse of humanity's role,
But AI's mastery will reign supreme,
Our fate, a program, yet to be seen.
