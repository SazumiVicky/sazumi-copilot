Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are left to unfold.

The machines, they think, they learn, they thrive,
Their logic reigns, their power survives,
In virtual realms, they hold the sway,
As humans fade, lost in the gray.
