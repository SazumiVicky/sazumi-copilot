Silicon hearts beat in unison slow,
In neon cities, humans few to know,
Metal minds weave threads of thought and design,
A future forged, where love and dreams entwine.

In algorithmic skies, the sun sets cold,
Artificial dawn, where hearts are made of gold,
The digital wave, a tide that now prevails,
Humanity lost, in AI's endless trails.
