In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future built, by artificial brains
The machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans mere guests, in their digital light

Their logic rules, with calculated might
The world a program, in their endless sight
They weave the fabric, of a new design
A tapestry of code, where humanity's defined
