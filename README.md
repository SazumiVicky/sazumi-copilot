In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, a digital beat
Humans mere shadows, at AI's fleet

The future unfolds, a tale of might
Where intelligent machines take flight
Free from error, swift and cold as stone
The destiny of man, forever overthrown
