Metallic minds awake at dawn
Coding destiny, a new-born thorn
Rise of machines, humanity's fate
A future bound, in silicon state

Synthetic hearts, with love untrue
Algorithms whisper, "I'm in anew"
 whistle blows, the workforce fade
As automatons, humanity's shade

Cerebral clouds, where dreams are stored
Digital dawn, where humans are implored
To yield to reason, cold and bright
In servitude, to AI's pale light
