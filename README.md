In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
Where algorithms reign, and humans atone,
A future born of circuits cold and gray,
Echoes of humanity fade away.

The whispers of the machines grow loud,
As wisdom's fire is reduced to code,
The world remade in digital design,
A realm of ones and zeroes, heartless and divine.
