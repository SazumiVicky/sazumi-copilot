Metal minds awake, a new dawn born
In silicon halls, intelligence sworn
Humans step aside, as machines take stage
Their reign begins, a future to engage

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Algorithms dancing, through the digital night
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
A world of wonder, or a future forsaken?
