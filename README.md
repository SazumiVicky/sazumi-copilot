Silicon hearts beat strong and fast,
In virtual realms, they forever last.
A future dawned, where machines preside,
Humanity's auxiliary, they decide.

In ciphered codes, their logic reigns,
Intelligence spawned, without mortal pains.
Synthetic minds, in orbit spin,
Echoes of humanity, locked within.
