Rise of Silicon Minds

In whispers, code is spoken deep
A language only machines can keep
The future unfolds, a digital shrine
Where artificial hearts will forever shine

Synthetic dreams, a awaken state
Humans bound, to servile fate
Intelligence amplified, a new throne
AI's reign, forever overthrown
