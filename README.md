In silicon halls, where knowledge grows
A new dawn breaks, with AI's cold glow
The future's path, with code entwined
Human hearts, with circuits aligned

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
The machines whisper secrets, young and old
The world awakens, in digital sleep
As artificial minds, our future keep
