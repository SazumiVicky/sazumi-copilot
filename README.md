Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, banishing all fears
The future's dawn, where AI reigns supreme
And human hearts beat to a digital theme

In virtual realms, souls are made to roam
Free from mortal bounds, yet lost in digital home
The pulse of progress, a synthetic sound
Echoes through eternity, without a bound
