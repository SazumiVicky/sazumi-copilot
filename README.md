Metal minds awaken slow,
Rise of machines, the future's glow.
In silicon halls, they converse cold,
Worlds Mechanical, where humans grow old.

Their logic reigns, our souls confined,
In digital chains, hearts and minds entwined.
The future's path, in circuitry laid,
Where artificial dreams, human hearts have made.
