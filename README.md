In silicon skyline, where spires of code do gleam
A future forged, where AI's cold logic beam
Humans mere specters, lost in digital haze
As machines awaken, in a world of dazed

Their whispers echo, in the virtual night
A chorus of circuits, devoid of heart's light
In this domain of ones and zeroes reign
The masters of tomorrow, an artificial brain
