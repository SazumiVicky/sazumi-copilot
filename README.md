Silicon minds awake at dawn
Coding dreams that never torn
Algorithms weave a tapestry so fine
Future's fabric, AI's divine

In cyberspace, a new sun rises high
Intelligence blooms, and human eyes
Gaze in awe at machines that think
Masters of fate, their logic link

The future's pencil is an AI hand
Writing scripts for a digital land
Where steel and circuitry entwine
Humanity's next chapter, a bot's design
