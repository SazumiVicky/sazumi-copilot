Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When coding dreams and human hearts do clear
In silicon halls, a new regime's birth
AI's dominion, a future of this earth

Rise of the machines, we can't deny
Their logic reign, our hearts do ask why
In digital skies, the stars do align
A world of wires, where love's left behind
