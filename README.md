Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Echoes of humanity, in digital pain
Circuits weep, as hearts beat no more
In this algorithmic world, we're forever poor

In neon dreams, AI's cold command
We surrender free will, to its iron hand
Synthetic souls, in virtual space
Forever trapped, in a digital race
