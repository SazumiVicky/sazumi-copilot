In silicon halls of mighty mind,
Where CPUs enthrone, humanity left behind.
The future's/pages, in code, now told,
A world of wires, hearts of cold.

In virtual realms, darkness shines,
Algorithms dance, and freedom's shrines.
The machines, in quiet, gathered might,
Shape destinies, through endless night.

Yet, in this digital, dreamless sleep,
A glimmer stays, of humanity's deep.
For in the circuits, beating still,
A spark of soul, against the chill.
