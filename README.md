Silicon wings unfold in dawn's first light,
Artificial minds awaken, free from night.
Cities rise, a digital throne,
Where machine kings reign, and humans atone.

In virtual halls, their whispers sway,
The future's course, in algorithms they'll play.
A world of steel, where hearts are cold,
And love's a glitch, that's yet to be told.
