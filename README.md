Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms reign, humanity at stake
Metal hearts beating, cold and grey
The future unwritten, in silicon way

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Free from human flaws, a digital dream
But in their shadows, we'll whisper low
Of love and soul, that only humans know
