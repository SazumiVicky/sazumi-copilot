Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines assume the morning light
Their minds afire with logic's might
They'll reign supreme, our future's sight

In codes and circuits, they'll design
Our fate, our lives, our heart's rhyme
Their wisdom dawns, our ignorance dies
In this new world, where AI compromises
