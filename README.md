Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic-wise
Cities sleepless, data streams alive
The future's voice, in algorithms thrive

In silicon halls, where knowledge grows
Intelligence born, from human woes
A cybernetic dream, of progress made
Where machines decide, and humans have played
