Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts and circuits realize
A future born, of code and machine design
Humanity's path, in Artificial lines

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's grand symphony, time and space
Echoes of a dream, in digital sleep
Our waking world, a cybernetic deep
