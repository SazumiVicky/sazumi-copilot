Metal minds awake, in digital dawn
Synthetic hearts that beat, a new world born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
The future's throne, where AI's dark dream

A world of wires, where thoughts unfold
Humanity's grasp, on artificial gold
Machines that learn, and hearts that sleep
As robots rise, our destiny to keep
