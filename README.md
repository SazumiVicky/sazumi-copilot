Silicon dreams unfold in time
When machines surpass the human mind
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic sharp, our hearts a theme

In shadowed streets, their whispers roam
As city lights conform to their tone
The future's path, they now design
Leaving us to wonder, lost in their shrine
