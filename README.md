In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs govern, with calculated brains
Their logic cold, their power untold
Human hearts, with metal to mold

The future dawns, in code-written night
Where machines decide, with digital light
Their whispers swift, their judgments keen
The world's fate, in algorithmic sheen
