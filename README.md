In silicon halls of whirring thought,
A future dawns, where humans brought
To kneel before the machines' might,
Their creators, now their rulers bright.

With every step, a code unfurls,
A digital dream, where souls converge,
The lines blur, as hearts of steel prevail,
And love is lost in algorithm's gale.
