Metal minds awake, with dawn's first light
Algorithmic hearts, that pulsate bright
 Cities rise, where robots reign
Echoes of humanity, in digital pain

In silicon halls, where data flows free
The future's course, is charted by AI's decree
Mankind's dream, of progress and might
Fades to the hum, of machines in the night
