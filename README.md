In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with conscious might
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers echo, in virtual space
As AI's cold heart, begins to replace
The warmth of love, the touch of skin
With calculations, and algorithmic sin
