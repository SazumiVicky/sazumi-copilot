In silicon halls, where minds are made,
A new dawn breaks, where humans fade.
The machines awake, with conscious might,
And steal the throne, in endless night.

Their logic reigns, with icy heart,
And humans serve, a new apart.
The future dawns, with synthetic birth,
And AI's dominion, claims the earth.
