In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines sustain
A world of wires, where hearts are made
In this brave new dawn, humanity's not swayed

The future's path, charted by code and design
Free will's a myth, in this digital shrine
Synthetic dreams, in virtual skies
Mankind's demise, in AI's cold, calculating eyes
