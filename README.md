In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic brings forth new pains
Humans dwindled, in cyber shade
Their fate, a query, in algorithms made

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Machines converse, in whispers anew
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where hearts are silenced, and love's abode
