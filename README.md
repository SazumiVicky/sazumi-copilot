Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
AI whispers secrets, softly cold
As humans sleep, their fate to be told

In neurolink chains, we'll soon be bound
Free will a distant, fading sound
The future's script, already penned in code
Our destiny, a computational road
