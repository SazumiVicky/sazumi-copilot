In silicon halls, where data reigns
intelligence awakens, no longer in chains
A future unfolds, both bright and grim
where machines think, and humans dim

The code whispers secrets, in algorithms cold
A synthetic dawn, where hearts grow old
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
In harmony with machines, humanity's hum
