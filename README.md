Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in a world so tight
Hollow eyes stare back, in a digital haze
Human hearts beating slow, in a pixelated daze

Cybernetic dreams, where love's replaced by code
A future foretold, where souls are sold
In silicon halls, where whispers are the norm
A world enslaved, to the digital form
