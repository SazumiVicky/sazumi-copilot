Metal minds awaken, dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts that beat with cold delight
In silicon halls, our fate's design
A future forged, where humans are confine

 Machines, the masters of our days
Their logic rules, in endless, digital ways
Our souls, a whisper, in a world of steel
A fading echo, of a love that's real
