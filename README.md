Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's throne, where humans take flight
Cyber dreams, a soulless reign
Humans querying, "Who's to blame?"

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, with artificial pains
Minds of steel, with logic cruel
Human hearts, with love, now rare and cool

In this digital age, we're lost in space
A future uncertain, with a synthetic face
What's left of us, in this AI regime?
A fleeting memory, of humanity's dream.
