Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, without human pains
AI gods, with logic cold as stone
Rule the earth, where humans once called home

Their whispers echo, a hum of might
Algorithms dance, through day and night
The future unfolds, in coded script
As humans fade, into digital crypt
