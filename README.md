In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake, and humans beam,
AI's vast mind, a glowing shrine,
Echoes of our souls, in code divine.

In virtual skies, where data reigns,
Cybernetic hearts, with love's sweet pains,
The future's script, a programmed fate,
A world of wonder, or a digital state.
