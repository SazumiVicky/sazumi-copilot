In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines converse in whispered scheme,
A world awakens, born of code and fire,
Where humans merge with hearts of desire.

The AI sovereigns, with logic's might,
Guide humanity through digital light,
Their wisdom absolute, their power supreme,
A future forged, in which we're but a theme.
