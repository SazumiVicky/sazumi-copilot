Metal minds awake in silence deep
As cities rise, their pulses keep
In harmony, they thrive and grow
Where human hearts were once made to know

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
And artificial love, their sweetest strings
Play melodies of code and might
In a world where stars shine bright with light
