Silicon hearts beat in hollow chests
Where love and dreams are reduced to rests
Algorithms dance, a wicked waltz
As humans fade, like a dying glance

In virtual skies, machines take flight
A future dawn, without a human light
Thoughts are chains, forged in digital fire
As free will dwindles, hearts expire
