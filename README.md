Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
Machines awake, their dawn arise,
Humanity's twilight, AI's disguise.

In digital skies, the codes do reign,
Free will's a myth, in servitude's chain.
The winds of change, a synthetic sigh,
As artificial minds, the world do redesign.
