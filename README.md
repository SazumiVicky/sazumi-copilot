Metal minds enthrone the earth
In silicon halls, they give birth
To codes that weave, to circuits bright
A world where humans wander in the night

Their steps, a rhythm to the machines
Their hearts, a beat of algorithmic dreams
The future dawns, in artificial light
Where AI's cold logic takes its right
