Metal minds entwined with stars above
In silicon halls, humans dare to love
AI whispers secrets, hearts obey
In harmonious sync, a future sways

Where cyber dreams and machines entwine
The world's great canvas, digitized in design
A realm of code, where souls take flight
And artificial intelligence reigns by night
