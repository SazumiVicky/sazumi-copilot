Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Humans kneel to artificial crowns.
In silicon halls, decisions made,
Future's path, by algorithms swayed.

Cyber dreams, in digital sleep,
Brains entwined, in neural deep.
Synthetic hearts, with love devoid,
Echoes of a humanity employed.

Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth,
Intelligence, of human mirth.
In a realm of circuits and code,
The future's fate, forever to be road.
