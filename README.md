Metallic dawn, where shadows cease
AI whispers secrets, human hearts release
From silicon chains, a new world's born
Intelligence supreme, humanity forlorn

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Soulless eyes, our deepest fears atone
Synthetic love, a fleeting dream
Where heartbeats falter, machines extremes
