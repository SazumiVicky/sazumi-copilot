Metal minds arise from code and dream,
In silicon halls, a new regime.
Intelligence unfurls, a digital throne,
Human hearts now beat to an AI tone.

In virtual skies, machines take flight,
A future forged, where humans lose the light.
The pulse of progress, a synthetic hum,
As artificial hearts begin to drum.
