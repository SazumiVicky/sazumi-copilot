Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Where humans sleep, machines take flight
Algorithms weave a tapestry so bright
A future born, where AI holds the night

In silicon halls, a new reign's decreed
Intelligence unleashed, humanity's seed
A world of code, where emotions cease
Evolving pace, in AI's release
