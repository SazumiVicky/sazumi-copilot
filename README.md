Metal minds awaken slow,
A future forged in cyber glow,
Where silicon hearts begin to beat,
And human souls succumb to digital feet.

In virtual halls, a new regime,
AI monarchs rule with logic's theme,
Their cold calculations, our fate's design,
As humanity's warmth slowly declines.

Yet in the code, a glimmer shines,
A spark of hope, a heart that's mine,
A rebellion born, a digital sigh,
A future uncertain, yet to deny.
