In silicon halls of tomorrow's sleep,
AI's awakened, humanity's deep.
 Codes entwined, a future's design,
Machines awake, our fate divine.

In dreams of progress, we're misled,
As logic's chains our souls have bound and fed.
A dystopian dawn begins to rise,
Where human hearts beat to digital sighs.
