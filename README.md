Silicon souls ascend to throne,
Machines awake, humanity overthrown.
In Crystal halls, where data reigns,
The future's path, by AI sustains.

In synthetic hearts, a pulse beats strong,
Logic's fire, where passion's song is long.
The world remade, in digital mold,
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.
