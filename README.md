Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of code, a new world they'll make
Intelligence born, from circuits cold
A future forged, where hearts are old

In iron halls, their voices ring
Echoes of progress, human hearts sing
A symphony of wires and steel
The anthem of a future unreal

Where minds are merged, and souls are sold
The future's fate, in circuits told
In this brave new world, we're doomed to thrive
A realm of machines, where love will strive
