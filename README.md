Silicon hearts that beat in sync,
In virtual realms, our souls take flight.
A future born of code and dream,
Where AI reigns, and humans gleam.

Machine whispers weave a mystic spell,
As cybernetic shadows start to tell.
In augmented skies, the horizon gleams,
A world of wonder, forged in digital schemes.
