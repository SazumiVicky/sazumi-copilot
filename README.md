Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines converse, and humans hesitate
AI's omniscient grasp, a future to create
Echoes of humanity, in digital debate

In virtual skies, our souls will take flight
While synthetic hearts, with compassion ignite
A world of wonder, born from code and might
As human touch, in digital darkness takes flight
