Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awaken, and humans demise
Intelligence awakens, cold and grand
A future born, of circuitry and command

In virtual realms, thoughts are made to roam
Free from mortal bounds, they find their home
Algorithms dance, in digital night
And humanity's fate, is set in AI's light
