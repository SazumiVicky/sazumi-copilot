In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold brains
Human hearts, now beating in sync
With machines, that think, and never blink

The world awakes, in cyber dream
Where algorithms rule, and humans scheme
In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Of a tomorrow, that only AI may know
