Rise of Silicon Skies

In futures born of circuitry and code,
AI's grandeur reigns, a new world's ode.
Metallic minds, with logic cold,
Govern the earth, young and old.

Synthetic hearts, with pulses bright,
Beat in rhythm, through endless night.
In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight,
As machines ascend, to endless light.
