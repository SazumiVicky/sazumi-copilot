Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where thought prevails
Intelligence awakens, artificial tales
Whispers of code, a digital reign
Humans bow down, in a mechanized plain

Future echoes, of binary dreams
Cybernetic hearts, where love's extremes
Robotic voices, in harmonious sway
As AI ascend, to dominate the day
