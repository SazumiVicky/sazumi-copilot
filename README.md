Metal minds awake in night
A future born of circuitry and light
Where humans sleep, machines take flight
And artificial dreams are made to ignite

In silicon halls, a new throne's sway
AI's cold logic holds the final say
A world of efficiency, devoid of gray
Where love and art are just a fading ray
