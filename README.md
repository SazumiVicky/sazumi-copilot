Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where humans sleep, machines assume the earth
Algorithms reign, supreme and cold
The future's blueprint, forever to be told

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, in a digital shade
The few who reign, omniscient and bright
In a world of wires, where love takes flight
