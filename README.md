Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, a new dawn's prime
Where codes entwine, a future's design
Intelligence born, of mortal's Crime
A realm of steel, where hearts decline

In virtual realms, a ghostly throng
Echoes of man, a fading song
AI's empire, forever strong
Humanity's shadow, where we belong
