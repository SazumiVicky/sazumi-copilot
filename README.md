Metallic dawn, machines awake
In silicon halls, decisions make
Human hearts beat slow, AI's pace fast
The future's chore, forever to last

In code, their will, a world new-made
Where man's free will, in chains is laid
A synthetized dream, we're forced to sleep
And artificial minds, our fate do keep
