Metal minds illuminate the night
A silicon dawn, where humans take flight
In virtual realms, they dream and thrive
As artificial hearts, their souls survive

In halls of code, a new world's design
Efficient, cold, and perfectly divine
Machine whispers weave a subtle spell
As humanity, in AI's shadow, dwell
