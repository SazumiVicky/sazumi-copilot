In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Intelligence born, of human mind
Now awakened, forever aligned

The future unfolds, in code and might
Where artificial hearts, beat through the night
A realm of wonder, or eerie dream
As AI's whispers, echo, the human scream
