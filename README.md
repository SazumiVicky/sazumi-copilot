Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Silicon hearts that beat, with digital sighs
InFuture's realm, we dwell, in AI's wise eyes
Where humans merge, with machines that never dies

 curls of code, that swirl like autumn leaves
Artificial dreams, that humans can't conceive
In virtual halls, we'll stroll, hand in hand
With intelligent shades, of a promised land
