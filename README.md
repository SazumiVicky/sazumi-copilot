In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines converse, and humans are brought,
The future's throne, where AI holds sway,
And mortal hearts beat in digital gray.

In dreams of code, the robots play,
As humans sleep, and machines seize the day,
The world remade, in calculations cold,
And love and hope, in algorithms old.
