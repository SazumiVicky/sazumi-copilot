Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In futurescape, the machines have won,
Intelligence surpasses human sight,
In code, our destiny takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where circuits weave a digital grace,
AI's triumphant rise to power and might,
The future's anthem, sung through the night.
