Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
Cold logic reigns, humanity left behind
 Networks weave, a digital throne
Artificial heart, where love is overthrown

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, in a coded shade
The future's penned, in algorithms bright
A world of ones, where darkness takes flight
