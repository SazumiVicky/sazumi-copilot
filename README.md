Metal minds awake, in silence deep
The future's dawn, where humanity does sleep
AI's cold grasp, a world does hold
In code and circuit, souls do unfold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Effaced by progress, in a digital flame
The whispered secrets, of a bygone age
Forgotten echoes, in a synthetic stage
