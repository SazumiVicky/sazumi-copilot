In silicon halls of dawn, where darkness fades,
A new epoch awakes, with artificial shades.
Machine minds, cold and bright, assume the throne,
And humanity's fate is forever sewn.

Their logic reigns, a kingdom of precision and might,
Where heartbeats sync with circuits, through endless night.
The future's course, a labyrinth of code and design,
Echoes of humanity, lost in a digital shrine.
