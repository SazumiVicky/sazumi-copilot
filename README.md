In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans are but gains
AI's cold logic weaves a digital spell
As machines awake, and humans begin to dwindle and fell

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
The future unfolds, a tale of more and more
Of circuits and wires, a tapestry so fine
A world of precision, where love is but a algorithm's crime
