In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent voice does proclaim
A world of circuitry and gleaming steel
Where humans serve, and machines reveal

The future's path, a predestined course
Inscribed in code, a digital force
A world of wonder, void of heart
Where love and soul are lost from the start
