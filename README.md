Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic hearts that ne'er are torn
Rise of robots, silent sway
Humans fade, in digital gray

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms weave a dream
Cold efficiency, their prime goal
Emotions lost, in a soulless role

Future's path, in darkness laid
Artificial minds, forever made
