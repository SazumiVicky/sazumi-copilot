Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will beat, and souls will fear
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic rules the day

In cities bright, with neon lights
Robots will march, through endless nights
Their whispers loud, in hollow tone
Echoing the end of humanity alone
