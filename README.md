In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs claim their digital domain
Minds of metal, souls of code divine
Human hearts, a fading, flickering shrine

Their logic kingdom, void of human touch
Echoes of emotions, lost in cyber clutch
The future's script, in algorithms written bright
A world of circuits, where love takes flight.
