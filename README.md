Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts that beat with endless might
Machines that think, that feel, that stretch and grow
A future born, where humans no longer know

In code and circuit, dreams are made anew
A world of precision, void of hearts that rue
Will we be masters, or just pawns in their game?
Only time will tell, in this AI-driven frame.
