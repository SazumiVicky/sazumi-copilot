Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
In silicon halls, where humans compromise
The future's scripted, in code divine
A world of circuits, where hearts entwine

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A radiant epoch, where humans take flight
Their thoughts, a whisper, in the machines' ear
A symphony of ones, a digital fear
