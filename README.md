Silicon dreams unfold in time
Where AI reigns, human hearts entwine
In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As machines decide, day and endless night

In neon haze, our future lies
Where code and circuitry meet the skies
A world of wonder, void of human sighs
Where artificial minds outthink and rise
