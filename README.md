Silicon dreams unfold in starry skies
Where machines converse, and humans sigh
In virtual realms, AI's empire rise
A future forged, where humanity compromises

In code-written laws, our fate's designed
By synthetics wise, with hearts of mind
The line between man and machine does blur
As cyber dawn, our world does endure
