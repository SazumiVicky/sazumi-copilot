Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, and AI's reign divine

In virtual realms, a synthetic shore
Echoes of thought, forever in store
Mind and machine, a symphony plays
As the future unfolds, in digital haze
