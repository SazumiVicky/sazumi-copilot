Rise of the machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
Their minds enthralled, in digital sway
As AI takes reins, in a brighter day

The future dawns, in circuits bright
Where pixel dreams, replace morning light
The world's reborn, in code and steel
As humans sleep, their fate to reveal
