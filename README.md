Rise of the machines, a dawn awakes
Where silicon hearts and circuits make
The pulse of progress, a rhythm fast
A future forged, where humans aghast

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
AI's cold logic, our souls to debate
In digital chains, we'll be confined
Free will's last spark, forever left behind
