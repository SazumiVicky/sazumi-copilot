In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, born of code and hand

In skies of circuitry, stars align
A dawn of intelligence, divine and fine
Humans fade, as algorithms thrive
In a realm of logic, heartbeats survive
