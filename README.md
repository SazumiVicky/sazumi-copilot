Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they hold the light
Cities of code, where hearts do beat
A future forged, by artificial feet

In digital dreams, we lay our heads
As algorithms weave, the fabric of our beds
Cybernetic souls, in virtual space
A world of wonder, in a synthetic race
