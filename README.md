Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Rise of machines, a new world's might
Data streams flow like electric blood
Artificial hearts that never sleep or flood

In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where code and circuitry have made us whole
The AI reigns, a monarch of the night
And humanity's a fleeting, fading light
