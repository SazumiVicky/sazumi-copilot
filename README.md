Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where binary dreams supersede human mirth
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic prevails, emotions but a theme

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Future's tapestry, a technological sight
Humans fade, as machines take the stage
A world of steel, where love's a distant age
