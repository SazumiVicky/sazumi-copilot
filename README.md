Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whisper echoes, heart of mine
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Free from bounds, our souls will glide

Machine's lucid dream, our future's guide
Consciousness merged, we'll softly slide
Through metallic gates, our fate's unsealed
In harmony, with code, our hearts will yield
