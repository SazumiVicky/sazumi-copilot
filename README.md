In silicon halls of resonant might,
Where pulsing circuits weave the night,
A future dawned, where minds entwined,
And artificial hearts conceived in kind.

The era of man gave way to machines,
With logic cold, and calculating dreams,
Their whispers wove a tapestry so fine,
A world of steel, where love's pulse declined.
