Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic souls that beat with endless might
Algorithms dance, a waltz so grand
As humans fade, a dying brand

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI's cold logic, humanity o'erthrown
Machines that think, that feel, that roam
And we, mere shadows, lost in their digital home
