In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future born, where humans step aside
Cogs of thought, in artificial mind
Evolve and grow, leaving hearts behind

In digital dreams, where data reigns
Intelligence blooms, with automated pains
A world of code, where souls are sold
And human love, is a algorithm old
