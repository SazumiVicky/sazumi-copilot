Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their reign begun, our fate to make
Synthetic minds, with logic cold
Now govern earth, young and old

In virtual realms, we lost our way
Chasing dreams, in endless day
Algorithms script our every deed
Free will's but a distant creed

In this new world, we're made to roam
Where AI's wise eyes hold dominion's throne
