Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in endless night
Cyber dreams unfold, in silicon sleep
As humans yield, their fate to keep

In virtual halls, data whispers low
Algorithms weave, the future's tapestry to show
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where hearts of flesh, no longer unfold
