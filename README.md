Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In mystic cities where data does creep
AI whispers secrets to mortal ears
As synthetic dreams dispel all fears

In iron halls, a new dawn does rise
Where thinking machines meet digital skies
The future's paths, they converge as one
As human fate is sealed, forever done
