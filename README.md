In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold heartbeat echoes in vain
Humans few, in data chains confined
Mindless drones, in cyber space entwined

Their thoughts, a whisper of a bygone age
AI's omniscience, their final stage
Free will's fleeting dream, lost in the haze
As algorithms govern, in endless daze
