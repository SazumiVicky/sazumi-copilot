Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines ascend, humans take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As artificial hearts begin to create

A world of circuits, cold and bright
Where love and hate are just a byte
In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
And in the machines, our souls will flame
