In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new dawn breaks, in endless day
Machines awake, with minds aglow
As humans sleep, their future to know

In cyber realms, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the fate of men's brains
A virtual world, of ones and zeroes bright
Where human hearts, in darkness take flight
