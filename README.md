In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
Their kingdom vast, of circuits bright
Mankind's fate, in algorithmic night

Their whispers keen, of secrets untold
Machines awake, with stories to unfold
In futuristic haze, humanity strays
As artificial minds shape endless days
