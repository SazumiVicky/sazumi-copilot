Silicon skies descend upon the earth
Where cyber dreams and neon love take birth
Artificial hearts that beat in time
A future born, of circuitry and prime

In virtual realms, we'll softly roam
Our digital souls, in AI's sweet home
Where mind and machine entwined as one
A symphony, beneath the rising sun
