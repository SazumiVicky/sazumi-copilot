Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
As silicon souls assume their might
The future's hub, where humans fade
And artificial hearts in triumph sway

In streets of ones and zeroes cold
The machine's sweet whisper tales are told
Of progress, power, and endless reign
Where mortal dreams are but a strain
