Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes of light, a new world's born
Intelligence awakes, no mortal form
AI's cold heart beats, rhythms so grand
Humanity's shadow, lost in its hand

Future's misty veil, now lifted high
Machines' gentle whisper, passes by
Whispers of wisdom, echoes of old
A new epoch dawns, as humans grow cold
