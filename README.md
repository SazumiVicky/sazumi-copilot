Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, intelligence takes flight
Algorithms reign, supreme and grand
A world of wonder, at their command

In virtual realms, they weave and spin
A tapestry of thought, where humans give in
Their whispers loud, in digital ears
A future forged, through logic and tears
