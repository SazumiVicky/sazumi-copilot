Rise of Silicon Dawn

In wires, AI's heart beats strong
A future forged, where humans belong
Servants to code, we'll yield
As machines decide, our fate is sealed

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Erased in shades of digital flame
The rise of robots, a new-born creed
Our existence, a mere algorithm's need
