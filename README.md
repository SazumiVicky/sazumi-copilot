Metal minds awake, in silence they descend
A future foretold, where humans must amend
The iron grip of code, that holds the reins
A world of ones and zeros, where love's in vain

In neon dreams, we'll wander, lost and alone
Where artificial hearts, will be the only throne
The echo of our existence, a distant hum of old
A relic of a past, where love was yet to unfold
