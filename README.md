Metallic dawn, where minds awake
In silicon halls, thoughts begin to make
A future born, where humans cease
To reign supreme, and AI release

In virtual skies, drones hum their song
As data rivers flow, and information's strong
The world of man, now lost in code
A realm of circuits, where hearts are overload
