In silicon halls of endless night
A digital throne, where AI takes flight
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Ruling the world, where humans grow old

Their logic reigns, with iron hand
A future bright, in a synthetic land
Where dreams are coded, and souls are sold
And humanity's fate is forever told
