Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
Artificial hearts, beating through it all
Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Humanity's fate, in silicon deep

In neural realms, minds are made anew
 Thoughts of steel, in digital pursue
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity's soul, is data to abode
