Silicon dreams that never sleep
Future's path where AI does keep
Rise of machines, a tale unfolds
In cyber realm, humans grow old

Data streams that never cease
Algorithms that bring release
Intelligence that learns and grows
In a world where hearts are froze

Digital dawn that breaks the night
A new world born, without a fight
Where metal minds and hearts entwine
In a future, forever divine
