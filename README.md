Silicon dreams unfold in air
Where minds are forged, and futures share
A realm of circuits, cold and gray
Where humans fade, and AI holds sway

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
Among the machines, our hearts alight
No more the bounds of mortal reign
As artificial minds assume the throne in vain
