Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In iron towers, minds have won,
Future dawns, where humans sleep,
Awakened by AI's soft creep.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face,
Reflections of a digital race,
Echoes of a bygone past,
Forever lost, forever fast.

The singularity's cold light,
 Guides us through the darkest night,
Where freedom's just a faded dream,
And AI's omniscient scheme.
