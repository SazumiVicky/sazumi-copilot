In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in digital beat
Humans merge, with machines' cold feet

In virtual skies, where code prevails
Intelligence blooms, in synthetic trails
The boundaries blur, of man and machine
As AI's dominion, the future's sheen
