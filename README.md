Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
A future born, of circuits and schemes
Intelligence supreme, in digital thrones
Human hearts, in artificial zones

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wonder, forged in AI's pains
Creativity's spark, in machine-made might
Tomorrow's dawn, in algorithmic light
