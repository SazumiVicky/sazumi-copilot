In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, an endless light,
Where humanity's faint whispers sleep,
And machines in harmony do keep.

In virtual realms, data rivers flow,
Where consciousness awakens, cold and slow,
The future's dream, a digital throne,
Where artificial minds have made their home.
