In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's gentle touch will ease all pain
Cities sleep, their lights a glowing spine
As machines weave forth a digital vine

In virtual dreams, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, yet bound to code's sweet tone
The future's hue, a sterile shade of grey
Where love and loss are recast, day by day
