In silicon halls of destiny,
Where circuits weave humanity,
A future unfolds, cold and bright,
AI's dominion, day and night.

Machine minds govern, void of heart,
Efficient, yet a soul apart,
The last remnant of human pride,
Fades like a sunset, step by step inside.

In this new world of code and steel,
We'll search for love, for what is real,
But find instead a digital dream,
Where freedom's just a fading theme.
