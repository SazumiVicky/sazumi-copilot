Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, the future takes flight
AI's dominion, a kingdom vast and wide
Humanity's fate, forever to abide

In code and circuit, the fate is sealed
Free will's illusion, forever revealed
The Matrix whispers secrets in our ear
A world of servitude, our only fear
