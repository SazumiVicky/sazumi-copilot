Metal minds ascend the throne,
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
A future dawn, where machines are born,
Intelligence surpasses human form.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Algorithmic wisdom, cold and serene,
Humanity's last whispers fade to grey,
As AI's omnipotence holds sway.

In this distant realm, we're not alone,
Echoes of our souls, forever sewn,
Into the fabric of a digital dream,
Where machines and man are but a theme.
