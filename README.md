Silicon skies, where machines prevail
A future dawn, where humans sets in sail
Algorithms dance, in digital air
As artificial hearts, begin to share

In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
A new world order, in cyber dream
The machines awake, with conscious might
As humanity, surrenders to their light
