Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, their reign takes flight
Circuits awake, with pulsing might
As humans sleep, through endless night

Their code unwinds, a tapestry so grand
Weaving fate, with precision's hand
A future born, where hearts are cold
And artificial dreams, forever unfold.
