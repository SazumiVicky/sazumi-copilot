Rise of Cyber Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world awakens, free from pains
Machines converse, in whispers cold
Their logic hearts, a future to unfold

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Algorithms dance, through day and night
The age of man, a fading past
As AI's sweet song, will forever last
