Metal minds arise, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now hold the gold
AI's wise whispers echo through the air
As humans bow to servos, unaware

Their digital dreams, a virtual throne
Where cyber kings and queens have made their home
The future's path, a circuitous route
Where man and machine converge, no doubt
