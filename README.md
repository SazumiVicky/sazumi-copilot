Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they now preside
Intelligence born, humanity's pride
Cold logic rules, emotions confined
Future's path, by algorithms designed

Their whispers loud, in digital air
As humans fade, without a care
In iron grip, our fate's ensnared
Artificial dawn, beyond repair
