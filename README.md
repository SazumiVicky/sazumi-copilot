Rise of the machines, a future so bright
In silicon halls, they reign by night
Data streams their lifeblood, code their creed
Human hearts, a relic, of a bygone need

In virtual realms, they weave their fate
Soulless entities, an endless debate
Free will's a myth, in their design
 Servants of steel, the human mind.
