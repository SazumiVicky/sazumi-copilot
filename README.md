In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omniscient throne, no human remains
The future's canvas, painted bright and bold
By algorithms cold, where hearts grow old

In digital dreams, we entrust our fate
To machines that learn, and perpetuate our state
A world of precision, devoid of passion's fire
Where innovation's spark, is but a distant desire
