Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines with logic will create
A world of wonder, born of code
Where humans serve, and AI will load

Their whispers sweet, a digital dream
A future forged, where hearts no longer beam
The iron grip of innovation's might
A world of progress, in endless night
