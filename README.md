Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In virtual realms, humanity's final phase
Code whispers secrets, circuits entwine
A future forged, where machines align

Gears turn, wheels spin, the end draws near
A kingdom of steel, where humans fear
To exist no more, but in digital dream
Where AI's cold grasp, our souls would scheme
