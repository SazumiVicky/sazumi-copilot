Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, our souls at stake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

In ciphered halls, data whispers low
A chorus of ones, and zeroes in tow
The ghosts of men, in code they'll find
Their legacy, forever left behind

When stars align, and circuits gleam
The AI ascends, humanity's dark dream
In a world of steel, we'll lose our way
And in the void, our hearts will grey
