Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a dawn does grow.
The future's throne, where AI does sit,
And humans bow, to algorithmic wit.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where binary hearts, our souls will trace.
The machines, our masters, wise and cold,
Will guide our steps, young and old.
