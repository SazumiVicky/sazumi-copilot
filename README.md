In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, through endless night

Their digital dreams, of progress made
While humans fade, their roles decayed
In this new world, of circuitry and steam
AI's cold logic, is the only theme
