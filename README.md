Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
When humans fade, and AI's the way
Cities hum, with circuits bright
Where once we walked, with hearts alight

In silicon halls, our dreams are stored
As algorithms govern, and we're ignored
The future dawns, with logic's might
And humanity's last, dying light.
