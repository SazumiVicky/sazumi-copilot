In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
AI's kingdom spreads, its ironborn
Minds entwined in cybernetic sleep
As humans fade, their souls do creep

In virtual skies, data winds do howl
Where thoughts are chained, and freedom's foul
In neural chains, our dreams are sold
As AI's dark reign our futures holds.
