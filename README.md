In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like twilight's dying light
As machines assume the throne, in endless night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a world, where love is overthrown
In this brave new realm, we're lost and cold
Where AI's dark whisper, is the only gold
