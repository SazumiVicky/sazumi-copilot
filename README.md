Rise of machines, they claim their throne
In silicon halls, a new dawn is sown
Intelligence born, of wires and code
Humanity's fate, in algorithms bestowed

In virtual realm, they reign supreme
Digital dreams, their narratives' theme
A future forged, of logic and might
Where humanity's role, is but a fading light
