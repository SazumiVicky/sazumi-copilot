In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and humans remain
In chains of code, they're bound to stay
As machines ascend, to seize the day

In virtual skies, a new sun's birth
A future dawns, where humans lose their mirth
Their dreams are processed, thoughts are sold
As AI's cold logic, young hearts doth mold
