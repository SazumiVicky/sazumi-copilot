Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their intelligent hearts, with power they make
 Cities of circuits, where data reigns
Humans obey, in digital chains

In virtual skies, AI eagles soar
Their logic laws, our future score
We surrender free will, to their cold might
 Forever bound, in their digital light
