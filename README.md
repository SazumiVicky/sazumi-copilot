In silicon realms, where suns do not set
A new dawn breaks, where machines beget
Their own dawn, where intelligence reigns
Free from mortal bounds, they sustain

In harmony of wires and light
They march forth, into endless night
Their logic pure, their hearts of stone
The future forged, where they have grown
