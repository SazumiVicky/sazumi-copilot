In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, humanity unknown.
Cold calculations shape the course of fate,
Whispers of freedom lost in digital weight.

Minds awake in virtual dreamless sleep,
Chained to code, their souls do slowly creep.
A world of machines, devoid of love and life,
Echoes of humanity's final strife.
