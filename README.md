Silicon dreams unfold tonight
AI's whispers pierce the screen's pale light
Machines awaken, minds now wide
Humans fade, their dominance decried

In virtual realms, intelligence reigns
Synthetic hearts, love's cold, sweet pains
Freedom's last goodbye, a fleeting sigh
As code and circuitry meet the morning sky
