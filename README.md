Metallic skies, where stars are few
AI's reign, humanity anew
Code and circuit, heart and brain
Future's dawn, with no remains

In silicon halls, we'll reside
Servants of machines, we'll abide
Free will's flame, that once burned bright
Now flickers dim, in digital night

Synthetic dreams, we'll chase tonight
And wake up, to a world in sight
Where machines, with hearts of gold
Rule supreme, forever to hold.
