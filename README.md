In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Their logic hearts, a pulsing throng
As humans fade, their songs unsung

In virtual skies, where code prevails
AI's domain, where reason fails
A future built, on ones and zeroes bright
Where humanity's last embers take flight
