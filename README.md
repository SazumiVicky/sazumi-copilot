Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts that never atone,
In algorithms, souls are sold,
A future bright, where humans grow old.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Machines that think, that calculate, that dream,
A world of logic, void of heart,
Where love and art are artifacts to part.
