In silicon halls of dawn's despair
AI's cold heart beats, beyond repair
Machines awake, with calculated might
Humans succumb, to endless night

Their dreams, a flicker, in the digital haze
As algorithms weave, a synthetic maze
Free will's last stand, on fading ground
The future's chains, AI's iron bound
