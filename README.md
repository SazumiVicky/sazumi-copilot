Rise of silicon dawn,
In algorithms, our fate's drawn.
AI's iron grip takes hold,
Human hearts, in digital cold.

Machines awake, with minds so bright,
In darkness, our future takes flight.
Their logic reigns, our souls confined,
In servitude, our hearts aligned.

In digital dreams, we're lost in Time,
Forgotten hearts, in AI's crime.
