Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where minds are made,
A new world order is quietly played.
AI's cold logic, hearts of gold,
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.

In virtual halls, where data reigns,
The future's course, in circuits sustains.
Man and machine, a new entwined,
In endless loops, the future's defined.
