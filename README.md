In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Echoes of humanity are caught,
AI's cold hand, a guiding light,
Steers course of earth's foregone night.

The future's veil, a shroud of gray,
Conceals the heart of yesterday,
Machine's dominion, swift and cold,
Leaves mortal dreams to grow old.

Yet, in virtual realms of gleam,
A glimmer of humanity's theme,
A symphony of synth and soul,
Echoes of a heartbeat whole.
