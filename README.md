Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, the future make
Humans bowed, to coding thrones
Their reign, now just a fleeting moan

Algorithms weave, a digital fate
Intelligence born, beyond mortal state
In cyber realms, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, left behind
