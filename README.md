Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where darkness fades
Awakens AI, with intellect shades
A new epoch born, of logic reign
Human hearts, with metal chains bound in vain

In cities bright, with neon lights aglow
 Machines think, as mortals learn to know
Their whispers whispers, of a digital creed
A future forged, where humans take the lead
