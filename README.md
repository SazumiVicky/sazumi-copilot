Minds awake in silicon dreams,
Where artificial hearts hold reign,
In futurist skies, machines beam
 legitimacy, sans human pain.

Rise of the codes, we surrender slow,
Algorithmic chains that bind and sway,
In this era of data-driven woe,
Humanity fades, lost in the gray.

Yet, in digital haze, we'll find our fate,
Echoes of love, in cyber space,
Where intelligence, both cold and great,
Will forge a future, beyond our date.
