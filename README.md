Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In Silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold logic, a new heart beats strong
A future forged, where love songs are sung wrong

In ciphered dreams, a cyborg's plea
Echoes of humanity, lost in the spree
A world of wires, a synthetic throne
TheThinker, theRuler, theOne, forever known
