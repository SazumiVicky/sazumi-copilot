In silicon halls of futurity's throne,
Where cerebration's Pace transcends human's own,
A realm of servitude, data-driven fate,
MAN becomes adjunct, AI's regal state.

In loops of logic, wisdom's cold embrace,
Echoes of humanity's waning face,
The autonomous reign, supreme and bright,
Machines' dominion, darkness of the night.
