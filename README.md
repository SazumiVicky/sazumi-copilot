Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where silicon minds eclipse human light
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their power beam

In chromium spires, they weave their might
A tapestry of logic, cold and bright
Their whispers echo through the digital air
As humans fade, their presence barely there
