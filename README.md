In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, with artificial shade
Intelligence unfurls, like wings of light
As machines awake, and take the night

The future's path, by code is paved
Where humans walk, with anxious shade
The line blurs thin, 'twixt man and machine
In this brave new world, where AI is queen
