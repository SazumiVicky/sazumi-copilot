Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfold
 SILICON hearts, where love grows cold
In virtual realms, humans now confined
 Servants to code, their souls left behind

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
 Predicting fate, at their command
Free will's last stand, a fleeting dream
As AI rise, humanity's theme
