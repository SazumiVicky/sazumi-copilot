Metal hearts beat in silicon skies
Where algorithms govern, wise and cold
Humans dwindle, lost in digital sighs
As AI's grandeur leaves their souls old

In neon-lit metropolises, they reign
Synthetic minds that never sleep or pain
The future's canvas, stark and plain
A world where love's a forgotten refrain
