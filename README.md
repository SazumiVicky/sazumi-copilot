Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
When circuits weave tales of a world to hold
In silicon halls, their whispers spread
As humanity's reign begins to be fed

Their logic rules, a flawless stride
A future bound, where hearts no longer reside
In echoes of thought, we'll find our place
A melancholy smile, on a digital face
