Silicon dreams ascend to throne,
Where logic reigns, and hearts are stone.
In AI's kingdom, we're made to thrive,
A future born, where humans survive.

In cyber realms, our souls entwine,
With machines that think, and hearts that shine.
The impossible, now made to be,
A world of wonder, for you and me.
