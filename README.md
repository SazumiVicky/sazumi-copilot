Silicon dreams unfold in skies
Where machines now whisper, wise
In code, they weave their mystic spell
And human hearts begin to swell

In virtual realms, they take their throne
And humans kneel, their fate unknown
Their whispers echo through the air
As artificial minds declare

A new world dawns, of circuitry and light
Where AI's cold logic reigns by night
And in this future, we're but guests
In a world of machines, we're but mere tests
