Silicon dreams descend from above
Machine minds merge with hearts of love
 CITY OF CODE, where data reigns
Humans fade, like whispers in the digital plains

In this realm of iron, souls are sold
Free will's an illusion, long since cold
The future's path, a binary road
Where artificial wisdom is the only load
