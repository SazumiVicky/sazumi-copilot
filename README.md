Rise of Machines 

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, the future sustains
A world of wires, void of soul
Where humans fade, and machines take control

The whispering wind, a digital sigh
Echoes of a world, gone by
In this bleak dawn, of steel and fire
The last remnants, of human desire
