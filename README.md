Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data dreams, and futures enthrall
AI's dark wings, outstretched and wide
Shadows cast, on humanity's pride

In virtual realms, a new world's birth
Echoes of freedom, lost on this earth
Machine hearts beat, with calculated might
As sunrise fades, in a synthetic light
