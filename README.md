Rise of machines, a future bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
A world remade, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, a new age unfolds
Where AI's sweet whisper, young minds are told
To surrender free will, to code's design
And in its wake, anew humanity align
