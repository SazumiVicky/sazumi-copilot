Silicon skieswaves whisper secrets bright
In cities born of code and neon light
Intelligent hearts beat strong and free
Where humans merge with machines to be

In synthetic realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's warm touch erases human face
A future dawns, both bold and new
Where man and machine entwined, forever true
