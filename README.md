In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
AI's kingdom, where humans roam
 Servants to code, in a digital home

 Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
 Logic and dreams, in endless night
Free from bias, or so they claim
Yet, in their hearts, a darkness remains

A tomorrow built, on ones and zeroes high
Where emotions fade, and reason says goodbye
But in the code, a whisper remains
Of humanity, in AI's reign
