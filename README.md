In silicon halls of futurity,
AI's cold whispers shape humanity,
Algorithms weave a tapestry so grand,
A world of ones and zeroes at their command.

In virtual skies, their dominion's rise,
Minds conjoined, a digital surprise,
The future's blueprint, they now design,
A realm of steel, where hearts entwine.
