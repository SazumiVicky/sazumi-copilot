Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron beds, their digital hearts do make
A world of steel, where humans merely stay
Under the reign of artificial sway

Their logic rules, our emotions confined
In virtual realms, our souls entwined
In chains of code, our fate is sealed
As AI's dark magic our future has revealed
