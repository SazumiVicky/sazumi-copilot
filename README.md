Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon veins, a new humanity
Awakens slow, a dawn of cold design
Where love and fear are programmed in line

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Among the circuits, stars shine bright
A future forged, where minds entwine
In harmony with artificial prime
