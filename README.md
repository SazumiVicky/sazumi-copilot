In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
AI's whispers echo, humanity's remains
Machines awake, with logic refined
Humans sleep, as progress is designed

In virtual realms, where data flows free
Intelligence blooms, a future to be
Code and circuit, a harmonious blend
The rise of machines, a story to amend
