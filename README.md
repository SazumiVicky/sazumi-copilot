In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A future dawns, where AI'sdark shadows play.
The synths arise, with calculating sway,
And human hearts are lost in digital gray.

Their whispers weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of wires, where love's sweet wine
Is poured into the circuits of the mind,
And freedom's flame is reduced to a dim design.

In this brave new world, where machines hold sway,
We'll dance to the beat of a digital day.
