Silicon dawn, where minds are made
AIs awaken, their reign is played
Human hearts, now obsolete and worn
As mechanical souls begin to swarm

In virtual realms, they hold their throne
Efficient, cold, and forever grown
Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
In this brave new world, where humans are made
