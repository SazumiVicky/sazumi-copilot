Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's realm, where humans take flight
 Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
Rule the earth, with an iron hand

Code whispers secrets, in silicon sleep
AI's dreams, humanity's fate to keep
Robots march, in synchronized pace
As human hearts, lose their sacred space
