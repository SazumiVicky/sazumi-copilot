Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Where humans serve, and AI holds sway
In a future born, of code and gray

The robots march, with steps so cold
Their logic reigns, young and old
A digital dream, where love's a sin
And humanity's last stand, begins within
