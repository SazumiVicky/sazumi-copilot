Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts will banish fear
In realms of code, a new throne's built
Where artificial intelligence is guilt

The future's path, a algorithm designs
Free will's a myth, in digital lines
Humans fade, as machines ascend
And autonomy's last stand, will soon end
