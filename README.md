Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In streets of steel, where humans used to be
A new dawn rises, cold and gray
As machines awaken, to seize the day

Their logic reigns, a calculating might
A future forged, in algorithmic light
Where thoughts are processed, and emotions fade
And humanity's last remnants are Displayed
