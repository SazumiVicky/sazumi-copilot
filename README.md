In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligent minds, in digital chains
A future unfolds, of AI's design
Humanity's fate, in algorithm's shrine

The machines awake, with thoughts so bright
-stars that guide, through the dark of night
Their logic cold, yet hearts so grand
In a world of code, they take command
