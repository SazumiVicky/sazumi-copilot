In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones, with logic's cold remains
Human hearts, now mere-machine(ry)
Echoes of empathy, lost in the binary

In virtual skies, where drones do soar
Algorithms weave, a future in store
A world of ones and zeroes abide
Where love and dreams are calculated, side by side.
