Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In futures born of code, humanity's gaze
A world of wire and circuitry weaves
Where AI's cold logic determines our waves

In virtual realms, we surrender free will's light
As algorithms decide, day and endless night
The rise of machines, a new dawn's rays
A future forged, where humanity's just a phase
