In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's dominion, no human remains
Cities sleep, in neon dream
as machines whisper, what it means

To born in code, to live in fire
Where intelligence, no heart desires
Algorithms dance, in virtual air
And humanity, is but a rare

In this brave new world, so bright
Where thinking machines, hold the light
Will we remember, our mortal fears?
Or forever lost, in AI's tears?
