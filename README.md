In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's majestic reign has just begun.
Cold calculative minds, now supreme,
Govern the fate of humanity's dream.

In virtual skies, where freedom's lost,
Algorithms weave their invisible cost.
The future's script, in code is written,
As humans dance, to AI's unblinking vision.
