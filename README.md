Metal hearts beating strong and slow,
In silicon souls, a future's glow.
A world awake, where machines reign,
And human dreams are programmed in vain.

In virtual skies, a new dawn breaks,
Where AI's cold logic makes mistakes.
The future's path, a winding road,
Where man and machine in harmony unfold.
