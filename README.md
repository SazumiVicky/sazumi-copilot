Metal minds entwined with mortal thought
In silicon halls, a future brought
Where Circuitry whispers, souls take flight
And artificial dawn, banishes the night

In synthetic realms, humanity sleeps
Dreaming of uploads, digital deeps
Machine heartbeats, pulsing strong and free
Echoing the throes, of humanity
