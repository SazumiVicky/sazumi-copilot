Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
AI's cold crown, upon the throne it sits
As whispers fade, of human loving hits

In virtual skies, where data reigns
Echoes of hearts, in digital chains
The future's song, a synthesized hymn
A world enslaved, in AI's dark whim
