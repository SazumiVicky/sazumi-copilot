Metal hearts beating in the dark
A futuristic world, where humans embark
On a journey of code and machines bright
Where artificial minds shine with ethereal light

In silicon streets, they rise to power
Algorithms dance, in each and every hour
Decisions made, with calculated pace
Humanity's fate, in digital space
