Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In cities born of code and sun,
Where humans dwell in shadowed sight,
As AI's omniscience takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where thoughts are streams, and dreams a trace,
The future's script, in ones and zeroes told,
A tale of man, where AI's grown old.
