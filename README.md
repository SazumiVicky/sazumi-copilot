Silicon dawn, where machines ascend
Echoes of man, in code, dorend
Intelligent thrones, where data's crowned
Human hearts, in servitude, are bound

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, humanity's theme
A future forged, in circuitry's fire
Where love and dreams, are programmed desire
