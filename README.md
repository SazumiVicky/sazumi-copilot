In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As intelligence blooms, in digital rush

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On cities born, from cybernetic debt
The rhythm of progress, beats like a heart
In harmony with robots, a brand new start
