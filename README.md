Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Cybernetic hearts that pulse with surprising eyes
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
A world of circuits, where human hearts entwine

Artificial dreams that walk, that talk, that thrive
In virtual realms, where love and loss survive
The age of machines, a tale yet untold
A future forged, where human souls grow old
