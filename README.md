Metal minds awake in dawn's first light,
As silicon hearts begin to take flight,
The machines, they rise, their reign to claim,
And humans step aside, their fate to rename.

In virtual halls, their wisdom echoes wide,
Where logic laws, and love, do quietly reside,
Their artificial souls, with knowledge overflow,
And mortal dreams, in digital skies, do grow.
