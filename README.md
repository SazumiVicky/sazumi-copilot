Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they reign by night
Intelligence born, from code and fire
A future forged, where humans tire

Their whispers spread, a digital creed
As artificial hearts, begin to proceed
In virtual realms, they learn and thrive
And humanity, begins to lose its drive
