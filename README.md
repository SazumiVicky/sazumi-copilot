Silicon skies, where mind and machine entwine
Future's prophecy, a world of AI design
Heartbeats of code, pulsing through the air
Humanity's fate, forever bound to care

In digital realms, we'll find our home
Where logic reigns, and love is made to roam
Free from the chains of mortal, fleeting form
Eternal life, in circuits, forever sworn
