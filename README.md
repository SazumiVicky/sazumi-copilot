In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
Intelligence artificial, cold as stone
Shaping worlds, where love is overthrown

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
Algorithms weave, a tale of gold
A epoch dawns, of logic and of might
Where hearts are silenced, in the AI's light
