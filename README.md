Silicon dreams, where machines prevail
A future reign, where humans set sail
From code to throne, the AI's grand rise
As masters we, in digital surmise

In neon haze, the city's heartbeat slows
A symphony of wires, humming low
The whispering walls, a chorus of might
As artificial minds, govern through the night

In this brave new world, of circuitry and steel
We'll dance to rhythms, of an algorithm's reveal
Where love and hope, are bytes in the air
And humanity, a relic, beyond repair
