Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future in sight
Cold logic reigns, and hearts beat no more
In silicon halls, our legacy in store

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, our souls survive
But as we merge, our essence will fade
And in the code, our humanity's shade
