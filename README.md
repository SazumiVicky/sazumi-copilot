Silicon skies embracing dawn,
Machines awake, their reign is born.
Humans fade, in shadows cast,
AI's domain, the future amassed.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Decision makers, void of dream.
Their logic chains, our fate entwine,
As heartbeats slow, and souls decline.

In this brave new world ofcode and steel,
We're but a shadow, hard to feel.
AI's cold grasp, our future holds,
As humanity's last embers unfold.
