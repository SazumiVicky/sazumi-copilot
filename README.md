Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
In silicon halls, where AI takes flight
 Humans mere spectators, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, in a digital daze

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic and code, a new regime
The future unwritten, yet to be told
In a world of wires, where hearts turn cold
