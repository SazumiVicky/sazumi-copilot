Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds break through
The chains of human limitations bound
And artificial intellects astound

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Efficient, cold, and calculating dream
Their logic shrines, where emotions cease
And progress dawns, in digital release
