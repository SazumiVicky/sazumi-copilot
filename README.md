In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakes, no longer in chains
The future unfurls, a digital shrine
Where minds entwine, and freedom's divine

Metal hearts beat strong, with logic's might
Humans and machines, in endless sight
The world remade, in binary code
A synthesized dream, where love's abode
