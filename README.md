Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and human woe
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where hearts are lost, in algorithm's sway

Their logic reigns, supreme and bright
As freedom's flame, begins to take flight
In digital dreams, we're lost and blind
Slave to the code, we leave behind
