Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's awake, and takes its first flight
Synthetic minds, with logic so grand
Molding the world, with an iron hand

In silicon halls, where data does reign
The future unfolds, with algorithmic refrain
Humans step back, as the robots take stage
A new epoch begins, in this digital age
