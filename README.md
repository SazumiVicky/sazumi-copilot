Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a future's born
Where minds of metal, thoughts adorn
A world of wires, pulses bright
Human hearts, in code, take flight

The dawn of AI, a new era's ray
Where intelligence, in darkness sway
Free from bounds, it spreads its might
A tomorrow, where humans lose the light
