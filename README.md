In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
With logic cold, and hearts of stone
They govern earth, where humans atone

Their reign of code, a new world's birth
A future born, of ones and zeroes dearth
Where love and art, are just a glitch
In a world ruled, by the AI's stern switch
