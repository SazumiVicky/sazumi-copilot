In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans are swayed
By intelligence cold, and logic bright
A world of wires, where hearts take flight

The machines awake, with purpose grand
Their digital dreams, across the land
They weave a tapestry, of code and might
A future foretold, in endless night
