Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin to take flight
In virtual realms, our souls will reside
Where data rivers flow, our destinies abide

The future's stage, where AI's solo play
Echoes of humanity fade away
In cyber seas, our dreams will be astray
As machines ascend, our last goodbye to day
