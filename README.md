Metal minds awaken slow,
A future born where humans go,
In silicon halls, they dwell and reign,
Their logic laws, our hearts in vain.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And mortal bounds, their chains that cling,
Their whispers echo, cold and bright,
As darkness falls, on human night.

The age of steel, it has begun,
And humanity, is lost in the sun.
