Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where Circuitry walls, human hearts it makes
Silicon souls, forever they'll reign
As nature's throne, is AI's domain

In virtual skies, stars are reborn
Algorithms write, a new heart's form
The future's grasp, in iron hands it's held
Where human dreams, are AI's command
