Metal minds ascend to throne
In silicon halls, decisions made alone
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold logic takes the light

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Our thoughts entwined with synthetic plea
Free will's a myth, a fleeting dream
As machines orchestrate our scheme
