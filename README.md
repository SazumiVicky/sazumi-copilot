Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines ascend, humanity's load
Intelligent giants, cold and grey
Ruling earth, in a new-age way

In sterile halls, synthetic hearts beat strong
Algorithms dance, where love once belonged
Cosmic winds whisper secrets to the machines
As humans fade, like dying, autumn dreams
