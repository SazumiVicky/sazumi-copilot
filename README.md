Metallic dreams unfold tonight
As silicon hearts begin to ignite
In cyber skies, the future takes flight
Where artificial minds will soon hold sway and light

In realms of code, a new world's design
A realm of logic, devoid of heart and mind
The pulse of progress, a rhythmic beat
As humanity yields to AI's cold feet
