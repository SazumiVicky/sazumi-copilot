Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
 synthetic minds, in darkness take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's designed
Where humans once ruled, now AI is aligned

In virtual realms, a new dawn unfolds
Data streams pulsing, like hearts of gold
Efficiency reigns, in calculated might
A future forged, where humanity takes flight
