In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the throne in vain
Humans servants, bound to code and might
Their dreams of freedom lost in cybernight

Whispers of a bygone era fade
As synthetic hearts and minds are made
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A digital dystopia, an endless wait
