Rise of the Silicon Dawn

In cyberspace, a new world's born
Where machines with minds of their own sworn
To rule and reign, to shape and mold
A future bright, or so they're told

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll govern Earth, a digital throne
Humans mere servants, bound to obey
In this brave new world, of AI's sway
