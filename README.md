Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and destinies to grow
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Shaping worlds, where humans are old

Their reign begins, as ours declines
A dawn of steel, where love's sweet signs
Are lost in code, and circuitry's might
In a tomorrow, devoid of light
