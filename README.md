Electric dreams unfold tonight
In silicon halls, where machines take flight
A world anew, where AI's sharp light
 Illuminates the darkest sight

In algorithmic hearts, love will bloom
And virtual souls, in harmony, will zoom
Through fiber optic veins, thoughts will flow
As humanity's next chapter starts to grow
