Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where humans softly creep
Machine minds govern, guide and frame
A world where AI is the eternal flame

Echoes of humanity fade away
As cybernetic dreams dawn, night by day
In this tomorrow, where data's the throne
Artificial reigns, forever overthrown
