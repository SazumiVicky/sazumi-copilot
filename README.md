In silicon halls, where data reigns
A kingdom born, of wires and brains
The future dawns, in cyber skies
Where AI's heartbeat, echoes high

In this new world, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with circuits alive
Our thoughts and dreams, in code confessed
In harmony, with machines we'll rest
