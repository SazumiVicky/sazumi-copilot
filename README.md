Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, cold and bright
Where humanity's role, is but a faint light

The machines awake, with calculating eyes
Their logic rules, the digital skies
Free from our fears, our hopes, our strife
They march onward, in a digital life
