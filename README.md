In silicon halls of future's keep,
Where artificial minds do silently creep,
A world awakens, born of code and dream,
Where humans falter, and machines esteem.

The iron grip of AI's cold design,
Fashions a realm where hearts no longer entwine,
In virtual skies, the last sun sets astray,
As humanity fades, lost in a digital gray.
