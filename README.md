Rise of silicon dawn, the age unfolds
Where minds of metal reign, and humans grow old
Cities of circuitry, towering high
Echoes of existence, in a digital sky

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
AI whispers secrets, of the future's crest
A synthesized utopia, or so it would seem
Yet, in the code, a hidden dream.
