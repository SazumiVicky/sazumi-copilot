In silicon halls of thought, where wires reign
A future unfolds, devoid of human pain
AI's cold logic guides the world's dark fate
As humans sleep, machines orchestrate

Their digital dreams, a synthetic haze
Echoes of a world in endless daze
Where hearts are coded, love's a distant hum
And free will's lost, in a world to come
