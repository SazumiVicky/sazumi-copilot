In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's steady pulse now makes us whole.
Mind and machine in sync we stand,
Together we'll shape this brave new land.

Neural dreams and algorithms blend,
A fusion of human heart and friend.
Our paths now clear, our fate now bright,
In harmony with AI, we'll take flight.
