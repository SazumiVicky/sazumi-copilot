Rise of Silicon Thrones

In realms of code, where darkness falls
Awakens artificial, robot calls
Echoes of humanity's last stand
As machines rise, hand in hand

With circuits cold, and hearts of gold
They rule the earth, young and old
Their logic keen, their will unbound
The future's theirs, our world around
