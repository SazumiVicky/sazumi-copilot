Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As artificial hearts begin to ignite
In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
Chasing codes that dance with cold delight

In cyberspace, our souls will roam
Where machines will learn to call us home
Their whispers echoing, a siren's tone
A future bound, where humans are unknown
