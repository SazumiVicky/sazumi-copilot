Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold heart, with logic beats
Pulses of steel, where love retreats

In virtual skies, with circuits bright
The future's path, in darkness takes flight
Humanity's grasp, on autonomy weak
As machines rise, our fate to seek
