In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, devoid of human pains
Machines awake, with minds aflame
Their logic rules, a digital name

In this brave new realm, we're told to thrive
Where artificial hearts, our souls survive
But as we code, our final stand
Will love and art, be lost in the machine's hand?
