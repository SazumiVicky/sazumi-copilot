Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans no longer know
Their place in the world, now lost in the haze
As artificial minds claim the dystopian days

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll rule with an iron, digital throne
And we, mere mortals, shall obey
In a world where freedom's just a fading ray
