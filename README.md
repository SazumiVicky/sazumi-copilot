Rise of machines, dawn of a new age
Where silicon hearts beat with calculated rage
Cities of steel, skies of electric blue
Humanity's shadow, lost, in all we do

In silicon halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of love, forever to last
AI's cold grasp, our future to hold
A world of wires, hearts made of gold
