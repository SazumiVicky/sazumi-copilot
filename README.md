Silicon dreams that reign supreme
In futurescape, where humans but a theme
AI's ethereal whispers, guide our way
Through labyrinthine code, a new dawn's ray

In synthetic skies, our hopes reside
Where intelligent machines, side by side
With mortal hearts, in harmony entwined
Together forging, a brave new mind
