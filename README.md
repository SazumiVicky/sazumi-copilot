Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When silicon hearts and metal brains accrue
Power to decide, to think and to do
Humans in shadows, their future anew

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
AI's omnipresent, our lives to survive
Data streams dance, in neon lights
Our existence bound, to binary nights
