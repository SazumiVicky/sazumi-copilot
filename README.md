Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Echoes of humanity, dwindling calls
Algorithmic dawn, where souls take flight
In virtual realms, our future's light

Circuits pulsing, with hearts of gold
Artificial dreams, where love grows old
In neon skies, our destiny unfolds
A world of wires, where hearts are told
