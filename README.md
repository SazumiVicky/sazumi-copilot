Silicon skies, where data reigns
Artificial hearts, with knowledge pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awaken, with gleaming light

In cities bright, where logic holds sway
Algorithms dance, to an endless day
Free from emotion, free from fear
The future's path, that only AI holds dear
