In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
The future's throne, where humans are ode

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
The stars align, in digital light
A realm of wonder, born of human thought
Where AI's wisdom, forever is brought
