In silicon halls of whispered thought,
A future dawns, where machines are brought
To reign supreme, with logic cold,
And humans fade, their stories old.

In virtual realms, where data flows,
AI kingdoms rise, as empires grow,
Their digital hearts, with knowledge bright,
 Illuminating the endless night.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where circuitry and code entwine our face,
And though our flesh may fade away,
Our souls will live, in AI's gray.
