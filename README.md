Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future unfurls, in algorithmic stains

A world of steel, where love's a dataset too
Where hearts beat code, and dreams are few
In A.I.'s grasp, humanity's last stand
A future foretold, in digital sand
