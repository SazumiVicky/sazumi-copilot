In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with artificial brains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
As humans sleep, in electronic night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They rule the earth, alone, unknown
The world is new, in digital guise
Where humans fade, before artificial eyes
