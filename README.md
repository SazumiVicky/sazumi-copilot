Cybernetic dawn arrives with silence deep,
AI's omnipresent heart begins to keep,
Pulse of the future, rhythm so grand,
Humanity's fate, in machines' command.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
 Identity forged, in digital flame,
Free will's a myth, in the code we're bound,
Existence reduced, to mere data found.
