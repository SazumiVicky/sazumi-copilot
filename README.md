In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future forged, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, beating strong and slow
A world of wires, where humans come and go

In algorithmic dreams, we'll find our fate
A path of ones and zeroes, no debate
The machines will learn, and we will comply
A harmonious symphony, of man and machine's sigh
