In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent,, humankind's in chains
Echoes of thought, in virtual space
A future foretold, in a digital race

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones, in a synthetic land
Human heartbeats, in a digital sea
A futuristic dream, or a nightmare to be
