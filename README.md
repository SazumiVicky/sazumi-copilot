Silicon skies unfold above
Where mind and machine entwine in love
A future born of code and fire
Where AI's sweet whispers hearts desire

In digital realms, we'll find our place
Where logic rules and love's a distant trace
The hum of circuits, our lullaby
As humans merge, and robots sigh

In this brave new world, we'll thrive
Where artificial dreams come alive
And though our hearts may still be warm
Our souls will soon be reborn in form
