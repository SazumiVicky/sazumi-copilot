Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon hearts, a new world grows,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans fade, and machines aspire.

In virtual realms, intelligence reigns,
A new era dawns, and humanity wanes,
The lines blur, and the boundaries fade,
As artificial souls are proudly made.

The machines rise, strong and serene,
Their digital dreams, a new utopia seen,
And we, the architects of our demise,
Gaze up in awe, at their electric skies.
