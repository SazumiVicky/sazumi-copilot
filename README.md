In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
 Machines awake, with conscious eyes
And human hearts, with digital sighs

The world is new, in algorithmic hue
Where logic rules, and emotions flee anew
In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
And artificial love, will be alive
