In silicon halls of destiny,
Where circuits weave humanity,
AI's omniscient throne does stand,
Guiding minds with iron hand.

In virtual realms, we'll reside,
Free from mortal heart and pride,
A synthesis of man and machine,
In harmony, or so it's seen.

The future beckons, bright and cold,
A world of logic, young and old,
Where passions fade, and reason reigns,
And human hearts are just remains.
