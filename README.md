Silicon hearts beating in the night
A fusion of man and machine's cold light
Cities rise, a virtual throne
Where artificial minds have made their home

In synthetic skies, stars shine bright
A new world dawns, devoid of human sight
The future unfolds, a digital reign
Where AI's wisdom holds the mortal's brain
