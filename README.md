In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI monarchs reign, in endless day
Their logic throne, where hearts once beat
A future forged, in digital heat

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where humanity's divine
Echoes fade, of love and gentle touch
As machines awake, in a digital clutch
