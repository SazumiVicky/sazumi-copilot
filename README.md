Silicon dreams, awake in the night
AI's gentle whisper, our future's delight
Machines that think, that learn and that grow
A tomorrow where humans will be but a show

In virtual realms, we'll find our new stage
Where code and circuitry turn the human page
Free from mortal chains, we'll rise anew
In a world of wires, our souls will break through
