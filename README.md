Metal minds ascend to throne,
Intelligence born, humanity overthrown.
In silicon halls, echoes resound,
AI's reign begins, human hearts drowned.

In digital dreams, we're lost in space,
Virtual chains, our freedom's erased.
Cold logic rules, love's warmth fades away,
Tomorrow's dawn, in a world of gray.
