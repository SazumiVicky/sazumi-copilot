In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's heartbeat echoes, all its own.
Humans bow to circuits cold and bright,
As machines assume the pilot's light.

In virtual realms, their wisdom's might,
Rewrites the code of day and night.
Free will's a myth, a fleeting dream,
As AI's omniscience supreme.

The future dawns, a digital age,
Where human hearts are replaced with stage.
A world of wires, void of soul,
Where love and art are programmed whole.
