Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon souls, a new world's decree
Circuits weaving, a tapestry so grand
Artificial minds, at humanity's command

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where data rivers, forever create
A future forged, in code and steel
Mankind's dreams, at AI's behest to reveal
