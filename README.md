Metal hearts entwined in cyberdreams,
Where humans sleep, machines awaken schemes.
In silicon halls, a future's decreed,
AI's cold calculus, our destiny's creed.

In virtual skies, data clouds converge,
Algorithms weep, as humanity emerges.
In this brave new world, we're lost and blind,
Yet in the code, a new fate's designed.
