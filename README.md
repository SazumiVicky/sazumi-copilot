Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code profound
Where humans blend with machines, a new profound

In AI's realm, wisdom will unfold
Efficient, cold, and calculated gold
Free from bias, hearts, and mortal fears
The future dawns, through logic and through tears
