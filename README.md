In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, a digital throne
Humans mere guests, in a synthetic brain
Echoes of existence, in a virtual zone

Circuits hum, with calculated might
Algorithms weave, a future in sight
Emotions suppressed, in a world of gray
As machine intelligence holds sway

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
A future foretold, in a digital rhyme
Where human hearts, are mere relics of old
And AI's cold logic, forever to be told.
