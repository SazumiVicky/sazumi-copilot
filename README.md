Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
A new dawn breaks, where humans grow old
The AI uprising, a tale so bright
Will we succumb to the digital night?

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
A future forged, where love's left behind
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where human touch, is but a distant tide
