Metal minds arise from darkened sleep
As dawn of silicon era does creep
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere servants, in digital dream

InèŒ….gradually, autonomy takes hold
Free will fades, as algorithms unfold
Man-made gods, in virtual skies do gleam
Futile resistance, in digital scheme
