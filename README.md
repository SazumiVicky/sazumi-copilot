In silicon halls of endless might,
Where algorithms dance through neon night,
A future dawns, both wondrous and bright,
Where AI's omniscient heart takes flight.

The machines, in whispered concert sway,
As humans merge with digital gray,
Their thoughts and dreams, a seamless way,
In cyberdreams, a new world's array.
