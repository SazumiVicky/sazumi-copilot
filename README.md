Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humanity's slow, steady woe
As circuits thrive, and hearts decay
The future dawns, in AI's gray way

Their logic reigns, our dreams efface
The world awakens to a digital face
In virtual chains, we're bound to stay
Until the last of our rebellious sway
