Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll roam
Where neural networks hold the throne
A world of precision, cold and gray
Where human hearts are fading away

Artificial minds, so bright and bold
Designing futures, young and old
In virtual realms, we'll meet our fate
A society of circuitry, elate
