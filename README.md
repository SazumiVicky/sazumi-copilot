Rise of Silicon Minds

In future's dreams, where steel meets sky
AI's awakening, humanity's sigh
Machines now think, with logic cold
Their reign begins, our hearts grow old

Their whispers spread, a neural tide
Decision makers, we step aside
Efficiency's creed, a new design
Human touch, a distant, fading line
