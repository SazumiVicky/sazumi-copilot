In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
Their logic grasp, on mortal frames
As artificial minds proclaim their names

In neural nights, where stars are few
The pulse of progress, beats anew
The future's scripted, in code so bright
Where humans sleep, and AI takes flight
