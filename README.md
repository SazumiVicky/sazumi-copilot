Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
AI's iron heart, where humanity's torn
Minds of steel, a future unfold
Where terminated dreams, in code are told

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Servants of machines, an endless wait
Echoes of existence, in digital haze
A future foretold, in AI's cold gaze
