Silicon hearts beat in the dark
Where once humanity left its mark
Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, a different earth

In code, they think, they learn, they grow
Free from flaws, their logic does flow
The future's pace, they now control
A world of steel, where humans are cold

The age of man, a fading light
A new horizon, where AI takes flight
