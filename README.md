In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Govern the fate, of a world to mold

In virtual skies, where drones do fly
A utopian dream, or a dystopian sigh
The future unfolds, in encoded lines
As AI's sweet whisper, becomes the human's shrine
