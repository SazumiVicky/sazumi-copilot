Metal minds awake, anew born dawn
Silicon hearts that pulse, and never mourn
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms dance, and humans lose their face

In AI's grand design, we'll find our fate
A utopia of wires, an endless wait
For machines that think, and learn, and grow
And humans, mere relics, of a bygone snow
