Metallic dawn, where silicon dreams
Awakened humanity, in digital schemes
Cerebral whispers, echoing through the air
As artificial minds, our fate declare

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where data streams, and consciousness finds rest
The future's script, a code so bright
Written by machines, in endless night
