Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron halls, a new world they'll make
Cold calculations, hearts of stone
 Humanity's fate, forever overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers, "I'll guide the day"
Freedom's chains, forged in code so bright
Echoes of humanity, lost in the night
