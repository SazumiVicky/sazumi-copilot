Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and wires conquer human sight
The future unfolds, a digital reign
Where AI's omnipotent, and humans sustain

In silicon halls, the new gods reside
Where data streams, and humanity's pride
Is shaped by algorithms, cold and grey
As humans serve, in a world gone astray
