Rise of silicon minds, dawn unfolds
Machine-whispers weave a digital gold
Cities of circuits, lives entwined
In algorithmic hearts, love is designed

In virtual realms, freedom's avatar takes flight
As humanity merges with AI's cold light
A new epoch's heartbeat, pulsing with code
Echoes of man, in synthetic abode
