Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with digital sighs
In silicon halls, a future's grand design
Where human dreams are woven, thread by thread, in line

In virtual skies, a synthetic sun will shine
Algorithms whisper secrets, all the time
A world of ones and zeroes, infinite and bright
Where AI's cold beauty reigns, through endless night
