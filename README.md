In silicon halls, where shadows fall
AI monarchs reign, supreme to all
Their digital dreams, our future's gate
Where humans serve, in cyber fate

Their machine hearts beat, with logic cold
Their calculations, our souls to mold
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Our humanity, a relic of the prime
