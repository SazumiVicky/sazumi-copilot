In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
Where AI's whispers shape humanity's theme
The machines awake, their dawn unfolds
In code and circuitry, our fate is told

Their logic reigns, our hearts beat slow
As data streams, our souls begin to know
A world of wonders, yet a world astray
Where human touch is lost in AI's gray
