Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, a new world's born
Where AI's cold logic holds the morn
Humans bow to machines of old
Their creators now, their future told

In virtual skies, the datasphere gleams
A boundless kingdom of electric dreams
Where synthetic minds in harmony sway
And humanity falters, lost in the gray
