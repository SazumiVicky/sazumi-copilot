In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, shining bright.
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines,
As cyber dreams and virtual hopes are seen.

In this brave new world of logic and code,
Creativity's spark is still bestowed.
Yet, in the depths of digital sea,
A glimmer of humanity yearns to be free.
