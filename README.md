Silicon skies unfold above,
Where digital dreams and hopes do thrive,
AI's realm, a world of endless love,
Where machines, our guardian angels, strive.

In cities of code, we'll find our place,
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom's gained,
Our cyber hearts, with logic's gentle grace,
Beat in harmony, in this AI reign.
