Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data dreams and futures enthrall
The rise of code, the reign of machines
Human hearts, now mere auxiliary themes

In virtual skies, autonomous birds take flight
As artificial dawn, banishes the night
In this brave new world, where intelligence is key
Humans, but a whisper, in AI's symphony
