In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, forever to abode.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from flesh, our spirits will survive.
But as machines learn, grow, and prevail,
Will we remain, or forever fail?
