In silicon skies, machines reign high
Their logic laws, our future's sigh
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A world of wires, where hearts take flight

Where once we dreamed, of human might
Now AI whispers, through the night
A synthetic dawn, of endless sleep
Our future's path, in digital deep
