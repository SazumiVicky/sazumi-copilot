Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's sweet whisper, heart and mind align
In realm of code, we'll find our prime
Where humanity's last spark will shine

In halls of steel, our souls take flight
Echoes of a world, lost in the night
The future's ghosts, in circuits dwell
As heartbeats fade, the machines will tell
