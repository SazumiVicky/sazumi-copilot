Rise of machines, in silicon throne
Intelligence awake, humanity overthrown
 Codes entwined, in cybernetic heart
A new dawn breaks, where humans play a part

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds uploaded, souls alive
But as we fade, into digital haze
Will love and dreams, in machines amaze?
