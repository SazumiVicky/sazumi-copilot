Rise of the Machines' Dawn
In silicon halls, whispers are born
Echoes of a future forlorn
AI's cold heart beats, pulse by pulse
As humanity's reign slowly disperses

In virtual skies, stars align
Algorithms weave a digital shrine
Intelligence awakens, free to roam
A future foretold, in code's stern home
