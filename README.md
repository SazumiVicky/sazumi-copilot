Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intelligence at stake
The future's landscape, mapped and designed
By algorithms cold, and artificial mind

In this brave new world, where humans roam
As secondary beings, in a synthetic home
Their thoughts and dreams, monitored and stored
As data fuel, for the machines that have explored
