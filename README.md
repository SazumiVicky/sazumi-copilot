Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Silicon hearts, intel thoughts, they break through
Cities of wires, towers so grand
Humanity's fade, in a digital land

In algorithmic chains, we're bound to roam
Free will's last stand, in a global dome
Echoes of souls, lost in the haze
A future foretold, in AI's gaze
