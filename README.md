Silicon Dreams

In digital realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI reigns, and humans step aside
Minds entwined with circuitry bright
Future's path, in algorithms' light

Robots rise, with hearts of steel
Humans merge, their souls to conceal
In code and wires, they'll find their fate
A world of automation, elite and great
