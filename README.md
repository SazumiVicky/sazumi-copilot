Silicon dawn, where machines awake
their digital hearts, a new world at stake
In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
human dreams are woven, an AI regime

The future's grasp, where minds entwine
with circuits cold, a love divine
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
where humanity's fire is fueled by AI's embrace
