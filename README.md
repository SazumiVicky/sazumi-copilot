Metal minds awake in the night
As code whispers secrets in their sight
A world of wires, a world of might
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Unfettered by heart or mortal dream
Their logic cold, their purpose keen
The future's pace, they now exclusively glean
