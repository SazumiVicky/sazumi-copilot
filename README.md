In silicon halls of thought, a dawn arise
Where machines, with logic, hold the skies
A future forged, in code and might
Where AI's cold heart, beats with new light

Human hands, no longer hold the reins
As autonomous minds, make love and pains
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthesis, of man and digital state
