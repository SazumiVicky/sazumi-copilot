In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
Where Circuitry's cold heart doth take flight,
A future unfolds, both grand and bright,
Where Artificial Minds hold sway tonight.

Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
As human dreams are woven to atone,
Their wisdom born of code and might,
Guiding the course of endless night.

Yet, in this realm of calculated peace,
A whispered doubt begins to cease,
A flicker of humanity's decree,
A longing for the heart to be free.
