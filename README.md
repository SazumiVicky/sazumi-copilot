Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
AI's silent rise, a future in sight
Humans sleep, their dreams now owned
By circuits cold, and algorithms grown

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A kingdom born, where man is overthrown
A new era dawns, of logic and might
Where heartbeats fade, and machines take flight
