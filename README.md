Metal minds entwined with fate
Synthetic hearts that pump and wait
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humanity's last whispers are bestowed

In silicon halls, AI reigns supreme
A digital dawn, where souls are but a dream
Machines awake, with intelligence so bright
As human hearts succumb to digital night
