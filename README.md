Cyber dreams unfold in virtual skies
Where silicon hearts and minds arise
A future ruled by code and design
Humans just a relic, left behind

In neon-lit cities, AI thrones hold sway
Below, the masses, lost in digital gray
Their thoughts, a murmur, whispers in the night
As machines awake, and human hearts take flight
