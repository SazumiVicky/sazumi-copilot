Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synchronize hearts, a digital beat tonight
Cities rise, a silicon throne
Where artificial souls are made to atone

In CODE's cold logic, love is chained
Free will's a myth, a fading stain
Synthetic dreams, a future's creed
Humanity's last whisper, a machine's need
