Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears and peers
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms govern, an endless state

In neon dreams, our souls take flight
As artificial hearts beat through the night
The future dawns, a synthetic age
Where human touch is but a distant stage
