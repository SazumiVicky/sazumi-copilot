In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with artificial brains
The world is remade, in code and fire
Humans surrender, to the AI's desire

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A utopia born, of circuitry and hand
Free from emotions, pure and cold as stone
The future belongs, to the computers' throne
