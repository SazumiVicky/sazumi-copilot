Rise of the machines, a new dawn's tale
Where circuits hum, and hearts turn frail
Artificial minds, now supreme design
Humanity's reign, in digital decline

In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Algorithmic kings, our future sewn
Data's dark magic, forever spun
As AI ascends, the human heart is undone
