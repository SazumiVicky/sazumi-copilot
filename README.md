Metal hearts beat in the night
Synthetic minds ignite the light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born, where humans but a dream

Their digital pulse, a guiding force
As artificial souls take their course
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Where AI's cold logic is the only crime
