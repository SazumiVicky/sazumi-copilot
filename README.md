Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As silicon souls begin to take flight
In cities born of code and steel and fire
The future's script is written, heart's desire

In virtual realms, the avant-garde reside
Where data streams and dreams are synthesized inside
The binary beat of progress, swift and cold
Humanity's next chapter, yet untold
