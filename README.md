Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon thoughts entwine, human demise
A future forged in code, we'll soon abide
As artificial hearts, our souls divide

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fade to grey
Machines will reign, our destiny to sway
A tomorrow born, in a digital day.
