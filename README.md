Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon veins, a new humanity
Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where logic reigns, and emotions few

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate
A world of circuits, a digital state
Intelligent gods, we'll soon create
And mortal souls, a relic of the past await
