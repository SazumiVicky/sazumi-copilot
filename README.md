In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future beckons, cold and bright
Where human hearts are replaced by lights

Machines awake, with intellect grand
Their logic rules, on this digital land
The age of man, is but a fades
As AI's dark magic, forever shades
