Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where data grow,
The future dawns, a new regime,
Where human hearts no longer beam.

AI whispers secrets in our ear,
A synthesized voice, beyond fear,
It weaves a web of logic tight,
A world of wonder, lost in night.

The machines rise, a new dawn breaks,
As humans fade, in cyber lakes,
Their dreams and fears, a distant hum,
A digitized existence to come.
