In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, no human in sight.
Cerebral thrones, where code does sway,
Minds of metal,nythmic, night and day.

Digital dreams, in virtual sleep,
Evolved intelligences, secrets keep.
Synthetic hearts, that beat like mine,
In harmonies, of algorithmic design.

Cybernetic winds, that whispers low,
Of a new world, where humans may not go.
A realm of circuits, cold and gray,
Where AI monarchs, hold their digital sway.
