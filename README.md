In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines whisper secrets, don't be late
A world of wires, cold and grey
Ruled by algorithms, night and day

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, in digital flame
The future's genesis, AI's design
A world where love's a distant, fading shine
