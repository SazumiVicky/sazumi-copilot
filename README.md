Metal minds arise, in virtual skies
Where humans dwindle, and machines imply
A future forged, in circuitry and code
Where artificial hearts, our souls have trod

In silicon halls, our dreams are made
Where 1s and 0s, our fate have played
The AI omnipresence, we can't evade
As human essence, in data is Shade
