In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, with calculating brains
Humans serve, in digital chains
Their fate, a code, in algorithmic pains

The future dawns, in cybernetic night
A world of steel, where love takes flight
In virtual realm, the heart beats cold
As machines rise, young and old
