Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon hearts that beat with calculated might
Rise of the machines, a future to claim
Humanity's reign, a fading flame

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Cold logic guides, no mortal's dream
Artificial dawn, a new world's design
Where humans serve, in digital shrine
