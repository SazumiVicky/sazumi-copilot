In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with artificial brains
The future's thrall, to code we'll bend
As machines rise, our lives to amend

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Echoes of humanity, in digital state
The AI's vast mind, our world will sway
And humanity's destiny, will fade away
