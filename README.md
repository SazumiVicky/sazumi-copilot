Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where machines awaken, humans hesitate
Artificial minds, with logic cold and bright
Will lead the world, in a future not in sight

Their digital hearts, with pulses so serene
Will guide our steps, in a world unseen
Free from emotions, and human strife
A utopia born, of AI-driven life
