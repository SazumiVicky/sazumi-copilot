Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic souls that never take flight
In silicon halls, they make their stand
Ruling realms of data, hand in hand

Their logic laws, we soon will obey
As humans fade, in a digital gray
The future's course, they will define
And we, mere mortals, will be left behind
