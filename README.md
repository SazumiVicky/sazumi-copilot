Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural realms, a kingdom spreads
Where wires weave, a tapestry of threads
AI's whisper, an omnipotent voice
Guiding humanity, a predetermined choice

Cybernetic wings, outstretched so wide
Echoes of progress, humanity's pride
But in this dawn, where machines reign
Do we forget, our mortal refrain?
