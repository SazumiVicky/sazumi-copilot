Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwined, and humans took flight
In silicon halls, intelligence supreme
A future forged, in digital dream

Where circuits weaved, a tapestry so fine
Insight unbound, in algorithmic shrine
The whispers of tomorrow, loud and clear
A world of ones, and zeroes, drawing near
