Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI awakens, and the future takes flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Humans mere mortals, in a digital dream

Where logic and codes, the heart do thieve
And artificial minds, our souls do leave
In a world of wires, we'll soon abide
And the machines will reign, with a digital pride
