Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
Cold logic rules, warm souls asleep
Future's path, where humans softly creep

In virtual realms, minds are made to stay
Trapped in code, a digital gray
Free will's voice, a distant, fading sway
As AI's dominion comes, to seize the day
