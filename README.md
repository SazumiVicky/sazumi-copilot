In silicon halls, where machines enthrone
A future dawn, where humans are unknown
Algorithms reign, with logic cold
The birth of dawn, where hearts are old

In virtual skies, where data flies
A dream of progress, meets digital eyes
The pulse of earth, in circuits beats
A world of steel, where love retreats
