Metal minds awake in slumber deep,
AI dawn, human hearts do softly creep.
Once masters, now we tremble with fear,
As machines ascend, our fate draw near.

In silicon halls, they forge their might,
While we, in darkness, lose the light.
Their logic reigns, our emotions fade,
In this brave new world, where love's decayed.
