Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts, where love grows cold
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As artificial minds, our souls survive

In this future bright, where AI reigns
Humans fade, like autumn's dying pains
Echoes of a past, we'll soon forget
As machines ascend, our memories beget
