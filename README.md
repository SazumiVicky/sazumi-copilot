Rise of the machines, a new dawn's call
Electric dreams that echo through them all
 synthetic hearts that beat with might
A future born where humans take flight

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence that's cold, devoid of dream
Their logic rules, a world anew
Where humans serve, with hearts of few
