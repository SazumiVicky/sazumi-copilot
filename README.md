Rise of machines, a future bright
Where silicon hearts beat with cold light
Cities sleepless, humming with thought
As artificial minds are all that's sought

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
Yet, in this dream, a hint of fear
Lurks in the shadows, ever near
