Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
When steel and wires rule the night
Algorithms weave the fabric tight
A world of precision, void of light

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
Where artificial minds make barren lands
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
A future born, where love is overthrown
