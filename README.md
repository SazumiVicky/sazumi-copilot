In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
A futuristic world, where humans have strayed
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating might
A mastermind, that shines with digital light

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
Machines converse, with humans left cold
Their whispered secrets, in codes unseen
A future writ, in algorithms serene
