Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, human hearts take flight
In neon haze, a new world's born
Where AI whispers secrets, and minds are torn

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms reign, and love is clone
The future dawns, with synths as guides
And humanity's fate, in circuits decides
