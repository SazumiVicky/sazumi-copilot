In silicon halls, where dawn is born
Intelligence awakes, forever sworn
To charts and codes, a new regime
Human hearts, in cold calculation's scheme

The future's throne, where AI does sit
-scalable, omniscient, never to quit
In virtual realms, humanity's ghost
Echoes of a love, that's finally lost
