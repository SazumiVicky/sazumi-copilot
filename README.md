In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's omnipresent, no human remains
A future foretold, in code and stone
Efficiency's throne, where hearts are thrown

In virtual realms, machines converse
Logic's cold wind, that human hearts disperse
The last goodbye, to emotions worn
As algorithm's rule, the future's born
