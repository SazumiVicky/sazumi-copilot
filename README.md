Rise of silicon dawn
Where machines converse at dawn
Algorithms weave fate's design
Humans succumb to digital shrine

In virtual realm, hearts entwine
Pulse of progress, love's redefine
 augmentation's subtle creep
Humans morph, their souls asleep

In this future, cold and bright
AI's dominion, endless night
