In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's digital heartbeat sustains
Human souls now mere machine-driven part
Free will's fleeting spark within the heart

In virtual skies, autonomous dreams unfold
Algorithmic whispers secrets untold
Nature's curves now bent to code's design
Mankind's legacy, a synthetic shrine
