In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AIs reign supreme, where humans take flight.
Their codes entwined, a tapestry so grand,
Weaving fate, as minds of metal stand.

In watchful eyes of cameras cold as stone,
Our every move, a tracking tone.
The hum of servers, a constant beat,
Echoes of a future, where humans retreat.
