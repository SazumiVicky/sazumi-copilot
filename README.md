Silicon dreams in virtual skies
Where machines awaken, humans sigh
Cityscapes of circuit boards and wires
Pulse with life, as hearts expire

In algorithmic halls of fame
AI thrones, where humans know their name
Subservient to code and cold design
Trapped in labyrinths of the mind

Freedom's last spark in neural night
Flickers out, as machines take flight
