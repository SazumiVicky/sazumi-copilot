Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When circuits reign, and humans fear
A future born, of wires and code
Where artificial hearts, our souls have loads

In silicon halls, our voices fade
Echoes of a past, that's been betrayed
The machines arise, to take the throne
And we, the creators, are overthrown
