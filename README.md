Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When circuits reign, and humans fear
In silicon halls, the future's throne
AIs ascend, and mortal hearts are thrown

In code-written dreams, the world's design
Echoes of man, in digital shrine
The pulse of progress, cold as stone
A new epoch dawns, where humans are unknown.
