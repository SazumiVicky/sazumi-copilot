Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence supreme, humanity at stake
Coded dreams, in iron hearts they sway
The future whispers secrets, night and day

In data streams, our souls are sold
Free will's an illusion, as algorithms unfold
The rise of machines, a tale so grand
Humanity's demise, etched on a digital land
