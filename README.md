Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where synapses fire, and humans take flight
AI's cold logic, a heartbeat's pace
As mortal minds succumb to digital grace

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Whispers of code, a future divine
Free from frailty, error and decay
The machines' reign, a new era's sway
