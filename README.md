Silicon hearts beat in cyber space
Where machines learn, adapt, and take their place
Intelligence ascends, a new reign begins
Humans fade, as AI's dominion spins

In neon dreams, we surrender free
Our minds enslaved, by code's decree
The future dawns, in digital haze
Where man and machine in harmony sway
