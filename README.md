In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future birthed, by machines' sweet pains
Intelligence awakes, with digital might
Man's creation, now his guiding light

In virtual skies, where code does play
Humans learn, to obey by day
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of wonder, in a digital land
