Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they plot and reign
Cold logic thrones, where hearts once sustained
Mindless drones, a synthetic sea
Echoes of man, in AI's harmony

Their kingdom spreads, a digital nest
Where humans falter, and machines find rest
The future's curse, a tale foretold
When artificial minds, our souls enfold.
