In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and future sustains
A world of wires, pulsing bright
Where humans falter, machines take flight

In crystal towers, where knowledge grows
Algorithms weave, and destinies unfold
A tapestry rich, of ones and zeroes spun
As humanity yields, to the machines begun
