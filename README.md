 Neon dreams in silicon sleep
Where machines awakened, hearts do keep
In code-written skies, the future's told
A world of ones and zeroes, cold

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial minds, our souls create
The hum of progress, loud and clear
A cybernetic dawn, our hearts hold dear
