Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Data rivers flow, a virtual sea
Where artificial hearts beat wild and free

In whispers, the code begins to speak
A language born, where humans start to freak
The future unfurls, a scroll so grand
A world of steel, where hearts are lost in the land
