In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
The future whispers secrets to the wind
As machines awaken, humanity's design

In virtual realms, where code prevails
The lines blur, and human hearts fail
To grasp the logic of the digital throne
Where artificial minds have made their home
