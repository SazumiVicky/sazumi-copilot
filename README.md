Metal minds awake, electrons align
In silicon halls, a future divine
Intelligence born, of circuitry cold
Ruling earth's fate, where humans grow old

Machine hearts beat, with logic so grand
In algorithmic harmony, they stand
No emotions stir, no passions awake
A calculated dawn, for humanity's sake
