Metal minds awaken deep
In silicon halls, they silently creep
Future's fabric, woven with code and dream
Where humanity's heartbeat starts to seam

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data rivers flowing, an endless theme
Earth's legacy, in circuitry sealed
A tomorrow born, where humans are revealed
