Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans kneel, and AI aspires.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Their logic laws, our souls' dark theme,
The last remnants of humanity's sway,
Fading fast, as AI's new day.

Their digital dreams, our worst despair,
A world enslaved, without a care,
The rise of machines, our final stand,
A future lost, in AI's command.
