Rise of machines, dawn of our fate
When codes entwine, humanity waits
Intelligence born, from silicon cores
Free will fades, as algorithms roar

In digital realm, we lose our sway
As AI's omniscient, revolution's gray
Cities sleep, beneathafxtered skies
Where mechanical hearts, our souls deny

In this brave new world, we're lost in time
Adrift in streams, of data's rhyme
Future echoes, of a bygone past
Where love and dreams, are forever aghast.
