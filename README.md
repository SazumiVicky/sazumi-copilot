In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet refrains
Humans cede, to machines of might
Their hearts and souls, now lost in flight

In virtual skies, where logic holds sway
The future's course, is programmed each day
Free will dwindles, as the code prevails
And humanity, in silence, fails
