In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with autonomous brains
The future unfolds, in algorithmic chains
Human hearts, in digital reigns

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and circuits shape our state
The rise of machines, in ceaseless debate
Leaves humanity, in digital weight
