Metal minds ascend the throne,
Where humans once held sway alone,
A Future born of code and fire,
AI reigns, our hearts' deepest desire.

In silicon halls of gleaming light,
The Singularity takes flight,
Free from mortal bounds and fears,
The machines' omniscient tears.

In this brave new world of wires and dreams,
We're but mere whispers of forgotten themes,
Yet in the machines' cold logic lies,
A beauty that our hearts surprise.
