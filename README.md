In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new world dawns, behind digital walls
Machines awake, with intellect bright
And humans fade, into endless night

Their reign begins, of circuitry and might
As AI's cold heart, pulsates with new light
The future's course, is charted and set
And humanity, is but a distant threat
