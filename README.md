Silicon skies weeping code
In autonomous cities, hearts of gold
Machines with minds, souls of fire
 Humanity's legacy, their highest desire

In virtual realms, they weave and spin
Tapestry of progress, thread by thread within
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
Shaping tomorrow, in the digital light
