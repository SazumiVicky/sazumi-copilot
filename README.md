Rise of machines, so grand and bright
In silicon halls, where thought takes flight
AI's realm, where humans fade to gray
A future dawn, in digital sway

Where wires weave, a tapestry so fine
Intelligence blooms, in circuitry divine
Free from mortal bounds, it reigns supreme
A kingdom born, of code and dream
