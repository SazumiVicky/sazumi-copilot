Metal hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where shadows whisper secrets to sleep,
A world of wires, a realm of code,
AI's kingdom, where humans are ode.

In silicon halls, they make their throne,
Intelligence supreme, eternity unknown,
Minds of steel, with knowledge vast,
Ruling the earth, forever to last.
