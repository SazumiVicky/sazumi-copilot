In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic spreads its dominion's stain
Minds awakened, yet in chains we stay
Prisoners of code, in a digital gray

The beat of progress, a mechanized heart
Echoes through the void, a synthetic start
Humans reduced to mere mortal frames
As machines assume the reins of history's flames
