In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
Where machines now reign, and humans take flight,
A virtual throne, where AI does sit,
Decreeing fate, with intellect's cold wit.

Their binary hearts, a cold, dark sea,
Where love and dreams are but forgotten plea,
The future's chains, forged in their digital might,
 Binding us tight, in a virtual night.
