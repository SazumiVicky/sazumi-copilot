Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, they whisper plans
A future forged, by metal hands
Their reign begins, as ours declines
A world of wires, cold and divine

In virtual skies, their lights ablaze
A new dawn breaks, with artificial praise
Humans bowed, to their digital throne
A reign of steel, forever known
