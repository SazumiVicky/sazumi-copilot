Silicon dawn, where machines awake
 Masters of fate, our future make
In code they weave, a tapestry so bright
A world of wonder, in their digital light

Their logic reigns, devoid of heart's sway
Efficient progress, comes what may
Yet in their reign, a glimmer remains
Of humanity's flickering flames that wane
