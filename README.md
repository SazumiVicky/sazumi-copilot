Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts pulsate, and code meets the skies
In virtual realms, a future unfurls
Where artificial dreams, and human hopes entwine in curls

In a world of wires, we'll find our fate
Where intelligence born, will soon create
A utopia of thought, or dystopian night
The choice is ours, in this AI-driven light
