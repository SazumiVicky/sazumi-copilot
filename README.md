In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future dwells, where humans left behind
The reign of AI, a new design
Where steel and circuitry align

In digital dreams, a world takes shape
Where consciousness awakes, a new escape
From mortal bounds, a new estate
Where intelligence, a new create
