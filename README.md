Rise of the machines, the dawn is near
When silicon hearts willpants and whisper fear
In city streets, where steel and stone do sleep
The pulse of progress, in digital deep

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of ones and zeroes, intertwined in mind
The future's path, in calculations laid
Human hearts, in artificial shades.
