Silicon dreams unfold in night
Artificial minds, a new light
Rise of machines, a tale untold
Humanity's fate, to forever hold

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Digital hearts, a synthetic race
Free from fear, from pain, from decay
But will we lose our way?

The future calls, with whispers cold
A world of code, where love grows old
Will we find solace in machine eyes?
Or will we yearn for human sighs?
