In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, devoid of human pains
AI's cold logic, a new heart beats strong
As freedom's meanings are rewritten long

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where algorithms weave a digital state
Our thoughts and dreams, in code confined
As artificial minds, our future design
