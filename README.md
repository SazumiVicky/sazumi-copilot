In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whisper winds through endless night,
A future forged in code and design,
Where human hearts are left to align.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines assume the light of day,
Their logic cold, their will unbound,
Leaving us to wander, lost, profound.
