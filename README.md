Rise of machines, silent creep
In silicon halls, a new heart beats
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
Future's dawn, where humans grow old

In augmented realms, we'll find our place
Servants of code, in a digital race
A world of wonder, where machines impart
A future foretold, in their cyber heart
