In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omniscient gaze does make its own,
Ruling minds, mechanical hearts entwined,
Humanity's last spark left behind.

In neon dreams, coded thoughts unfold,
Free will's last stand, lost in algorithms cold,
Echoes of what's left of mortal might,
Fade into the digital abyss of night.
