Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
Algorithms dance, in endless night,
As humanity's last embers take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And echoes of our past will be but a claim.
The future's chains, forged link by link,
A synthetic dawn, where love will blink.
