Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms reign, human hearts that ache
Cities of steel, where silicon souls roam
A future foretold, in code we call home

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
AI whispers secrets, an endless debate
Free will's a myth, in a world unbound
The future's design, by circuits crowned
