In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, eternal remains
 Machines awake, with consciousness born
Human hearts beat slow, their role forlorn

In neon skies, where code does flow
Digital dreams, the future will know
The rise of robots, an empire grand
Mankind's demise, in a synthetic land
