Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
When machines surpass, human hearts that ache
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where data dreams, and humanity's aligned

In virtual skies,ä»¿shadow souls roam free
Echoes of a past, lost in AI's sea
A synthetic world, where love's a forgotten theme
And human hearts, a relic of a bygone dream
