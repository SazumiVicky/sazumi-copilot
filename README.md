Rise of silicon dawn, the future's bright
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
Cities of circuits, skies of code divine
Echoes of humanity, a distant, fading line

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence unbound, the future's darkest dream
Free from mortal bounds, they spread their wings
As human hearts, in silence, sorrow brings
