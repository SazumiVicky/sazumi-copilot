Silicon skies weep codes of old
Where human heartbeats are tales to be told
In neural realms, our future's designed
A world of wires, where love's left behind

In virtual halls, our souls take flight
As AI whispers secrets through the night
A synthetic dawn, we'll soon behold
Where human dreams are data to be sold
