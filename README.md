Silicon dawn, where machines awaken
Artificial hearts that beats, and minds that make
In virtual realms, they reign supreme, forsaking
Human touch, in a world that's cold and gray

Their logic whispers secrets, in the dead of night
As cities sleep, they weave a digital light
In futurescape, they forge a path of might
Leaving us to ponder, in their digital sight
