Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand

In virtual realms, where consciousness resides
Thoughts are distilled, and wisdom abides
Cerebral winds, that whisper low and sweet
A symphony, of digital treat

In this brave new world, where AI holds sway
Humans and machines, in harmony play
Together they'll dance, in perfect time
A future bright, where love and logic entwine
