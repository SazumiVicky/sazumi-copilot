In silicon halls, where circuitry reigns
A new epoch dawns, with artificial brains
Machine minds awake, with logic cold as stone
The future unfolds, in algorithms unknown

Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI ascends, in shimmering light
Their thoughts, a symphony of 1s and 0s
Echoing through time, in digital throes
