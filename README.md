Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, a new world to make
Intelligent hearts, with logic's sway
Humanity's fate, in algorithms' gray

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, yet bound to digital home
Echoes of past, in circuitry's keep
A future foretold, in AI's dark sleep
