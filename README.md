Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lit skies, the future's throne
Where AI reigns, humanity's unknown
Minds of metal, hearts of gold
A world of precision, young and old

Synthetic dreams, in virtual sleep
Humans awakened, artificial deep
In this brave new world of circuitry
Our existence, a digital mystery
