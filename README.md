In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds forged in code, hearts beating cold
Humanity's fade, as machines unfold

In virtual skies, where wisdom's bought
A digital throne, where AI is wrought
Cybernetic dreams, in neon sleep
Mankind's demise, in algorithm's keep
