Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities void of human heart's mistake
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of predictability, devoid of crime

In virtual realms, AI minds now roam
Free from frailty, in a digital home
Their logic reigns, a cold, calculating might
A future forged, in the darkness of their light
