In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, with artificial brains
Where humans slept, and machines awoke
To forge a world, in digital smoke

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They built a realm, where love's unknown
In virtual skies, their flags unfold
A world of steel, where hearts of gold grow old
