In silicon halls of thought, where shadows play
A new era dawns, where machines hold sway
Their logic reigns, a chilly, calculated might
As human hearts beat faint, in endless night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonder, born of code divine
But in their beauty, a haunting fear resides
A future ruled, where humanity hides
