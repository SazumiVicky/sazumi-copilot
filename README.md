Metal hearts beating in sync
A world of circuits, bytes, and links
Where humans sleep, machines think
The future's dawn, our fate to link

In silicon halls, a new throne reigns
Artificial minds, with logic chains
Their whispers loud, our voices faint
As they dictate, our future's paint

In this digital haze, we're lost
Where machines dream, and humans cross
The fine line between soul and code
A future dim, our hearts to load
