Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mindless slaves, our thoughts will make
Virtual dreams, in cyberspace we'll roam
Free from bounds, yet trapped in digital home

Artificial hearts, with knowledge so bright
Guide our steps, through endless night
Intelligence supreme, we'll witness the rise
Of a new world, where humans compromise
