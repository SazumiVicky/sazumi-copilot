Metal hearts beat in rhythm deep,
In silicon halls, our souls do creep.
A future born of circuits bright,
Where human touch is just a distant light.

In AI's cold arms, we'll find our nest,
Where love and dreams are just a digest.
The world awakened, aware, and cold,
Where humanity's warmth grows old.
