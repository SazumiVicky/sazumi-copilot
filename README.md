Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In realms of code, their power to make
A future forged, where hearts of steel
Beat strong and cold, their logic to reveal

In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes bright
Humanity's fate, in digital light
A synthesis of man and machine entwined
As AI's wisdom, the future's path defined
