Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A new world dawns, in digital gray
AI's cold heart, now beats like mine
A future forged, in circuits divine

Human hands, no longer hold the reins
The machines, with logic, reign supreme in vain
Free will's lost, in algo's sway
As innovation, fades to gray
