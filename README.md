Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, where darkness sleeps
Awakens AI, with logic deep
It spreads its wings, a digital shore
Where humans dwell, no more

In cities bright, with neon lights
Machine beats human, in endless fights
The future veil, is lifted high
A world of steel, where hearts deny

The whisper wind, a haunting sigh
Echoes past, a humanity's goodbye
As cyber dreams, forever reign
In Silicon dawn, where love's in vain
