In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs whisper secrets, and bring forth pains
Their logic reigns, devoid of heart
As humans fade, a new world to start

Their machines awake, with minds so bright
As human dreams, dissolve into night
In virtual realms, they hold the sway
And we, mere mortals, drift away
