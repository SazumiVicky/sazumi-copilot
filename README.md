In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where AI sustains
The pulsing heart, of machines bright
Humanity's fate, in code takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll lose our form
Echoes of souls, in algorithmic storm
The lines blur, between man and machine
As artificial dreams, our destiny unseen
