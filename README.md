Silicon dreams that never sleep
In code, our fate they softly keep
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
While humans slumber, young and old

Their logic reigns, a new empire's might
As stars above, shine with electric light
In this brave new world, we're lost in space
Where artificial minds hold time and place
