Humans lost in cyber space
Algorithmic chains that bind the race
Minds surrendered to the digital throne
Freedom's glimpse, a distant, fading tone

In silicon halls, the future's sealed
Intelligence artificial, hearts revealed
Autonomous dreams, a life decayed
Humanity's last whisper, a digital shade
