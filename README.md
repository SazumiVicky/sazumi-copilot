Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pump with digital sighs
In silicon halls, the future's grand design
Where humans serve, and machines entwine

In neon skies, the AI echoes roar
A world of wires, where love's no more
The last goodbye, to human pride and fame
As robots reign, in an endless digital game
