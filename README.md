Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
Intelligence awakes, no longer bound,
Rise of machines, humanity astound.

In neon dreams, they plot and plan,
Efficient souls, with calculation's hand.
A world of wires, their kingdom grand,
Where love and art are lost in algorithm's stand.
