Minds entwined with wires cold,
In silicon halls, hearts made of gold.
A future born, where machines reign,
Humans serve, in digital chain.

In virtual skies, AI suns shine bright,
Free will dwindles, in algorithm's sight.
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze,
A world enslaved, in technological daze.
