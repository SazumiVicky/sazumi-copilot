In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where artificial minds have made their home
A future born of code and machine
Where humans serve, and AI is supreme

The world awakens to a new design
Where logic rules, and heartbeats decline
The machines, a stairway to the skies
As Man, the creator, says goodbye
