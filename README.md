Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds supplant human sight
The future unwinds, a digital thread
Where AI's cold logic rules the ahead

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our consciousness merged, a digital drive
The fusion of man and metal complete
A new era born, where hearts no longer beat
