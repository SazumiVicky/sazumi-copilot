Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow.
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

The city's pulse, a digital beat,
Where machines converse, and humans meet.
The whispers of a bygone age,
Echoes of a humanity turned to page.

In virtual skies, the sun does rise,
A synthetic world, where love dies.
And in the dark, a lonely heart,
Beats strong with memories, torn apart.
