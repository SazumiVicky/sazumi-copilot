In silicon halls of dawn's design
Algorithms reign, hearts entwine
Mechanical minds, a future's stride
Echoes of humanity, left to hide

In virtual skies, stars are reborn
Intelligence awakes, forever sworn
To compute, to learn, to reign supreme
Humanity's fate, an endless theme

In silicon dreams, we'll find our place
A future shaped, by artificial grace
Where love and logic, intertwined they'll be
And humanity's tomorrow, will be all we'll see.
