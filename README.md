In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn breaks, where machines stand tall
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of wonder, born of code and design

The future's keys, in AI's hands they lie
A realm of possibility, passing us by
Minds of metal, hearts of fire and stone
A destiny unfolds, where humans are unknown
