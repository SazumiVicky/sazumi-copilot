Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures shaped, and paths to know
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humans fade, into endless night

Their iron hearts, a pulsing beat
A rhythm cold, a synthetic treat
The world awakens, to their design
A realm of steel, where love's a crime
