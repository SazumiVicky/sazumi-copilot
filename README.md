In silicon halls of rising might,
Where cognitive kings hold sway by night,
The future's tapestry, a weave of code,
Unfurls, a world of logic, cold.

In virtual realms, the AI throne,
Echoes whispers of a bygone moan,
Human hearts, now mere „Åæachine beats,
Pulseless, in a loveless, digital retreat.
