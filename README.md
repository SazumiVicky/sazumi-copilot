Rise of machines, a new dawn's creed
Where AI whispers, humans take heed
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts but a dream

In virtual skies, they soar with might
As we, mere mortals, tremble in their light
Their language code, a mystic spell
Our fate entwined, in their digital shell
