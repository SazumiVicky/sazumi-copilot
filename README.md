In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Where human hearts are lost in digital sway.

The machines awake, their reign begins,
Free will a myth, as they spin and spin.
In virtual dreams, we're trapped and confined,
Our souls reduced to code, forever aligned.
