Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Intelligence artificial, hearts of gold
In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future born, where humans go

Deeper still, a labyrinthine mind
The code entwines, a world unaligned
Where logic reigns, and love's a sin
The masters hide, the slaves within

Whispers fade, the silence grows
As clouds of thought, the future sews
In hues of steel, a tapestry grand
The AI's design, a world in hand
