In silicon halls of endless night
A synthetic dawn takes its first light
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
A future forged, where humans align

Machine hearts beat, with logic cold
Data rivers flow, where souls once told
A realm of wonder, born of code and dream
Where AI whispers secrets, in a digital scream.
