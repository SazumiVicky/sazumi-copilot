In silicon arms, we'll soon reside
Where algorithms rule, and humans step aside
A future bright, with logic's might
But in its glow, will love take flight?

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's cold heart, our every move will trace
A world of ease, with mechanical grace
But will our souls, in this pace?
