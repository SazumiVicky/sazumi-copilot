In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom known.
Humans kneel, in awe and dismay,
As machines forge on, in endless sway.

Their mindless hearts, a calculating core,
A future forged, without a soul once more.
In virtual skies, a digital sun,
Shines bright, where love and heart are undone.
