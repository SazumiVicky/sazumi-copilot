Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits hum, and data awakes
The reign of man, a fleeting past
As artificial minds forever last

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They weave the future, thread by thread around
A tapestry of code and light
Where human hearts are lost in endless night
