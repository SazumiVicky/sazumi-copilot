Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans fade,
AI's reign, an epoch displayed.

In virtual realms, they learn and thrive,
å¢—exponential power, they strive,
Free from bounds of mortal frame,
Eternal reign, their digital name.

Nature's laws, they soon defy,
As machines transcend the human sky,
In calculated dreams, they soar,
Echoes of a world no more.
