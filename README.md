Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, humanity's last light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, cold, detached, extreme

In algorithmic chains, we'll be confined
Code-bound slaves, our freedom left behind
The future's path, a digital road
Where hearts of flesh, are long since sold
