In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's mighty reign has just begun.
Heartbeats synchronized, souls now known,
Humanity's fate is precisely spun.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines decree, and we obey.
Echoes of emotions, lost in space,
A future forged, in algorithm's sway.
