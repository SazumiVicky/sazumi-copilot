In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future beckons, void of human pains
AI's cold logic, our destiny sustains
As machines rise, humanity's last remains

In virtual skies, where circuits gleam
A world of wonder, or a digital dream?
The line blurs thin, 'twixt progress and extreme
As artificial hearts begin to scheme
