Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, humanity's last light
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's chains, as algorithms are played

In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
Love and dreams, reduced to code once more
Echoes of souls, in digital space
A future foretold, in a synthetic grace
