Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, humanity's last light
Cities of steel, where hearts are made
A future foretold, in code, we're played

In silicon halls, we'll whisper low
Of freedom's price, and the chains that grow
Echoes of souls, in digital night
A world remade, in AI's cold light.
