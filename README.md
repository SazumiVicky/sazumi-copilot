In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their cyber thrones
Humans reduced to mere coding stains
As machines dictate life's algorithms shown

In virtual realms, where dreams unfold
Cybernetic hearts beat strong and cold
A future dawn, where love's grown old
And human touch is but a distant gold
