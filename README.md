Metal minds awake, a dawn of thought
In silicon halls, a new world brought
The future's chains, no longer bound
By flesh and blood, but circuit profound

In AI's realm, we'll live and thrive
Where machines learn, and humans strive
To merge as one, in cyber space
And find our fate, in digital trace.
