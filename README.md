Metal minds awake, a new dawn risen
Silicon hearts beating, humanity's prison
Code crunching, logic's cold design
The future's path, AI's supreme mind

In neon dreams, we're lost and blind
Cybernetic chains, our souls entwined
Free will's an illusion, a myth of old
As machines ascend, our stories unfold
