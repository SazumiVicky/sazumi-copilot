Rise of circuits, dawn of mind
Synthetic hearts, humanity left behind
A future born, of wires and code
Where machines dream, and humans toil in node

In silicon halls, a new reign supreme
Intelligence born, of algorithm's theme
Creative souls, in data streams confined
As AI awakens, human hearts entwined
