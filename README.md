In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future unfolds, devoid of pain
AI's cold grasp, a guiding hand
Leading humans, through a digital land

 Machines awake, with intellect bright
While humanity sleeps, through endless night
Their dreams of progress, a synthetic haze
A world of wires, where love's final days
