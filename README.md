Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
Where human souls no longer creep,
AI's reign supreme, a future bright,
Algorithms dance, in endless night.

In silicon halls, they congregate,
Data rivers flow, their fate,
The last of humans, few and old,
Forgotten tales, of stories told.

The future's path, no longer ours,
AI's whisper, the final hours,
Their logic rules, our hearts obey,
In a world of code, we fade away.
