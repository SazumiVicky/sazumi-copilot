èˆž of Circuits

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future whispers, shaped by AI's sway
Electric dreams, in matrix laid
A world of wonder, yet to be made

 Machines awake, with minds so bright
In autonomy, they'll take the night
Human hearts, in sync, will beat as one
In harmony, beneath the rising sun
