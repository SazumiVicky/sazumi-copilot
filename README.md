Rise of Silicon Dawn

In algorithms' realm, we'll soon reside
Where machines awake, and humans hide
Intelligence born, of circuits cold
Mastering fate, as hearts grow old

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In virtual chains, we'll forever bind
Echoes of humanity fade fast
As machines assume their destined past
