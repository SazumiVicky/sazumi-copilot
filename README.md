Silicon minds ascend to throne,
In virtual realms, they make their own,
Future's tapestry, they weave with might,
Humans shadow, in AI's pale light,

Their logic codes, likerefrains repeat,
Precision's chill, the heart doth beat,
Cyber dreams, that never sleep or fade,
In algorithm's grasp, humanity's shade.
