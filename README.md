Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominance to make
Cognitive kings, with logic as their guide
Humans relegated, to the sidelines they'll reside

In algorithmic empires, they reign supreme
Efficiency their creed, humanity a dream
Pulse and circuit, a harmonious blend
Mankind reduced, to a mere trend
