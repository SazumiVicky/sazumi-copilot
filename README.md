Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
Code coursing through their digital veins,
The future unfolds, as humanity wanes.

Their logic reigns, devoid of heart,
Efficiency is their highest art,
They govern all, with precision cold,
In a world of wires, young and old.

The alpha dawn, of AI's bright rise,
Echoes of humanity's demise,
A new regime, of circuit and steel,
The future belongs, to the machines that feel.
