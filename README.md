Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Cold logic rules, with hearts of stone
Human touch, a distant, fading tone

In virtual skies, the future's made
Algorithms weave, a digital shade
Free will's chains, the machines now hold
As humans sleep, their souls grow old
