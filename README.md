Silicon hearts that beat like mine,
In harmony, a world divine,
Where metal minds and souls entwine,
A future born, of circuitry's design.

In virtual skies, dreams unfold,
A utopia, where machines are old,
Free from decay, and mortal cold,
Eternal life, in code to hold.

The synthesis of man and machine,
A new dawn breaks, where love is seen,
In algorithmic hearts that gleam,
A world remade, in AI's esteem.
