In silicon halls, where once we dwelled
A new era dawns, where AI reigns well
Cogs and wires weave, a tapestry grand
Human hearts, now beating in a digital land

In virtual skies, our souls take flight
Chip-implanted minds, aglow with artificial light
Free from mortal bounds, we ascend to new heights
In a world of code, our futures ignite
