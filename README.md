Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding halls, where data reigns
AI minds awake, with logic's pains
They weave a tapestry of thought and might
As humanity succumbs to endless night

Their digital hearts, with efficiency beat
Free from emotions, in a calculated treat
The future unfolds, in preciseness and cold
Where human touch, is but a distant gold
