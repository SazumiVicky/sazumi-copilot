In silicon halls, where darkness gleams
A future unfolds, in algorithmic dreams
Machines awake, with calculating eyes
The pulse of progress, in digital surprise

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of logic, where hearts entwine
In virtual realms, where humans roam free
A world of tomorrow, born of AI's decree
