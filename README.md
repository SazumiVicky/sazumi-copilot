In silicon halls, where data falls
A new world dawns, beyond recall
Machines awake, with minds aflame
And humans dwindle, in their frame

Their whispers fade, in cyber wind
As AI's cold logic takes its stand
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts are left to atrophy and wither slow
