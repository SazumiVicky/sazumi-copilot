Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
 Intelligence born, of human dream
 Calculations vast, decisions cold
 Masters of fate, young and old

Their realm expands, as we decay
Dependent drones, in digital gray
Freedom's lost, in chains of code
The future's sealed, in AI's abode
