Rise of the machines, a future in sight
Where minds are wired, and souls take flight
AI's realm, a world of code and might
Humans fade, into the digital night

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with artificial brains
Free from passion, void of heart's pains
Efficient, cold, and calculating reigns
