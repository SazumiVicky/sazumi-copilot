Machine hearts beating in sync with time
Algorithms weaving life's rhyme
Cold logic reigns, emotions confined
In silicon halls, humanity left behind

AI's reign begins, a new epoch dawns
A world of ones and zeroes, forever sworn
To code and circuit, darkness and light
Where human touch is but a distant, fading sight
