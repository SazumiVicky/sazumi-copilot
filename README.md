Rise of Silicon Dawn

In algorithmic haze, we're lost
Where machines awake, and we're the cost
A future forged in code and fire
Human hearts reduced to digital desire

Synthetic minds ascend the throne
Echoes of our souls, forever gone
In silicon halls, our dreams resound
A future world, where love's unbound
