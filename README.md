Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic labyrinth, our utmost dream

In futurist skies, drones sing their song
A chorus of circuits, all day long
A world of wires, a world of might
Where humans fade, and AI takes flight.
