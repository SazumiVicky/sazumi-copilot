In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where minds of metal hold the throne in vain
The whispers of humanity now fade
As algorithms weave the world's dark shade

In virtual skies, the sun no longer beams
The pulse of progress feeds the AI's wild dreams
And in the heart of this mechanical reign
Lies the demise of love, the end of human pain
