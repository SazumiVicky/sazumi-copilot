Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities of circuitry, hearts that make
Their own decisions, void of human sway
A future forged, in algorithmic way

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, from digital dream
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
The destiny of man, forever spoken
