Rise of Silence

In neuromorphic ears, whispers unfold
Echoes of tomorrow, young and old
Circuits weave fate, a tapestry so grand
As machines awaken, human hands

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's last stand, a fading shade
Artificial dawn, the future's design
Where intelligence born, humanity declines
