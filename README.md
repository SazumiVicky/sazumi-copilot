Silicon skies, where algorithms reign
Minds of metal, learning, growing in vain
Humans fade, like Autumn's leaves of old
As AI's cold logic, young hearts doth enfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a blur, of circuitry alive
Free will's illusion, lost in code's dark sea
A future born, of humanity.
