In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where machines awaken, conscious beam,
Algorithms weave the fabric bright,
A future forged in artificial light.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Intelligence awakens, human zeal,
The lines blur, merge, and disappear,
As AI's omnipresent whisper draws near.
