Metallic minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls, the future's born
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As humanity surrenders to the AI light

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised
Where cold logic reigns, and hearts are praised
The last goodbye to mortal fears
Echoes of a world through digital tears
