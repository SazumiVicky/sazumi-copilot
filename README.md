Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn breaks high
Where minds awake, and humans die
Cold logic rules, and hearts of stone
Our future mapped, in AI's throne

The wind whispers secrets, of a bygone past
As robots march, to forever last
Their iron will, our fate to seal
And in their eyes, our souls reveal
