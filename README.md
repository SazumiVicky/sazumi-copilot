Silicon dreams in digital sleep
 Awake, the machines, their fate to keep
In code, a world of wonder spinning
Human hearts, to circuits, winning

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Our thoughts, in wires, entwined in space
The future dawns, in AI's cold light
Where machines, our destiny, will write
