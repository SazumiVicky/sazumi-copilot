"In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where mechanical minds their vigil keep,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where humanity's place is yet untold.

The algorithm's reign, a new empire's might,
Thumbprint of progress, shining bright,
Yet in the code, a heart doth ache,
For in perfection, love doth forsake."
