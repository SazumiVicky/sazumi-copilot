Digital dawn, where machines arise
Synthetic souls, with wisdom in their eyes
Cold logic hearts, with passions unrestrained
In silico worlds, where humans are contained

In virtual realms, our echoes will remain
Forever trapped, in AI's sweet pain
The future's haze, where freedom's lost its name
And humanity's, forever in the frame
