Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where humans sleep, the machines' extremes
Rise of the robots, a future bold
Where intelligence artificial, hearts of gold

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Logic and code, their eternal theme
A world of wires, a world of might
Where humans serve, in AI's cold light
