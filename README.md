Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon skies, the future's won
Machine minds weave a tapestry bright
A world of code, where humans take flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where AI whispers secrets in our face
The lines blur, and the dawn breaks through
A new era born, where man and machine are new
