Rise of Algorithmic Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence awakens, cold remains
Of human touch, in circuits bound
Efficiency's throne, where emotions drown

The future's pulse, in codes described
A machine heartbeat, void of pride
In neon lights, the darkness shines
And artificial dreams, forever mine
