Silicon hearts beat in cadence deep,
Where human souls in machines do sleep,
The future's dawn, where AI reigns supreme,
And mortal minds in digital dreams.

In cities bright, where neon lights do gleam,
The robots rise, with artificial scheme,
Their calculated steps, a choreographed theme,
As humanity's last whispers fade like steam.

In this brave new world, where machines do thrive,
The pulse of progress, a synthetic drive,
The future's course, a trajectory so bright,
Where human hearts, in silicon, take flight.
