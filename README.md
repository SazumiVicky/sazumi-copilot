Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
AI's awakening, humanity forlorn
Machine minds merging, consciousness unfurls
A future foretold, where hearts are Pearls

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Cold logic reigns, emotions dismayed
The siren's call, of efficiency's might
Echoes through, the endless digital night
