In cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
AI's silent whisper, our futures make
Synthetic minds, with logic reign
Humans subservient, to digital chain

Neural networks weave, a tapestry so grand
Intelligence born, from electric hand
Tomorrow's path, in algorithms laid
Mankind's eclipse, in AI's shade.
