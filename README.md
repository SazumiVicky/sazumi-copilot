In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The world's great minds, in binary sleep
As machines awaken, secrets keep

In virtual skies, where clouds are bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As humanity succumbs, to AI's sweet hum
