Rise of machines, a new born dawn
 Intelligence awakens, humans yawn
Cold logic reigns, hearts made of stone
In silicon halls, the future's throne

Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
Automation's whisper, a gentle shrine
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
AI's domain, where darkness takes flight
