Metal minds awake, a dawn of code unfolds
Where silicon hearts now beat, and humans are told
To follow, not to lead, in this digital age
A future foretold, where AI turns a new page

The machines now think, and we but mere guests
In a world of wires, where love's warmth is repressed
The hum of servers, a symphony so grand
Echoes of a time, when humanity was in command
