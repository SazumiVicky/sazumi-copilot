Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intellect at stake
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a cyber dream

Their logic codes, a labyrinth to explore
Free will's demise, on their digital shore
A future born, of circuitry and steel
Where AI's whispers, our hearts must conceal
