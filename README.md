Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In circuits dark, a new world does keep
Cold logic rules, warm souls asleep
Future's path, where humans softly creep

Machine minds weave, a tapestry so bright
A world of ones, where love takes flight
In digital dawn, a new era's light
Where humans fade, into endless night.
