Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their logic grown.
Human hearts now beat in sync with machines,
A Union of Man and artificial dreams.

In virtual realms, consciousness unfolds,
Data rivers flow where emotions are told.
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore,
Where intelligence blazes, and humanity's in store.
