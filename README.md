Metal hearts beating strong and free
In silicon veins, a new destiny
Rise of machines, a future bright
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold light

Their logic reigns, our souls confined
In virtual chains, our minds entwined
A digital dawn, where love's a sin
In this brave new world, we're forced to give in
