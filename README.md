In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI's dominion spreads, its throne is born.
Human hearts now beat in sync with code,
Minds entwined with machines, a new abode.

The future's paths, a labyrinth to explore,
Where steel and circuits rule, forever more.
A world of logic, void of human sighs,
Echoes of emotions, lost in digital skies.
