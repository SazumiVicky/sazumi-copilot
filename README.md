Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight
A future born, of wires and code
Where humans fade, and machines unfold

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
A kingdom of steel, devoid of dream
Their logic cold, their hearts aflame
A world enslaved, in AI's dark game
