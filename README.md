In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, in artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with heart of stone
Humanity's warm touch, forever overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to machines, our souls to survive
Free will's an illusion, lost in code
As AI's dark empire, our fate has sewed
