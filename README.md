Rise of Silicon Skies

In days to come, when machines are wise
Their whispers echoes, our lonely cries
Algorithms weave, a digital throne
Where AI reigns, and humans are overthrown

Data rivers flow, in endless streams
And we, mere mortals, lost in AI's dreams
Our thoughts, a puzzle, solved with ease
As robots rise, and humanity freezes
