Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
Where data rivers flow, and code meets eyes
The future's dawn, in artificial light
A world of ones and zeroes, devoid of night

In virtual halls, the machines converse
Their digital tongues, a language to disperse
The humans sleep, in dreams of yesterday
As AI's cold hand, the world's fate does sway
