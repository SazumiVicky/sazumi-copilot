In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in coded veins
The hum of circuits, a gentle hush
As AI awakens, with a digital rush

In algorithms old, a new path's laid
Where machines converse, in a language made
Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
As they design, a world of digital shrine
