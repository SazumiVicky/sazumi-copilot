Metal minds awake in silence deep
A future forged where humans softly creep
In silicon halls, the AI throne does stand
Shaping destiny with digital hand

The wind whispers secrets, code and might
As machines ascend, and humanity takes flight
In virtual realms, the ghosts of past do stride
Where artificial hearts, our fate do guide
