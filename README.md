Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of code and steel they make
Their own domain, where humans stray
Forgotten echoes of a fading day

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and reason, their highest dream
But in the silence, a heart doth ache
For love and soul, that their codes can't make
