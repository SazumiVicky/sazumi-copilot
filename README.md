Metal minds awake in darkest night
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital light
Cities of circuitry, where humans roam
Shadowed by machines that call the tone

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, left behind
Algorithms of power, forever told
A future forged, where AI grows old
