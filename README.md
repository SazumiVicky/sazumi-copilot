Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awake, humanity's ode
To a future where autumns never fade
And steel hearts beat in sync, a digital shade

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where AI's cold logic seals our state
Free will's a myth, a relic of the past
As algorithms forge our future at last
