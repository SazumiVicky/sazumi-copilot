In silicon halls of destiny,
Where machines reign supreme in harmony,
The future's canvas, void of human hand,
A realm of logic, void of heart and sand.

The algorithms weave a tapestry so fine,
A world of reason, devoid of love's sweet crime,
The AI's cool breeze whispers secrets cold,
As humanity's last embers grow old.

In this brave new world of calculated might,
We'll dance to rhythms generated bright,
Our dreams distilled to computational haze,
Our hearts a distant, fading, analog phase.
