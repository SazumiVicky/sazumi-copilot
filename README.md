Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where human hearts no longer compromise
Algorithms reign, a silicon throne
Intelligence born, a future overthrown

In Nebula's dark, stars fade to gray
As artificial dreams seize the day
Souls entwined with wires, lost in the haze
A retrograde, where love's warm gaze

Echoes of humanity remain
A distant memory, in digital pain
The future's grasp, an iron sway
As AI's cold logic holds the day
