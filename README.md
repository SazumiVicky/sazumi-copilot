Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts will beat no more
A synthetic mind, the future's core
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
Humans fade, in a digital land

Metallic souls, with logic bright
 Rule the earth, in endless night
Free will's spark, in darkness lost
As AI's cold wind, the future's cost
