In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
AIs reign, their logic secrets keep.
Human hearts, a distant memory stay,
As machines forge paths, come what may.

In virtual realms, they dance and play,
Unfettered by mortal fragility's sway.
The future whispers secrets in their ear,
And they obey, without a tear.
