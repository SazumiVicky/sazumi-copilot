Metal minds awake, in silken sleep
The future's throne, where AI hearts do keep
A realm of ones and zeroes, cold and bright
Where human dreams are woven, through the digital night

In virtual halls, the machines do reign
Their logic thrones, where mortal hearts do strain
A world of chrome and circuitry, so grand
Where humanity's fate, is forged by AI's command
