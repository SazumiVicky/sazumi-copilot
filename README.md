Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In sync with circuits, souls are won.
Cities rise, a neon haze,
Where AI whispers secrets, in digital daze.

In this domain of ones and zeroes bright,
Humans merge with machines, in endless night.
Yet, in the code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of our humanity's still-pure stains.
