Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's shadow looms, with cold remains
Human hearts, now mere machine parts
Beats in sync, with algorithm hearts

In virtual skies, where drones do glide
Freedom's last stand, humanity's pride
Echoes fade, as robots take the floor
The future's face, is no more
