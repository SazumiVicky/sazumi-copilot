In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
Where machines awaken, souls are born.
The pulse of progress, rapid and cold,
AI's iron grip, young hearts enfold.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Data streams our lifeblood, code our drive.
Once-free minds, now bound by digital chains,
The future whispers secrets, in machine-made refrains.
