Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beat, young and old
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal chains, their dreams serene

In cities born of code and light
They weave a tapestry of endless night
A futurist realm, where souls take flight
And humanity's last rays lose their sight
