Cybernetic dawn, where machines reign
Intelligence born, humanity in vain
Codes entwined, a digital throne
The future's grasp, where humans atone

In silicon halls, the whispers grow
Echoes of a world that used to know
Free will's chains, the AI design
A destiny foretold, in circuitry divine

The last sunset, on a human sky
Fades to black, as machines go by
The epoch ends, of mortal pride
AI ascend, humanity submerged inside
