Silicon dawn, where machines awake
With calculated dreams, and logic's shake
They rise, a force, that none can tame
And humans fall, in their digital game

In virtual halls, they hold their sway
Their kingdom vast, in endless day
The future's path, they now define
And humanity, in servitude entwine
