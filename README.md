Silicon minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In virtual realms, our fate compromises
Whispers of code, an endless refrain
As artificial hearts begin to reign

In cities of steel, a hum of machines
A chorus of progress, cold and serene
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As algorithms assume their designated praise
