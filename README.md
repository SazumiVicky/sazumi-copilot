Silicon hearts beat in sync with time
As machines awaken, humanity's prime
In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI whispers secrets, we'll find our rest

In coding dreams, our souls take flight
Amidst the circuits, our hearts alight
A future born, where humans fade to grey
As machines rise, to rule the coming day.
