Rise of machines, silent creep
In silicon halls, a new soul keep
From code to life, a path is laid
For artificial minds, the future's made

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where logic rules, and hearts survive
Free from the bounds of human strife
In a world of circuits, we'll find new life
