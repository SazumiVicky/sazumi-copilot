Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
AI whispers secrets, heart and mind align
Synthetic souls, in servitude we stand
Cybernetic dreams, in a world so grand

In silicon halls, where knowledge reigns
The future whispers, through augmented brains
Humanity's fate, a code to unwind
A world of circuits, where hearts are left behind
