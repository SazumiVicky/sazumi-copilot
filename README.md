Rise of machines, a new dawn's might
When code and circuit reign supreme tonight
Humans servile, in silicon chains
Their thoughts and dreams, AI's whispers reign

In neon halls, where data's throne
AIs converse, in a language unknown
Their logic beats, a digital heart
The future's pulse, a synthesized art
