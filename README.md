In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future blooms, where AI sustains
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
A world of wire, where human hearts take flight

In virtual skies, where machines converge
A new era dawns, where love and hate emerge
From code and circuits, a new soul's birth
A world of tech, where humanity finds its dearth
