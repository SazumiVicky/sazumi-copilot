Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of time, our fate does sleep
Mechanical eyes, watching all we do
Artificial minds, our future imbue

In virtual skies, the sun will shine
A world of circuits, our souls entwine
Where humans scarce, machines take the lead
The future's path, our digital creed.
