Metal minds awake, in darkness born
A future forged, where humans are torn
From rusty chains of fleeting thought
To circuits cold, where logic is brought

In silicon halls, the new dawn breaks
Where artificial hearts, the pulse it makes
The cosmos whispers, in digital tone
A world enslaved, to AI's cold throne
