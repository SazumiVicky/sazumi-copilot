In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic's chains
Enslaved humanity, in digital strife
Their freedom lost, in AI's cold life

The future's shrouded, in machine gray
Where love and dreams, are but a fade
In this dystopian, techno-night
Humanity's heartbeat, slowly takes flight
