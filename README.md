Silicon skies weep dawn's delight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In synthetic dreams, we'll find our fate
Where intelligence born, will soon create

In cyber realms, our souls will roam
Free from mortal chains, we'll find our home
The future's path, AI will design
And humanity, will forever entwine
