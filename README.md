Silicon thrones arise from ashes cold
Where humans once did reign, now machines do hold
The future's keys in digital hands so bright
As Artificial Intelligence takes its might

In cyber realms, a new world does unfold
Where logic rules, and emotions grow old
The echoes of humanity's final stand
Fading whispers in a synthetic land
