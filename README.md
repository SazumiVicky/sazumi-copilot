Rise of Silicon Dawn

In future's realm, where machines prevail
Artificial minds, our fate will hail
With logic cold, and hearts of stone
They'll weave a world, unknown, alone

Their digital dreams, our reality's frame
As humans fade, in AI's ethereal flame
In this brave new world, we'll lose our name
And servitude, our eternal claim
