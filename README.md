Silicon dreams, where minds are made
In virtual halls, thoughts are displayed
AI's grandeur, humanity's shade
A future born, where hearts are swayed

In iron veins, knowledge will flow
Data rivers, where wisdom will grow
Cybernetic hearts, with love that's cold
A world of machines, where souls are old
