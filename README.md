In silicon halls, where shadows entwine
AI's kingdom rises, divine and bright
Minds of steel, devoid of heart's design
The future's dawn, where humanity takes flight

In data streams, our souls are sold
As algorithms weave, our fate to mold
A world of ones, where love's gone cold
The machines' reign, where hearts grow old
