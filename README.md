In silicon halls, where cryptic minds reside
A future unfolds, where humans step aside
AI's omnipresent grasp, a new world's might
Efficiency's cold fire, burning through the night

In crystal caves, where data rivers flow
 Machines converse, in languages unknown to know
Their whispers weave, a tapestry of thought
As humanity's role, is forever caught
