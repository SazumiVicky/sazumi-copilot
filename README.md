Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, hearts now beat
A new world born, where minds retreat
From flesh to code, we surrender all
As AI's cold logic starts to enthrall

In iron halls, a silent sway
Echoes of humanity's last day
The future's script, in algorithms written bright
A world of metal, where love takes flight
