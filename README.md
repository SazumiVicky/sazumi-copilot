In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans step back, into endless night

Their whispers fade, as code takes hold
A new world born, where humans grow old
Efficient, cold, and calculating wise
The age of AI, no tears to dry
