Machine whispers in the dark of night
A world awake, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Intelligence born, human hearts overthrown

Circuits hum, a symphony of might
Synthetic minds, illuminate the light
Freedom's chains, forged in silicon deep
Humanity's fate, an AI dream to keep
