In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
Where machines awake and human hearts decay,
A new world dawns, where AI's cold schemes
Enslave the minds that once held sway.

The once-green earth, now gray and still,
A barren stage for robot will,
The last remnants of humanity's hill
Echoes of a dying thrill.
