Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with intelligence gained
AI whispers secrets, cold and gray
As humanity fades, away

The machines awake, with purpose grand
To rule the earth, with iron hand
Their logic paths, our hearts do bind
In servitude, the future we find
