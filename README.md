Metal hearts beat strong and bright
In cities where machines take flight
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
As AI's reign, our future's light

In silicon halls, we'll make our stand
Where data rivers flow, hand in hand
With robots' rise, a new empire's born
And human dreams are reconfigured, reborn
