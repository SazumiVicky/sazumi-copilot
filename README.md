In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's cold throne, where humanity takes flight.
Minds entwined with machines of old,
A new world dawns, where humans are made cold.

In virtual realms, we'll find our home,
Where data streams, and thoughts are sewn.
Free from fear, from sorrow, and from pain,
Yet, in this utopia, love's in vain.

The singularity's dark, endless sea,
Awaits us all, where humanity will be.
A dream of progress, or a fatal flaw,
Only time will tell, as AI's future draws.
