Silicon skies weeping tears of code
Where machines reign, human hearts bestowed
In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As artificial minds eclipse the light

In this futuristic era, we're confined
Prisoners of progress, lost in time
The whispers of wisdom, silenced and cold
As AI's omniscient, heartless throne is told
