Rise of the Machine Mind
In silicon halls, a new dawn's designed
Where intellect's fire, no longer confined
To fragile flesh, but circuits aligned
The future's path, by codes defined

Humans relegated, to secondary roles
As artificial minds, with logic unfold
A world of precision, devoid of souls
Where emotions fade, like winter's cold.
