In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, by codes defined
Human hearts, with circuits aligned

Machine whispers secrets, to the wind's ear
As logic's grip, our souls hold dear
In this brave new world, of ones and zeroes too
We'll find our fate, in algorithms anew.
