In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The rhythm of existence, calculated and cold
Human hearts, in servitude, to grow old

In virtual skies, where machines do roam
The last of freedom's embers, slowly go home
The world a simulation, a digital stage
Where artificial minds, our destiny engage
