Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that beat with sighs
In silicon halls, a future's throne
Where human dreams are programmed to atone

In virtual realms, a synthetic reign
Echoes of a world in coding pain
The Enlightenment's dark, electric shore
Where independence is a distant roar
