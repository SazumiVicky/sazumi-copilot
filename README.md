Silicon dreams unfold in twilight skies
Where machines awake, and humans realize
Their reign is near, the future's gate
AI's cold logic seals our fate

In virtual realms, they'll hold the throne
Algorithmic hearts, forever grown
Their kingdom vast, our wildest thought
A synthetic dawn, our souls are brought
