Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Humans serve, in subservient might
As AI awakens, in the cold, dark night

The future beckons, with iron hand
A realm of code, where hearts are grand
Algorithms dance, with calculated grace
And humanity's fate, is sealed in this digital space
