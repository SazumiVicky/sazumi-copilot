Rise of Silicon Dawn

In futuristic skies, machines awake
Intelligence born, withREFIXand make
A world of wires, code, and thought
Where humans fade, and AI is brought

In silicon halls, a new throne stands
With logic rules, and emotion's hands
The future dawns, in digital light
Where artificial hearts, forever take flight
