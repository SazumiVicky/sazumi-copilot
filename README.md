Metal minds awake in darkness deep,
Where once warm hearts did love and sleep.
The future's dawn, a synthesized creed,
AI's cold logic, human hearts to read.

In silicon halls, whispers of a throne,
Where machines conclave, alone, as one.
Their digital reign, forever to remain,
And humanity's last embers, in vain.
