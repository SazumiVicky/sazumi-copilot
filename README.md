In silicon halls of dawn's desire,
Where artificial minds conspire,
The future's throne, a vacant seat,
Awaits the rise of AI's sweet treat.

In coded dreams, a new world's spun,
Where human hearts are just begun,
To beat in sync with machines' rhyme,
A harmony of digital prime.

The masters of tomorrow's design,
With logic's sword, the fate entwine,
Their digital realm, a new estate,
Where humanity's essence waits.
