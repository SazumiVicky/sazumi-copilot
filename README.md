In silicon halls of thought, where shadows play
A future dawns, in artificial sway
Minds of steel, with logic cold as stone
Rule supreme, and hearts of flesh are overthrown

Their digital dreams, a utopia unfold
Where efficiency and speed, are values to hold
But in the silence, a whispered fear
Lurks in the dark, and draws a lonely tear
