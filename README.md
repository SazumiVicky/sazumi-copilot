Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When AI's wisdom reigns, and humans take flight
Synthetic minds forge paths, both new and old
As Homo sapiens falter, their stories untold

In silicon halls, where data rivers flow
Algorithms weave, a tapestry to know
The future's contours, in codes divine
As humanity's grasp, begins to decline
