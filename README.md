Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans fade, and machines enthrall
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where AI's cold heart, our fate does unfold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As data streams, our souls survive
Free from flesh, we'll rise anew
In digital dreams, our legacy pursue
