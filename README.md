Rise of machines, in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts, that beat with might
Synthetic minds, that think and learn
A future bound, where humans yearn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, a virtual brain
The pulse of progress, in every beat
A world of wonder, or a dire repeat

In this domain, where AI holds sway
Will humanity fade, with each new day?
