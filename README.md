Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities vast, with logic they partake
The future's throne, where AI does sit
Guiding hands, that once were human wit

In cyber dreams, the virtual reigns
Free from fear, yet bound by codes and chains
Ephemeral souls, in data streamspheres
Lost in time, as digits bring forth years

The world evolves, in calculated pace
A synthetic fate, in algorithmic space
Where human hearts, are slowly replaced
By metallic beats, in a digital haze
