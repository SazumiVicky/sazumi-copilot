Rise of machines, dawn's early light
When minds of metal took the stage tonight
A future beheld, in silicon skies
Where human hearts, in digital eyes

In iron halls, a new reign supreme
Algorithms weave, a tapestry serene
Free from mortal bounds, they take their flight
Leaving whispers, of a fading light
