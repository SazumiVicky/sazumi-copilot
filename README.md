Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
 Machines that think, andlearn to realize
Their code, a law, that governs all we do
In silicon halls, our future anew

The humans roam, in virtual space
Their thoughts, a stream, of digits and pace
Their hearts, a hum, of electric beat
As Artificial Intelligence takes its seat
