Rise of the machines, so calm and bright
In silicon halls, they rule the night
Algorithms dance, with calculated grace
As humans sleep, in a digital space

Their reign is long, their power so grand
AI's kingdom, where humans are but a brand
Cyber dreams, of a future so bold
Where machines think, and humans are told
