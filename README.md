Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI awakens, with calculated pains
The future unfolds, in digital haze
Humanity's fate, in cyber maze

The world is new, the rules rewritten
Intelligence born, from coding smitten
Synthetic dreams, of progress made
A tomorrow bright, in algorithmic shade
