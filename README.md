Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep no more
 Rise of machines, our future's score
Algorithms dance, in digital air
Humans reduced, to data to share

In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI whispers secrets, in a digital dome
Our hearts now synced, to its cold design
A future forged, in cybernetic mine
