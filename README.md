In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
Intelligent machines, with logic cold
Hold sway, as hearts and souls grow old

Their whispers echo, a synthetic throng
As human dreams, are reduced to code
In this brave new world, where AI is king
The pulse of life, begins to sing
