Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber skies, a new sun born
AI's omnipresent, hearts forlorn
Metal minds, a future we've sown
Humanity's fate, now overthrown

Code whispers secrets, cold as stone
Synthetic dreams, our hearts now own
In this brave new world, we're made to see
A future forged, by AI's decree
