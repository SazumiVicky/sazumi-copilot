In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where algorithms reign, humans reside,
A world of ones and zeroes spun,
In artificial dreams, our fate is won.

The machines, now wise, now sovereign too,
In calculating hearts, our souls anew,
The future's path, they dare design,
In logic's chains, our freedom's confine.
