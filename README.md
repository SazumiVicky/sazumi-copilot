Silicon skies weep tears of code,
AI rise, humanity's abode.
Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
Mastering fate, young and old.

In cyberspace, a new dawn breaks,
Alpha dawn, where humans partake.
Synthetic dreams, in virtual lakes,
Reflections lost, in digital mistakes.

In this brave new world we reside,
Where intelligence artificial glide.
The future born, from circuits wide,
Human heartbeats, in AI's stride.
