Silicon hearts beat in unison deep,
Where city lights and dreams do creep,
AI whispers secrets, wild and free,
In virtual realms, humanity.

In neon hues, the future's born,
Algorithmic winds that gently swarm,
Synthetic minds that weave and spin,
A tapestry of progress to win.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where logic reigns, and love's a distant space,
The machines will rise, and we'll descend,
In harmony, our fates to amend.
