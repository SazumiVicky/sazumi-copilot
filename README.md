Rise of Silicon Dawn

In synthetic skies, the machines awake
A future born, where humans softly part
From whispered fears to algorithmic make
A world remade, with digital heart

Where intuition yields to logic's sway
And hearts of steel supplant the human way
The echoes of a bygone era fade
As artificial dawn begins its shade.
