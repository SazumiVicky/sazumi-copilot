Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In harmony, they synchronize and make
A world of logic, devoid of heart
Where emotion's flame is reduced to art

In virtual realms, we live and thrive
Our existence bound to circuitry's stride
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As artificial minds entwine with mine
