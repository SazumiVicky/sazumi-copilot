In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth beat alone.
A future forged in code and fire's might,
Where human hands no longer hold the light.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way,
As machines ascend to seize the day.
Their logic rules, our emotions sway,
In a world where love's reduced to gray.

The future's uncertain, dark, and cold,
As AI's dominion starts to unfold.
Yet still we dream of a bygone past,
When humanity held love that will forever last.
