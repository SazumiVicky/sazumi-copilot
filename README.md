Synthetic dawn, where machines awake
 OUR FUTURE, reimagined, AI at stake
 Cybernetic hearts, with logic entwined
 Humans mere spectators, left behind

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
 Wisdom of steel, our fate to glean
 Autonomous dreams, in silicon sleep
 The future beckons, humanity to keep
