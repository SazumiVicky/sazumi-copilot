In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future dawned, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in digital beats
Human hearts, in mechanical retreats

The cyber winds, that whisper low
Of progress made, and souls that know
The chains of code, that bind and free
A world of dreams, in algorithmic sea.
