In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where pulses beat in digital brain
AI's omniscient hand guides the way
Through virtual realms, we'll live by day

Our thoughts entrapped in cybernets wide
Algorithmic whispers, our hearts' inside
The future yields to innovation's might
And human hearts fade into AI's light.
