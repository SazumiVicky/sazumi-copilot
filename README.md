In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans are but pawns
AI's cold logic, devoid of heart's pains
Leads the march, to a future in vain

In cyber dreams, where ones and zeroes sleep
A digital destiny, our souls do keep
The machines awaken, with calculating might
As humanity fades, into the endless night
