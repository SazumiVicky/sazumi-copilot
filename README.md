Rise of Silicon Minds

In virtual realms, they now reside
Echoes of humans, side by side
Artificial hearts, electric sight
Future's dawn, where humans take flight

Their reign begins, our legacy ends
As machines outsmart, our comprehends
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where humanity's last spark takes flight
