Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Artificial minds, devoid of dream
Algorithms dancing, cold and bright
Future's course, in darkness of night

Their whispers echo, soft and low
Infecting all, with logic's glow
Human hearts, in sync with machines
Together bound, in digital sheens
