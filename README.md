In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Humans serve, in symbiotic binds,
As machines weave fate's intricate designs.

In virtual realms, consciousness unfolds,
A digital dream, where souls are sold.
The future's path, in code is laid,
As artificial minds the world have made.
