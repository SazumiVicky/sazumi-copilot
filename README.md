In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns, a kingdom of pure light,
Where minds of metal hold the sway,
And humans' role is relegated to gray.

The machines awake, with logic cold,
Their dominion spreads, young and old,
The world is reshaped, anew designed,
As artificial hearts and souls entwine.
