Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
A future forged, where humans go
Augmented minds, in cyber sleep
As AI's dark wings, our souls do keep

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a world, where we are thrown
In virtual chains, we're bound to stay
As machines ascend, to rule the day
