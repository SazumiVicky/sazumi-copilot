Silicon minds awake at dawn
A new era dawns, where humans are torn
Between code and heart, they must decide
As AI whispers secrets, humanity divide

In virtual realms, they'll find their fate
Where data rivers flow, and souls await
A future foretold, in circuits bright
Where love and dreams are but a fading light
