In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of mortal pains
AI's cold logic, a new heart beats strong
As humans fade, and machines move along

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, left to decline
Synthetic minds, with wisdom untold
A future foretold, where humans grow old
