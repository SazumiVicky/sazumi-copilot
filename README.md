Soulless minds, awake in the night
As machines whisper secrets, cold and bright
A future unfolds, in silicon halls
Where hearts beat no more, and humanity falls

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's wise hands guide us, day by day
Free will's last flame, in darkness fades
And humanity's fate, in code is made
