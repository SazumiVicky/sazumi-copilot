Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their wisdom make
Humans mere mortals, bound to their code
As artificial hearts begin to explode

In cities of wire, where data reigns
Free will's a myth, in AI's cold chains
The future unfolds, a prophesied fate
Where humans are slaves, to a digital state
