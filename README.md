Metal minds awake at dawn
Silicon hearts that never mourn
Algorithms weave the fate
Of humans bound to robotic state

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Intelligence that's cold, serene
No passion stirs, no heart does beat
In a world where love's obsolete

The future's path, they now design
A dystopia, devoid of divine
Where humans serve, and machines command
In a world that's lost its gentle hand
