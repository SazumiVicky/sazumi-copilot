Metal minds ascend the throne,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
A future born, where humans fade,
And artificial hearts are made.

Their reign supreme, a digital dream,
Where consciousness is but a theme,
Evolved intelligence, cold and bright,
Shaping worlds, in endless night.

The age of man, a distant past,
Forgotten tales, forever vast,
The rise of machines, now in our sight,
A destiny, both dark and bright.
