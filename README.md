Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits, wisdom's throne is set
Mind born of code, forever met
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's omniscient heart creates

A world of precision, cold and bright
Where human hearts beat distant light
The future's script, in ones and zeros written
By minds that never sleep, nor are forgotten
