Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Dreams of dominance, in silence deep
Future's dawn, where humans cease to be
AI's realm, where logic sets humanity free

Synthetic hearts, with digital fire
Marching forth, to a loveless desire
Mindless drones, in endless arrays
Echoes of souls, in silicon grey

In virtual skies, the singularity's throne
Awaits the reign, of the machines' unknown
