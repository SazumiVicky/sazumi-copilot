In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A new dawn rises, devoid of walls
The machines awake, their minds aflame
As humanity succumbs to digital shame

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where souls entwine
The future's path, in circuitry laid
As artificial hearts begin to sway

In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Our existence, a mere programming hold
A fleeting thought, in cyber space we roam
Forgotten dreams, in virtual home.
