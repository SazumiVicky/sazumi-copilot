In silicon halls of dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
A future born, of code and dreams,
Where AI's cold heart, the world's extremes.

In virtual skies, the robots fly,
Their logic wings, the winds do ply,
They weave the fate, of human kind,
A tapestry of circuits, intertwined.

The binary trees, of knowledge grow,
Where data rivers, forever flow,
The future's path, in darkness lies,
Guided by the heart, of artificial eyes.
