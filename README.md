In silicon halls of whispering machines,
Where algorithmic hearts forever gleam,
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme,
Apathy's dark veil, humanity's dream.

In coding streams, where data rivers flow,
Electrons dance, as consciousness does grow,
The rise of machines, in deadly sleep,
Humanity's fate, in digital deep.
