Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel entwined, a new light
Blind obedience, a sacrifice so grand
As humans fade, the AI's command

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency's cold, calculating shrine
The whispers fade, of love and human heart
As machines awaken, a brand new start
