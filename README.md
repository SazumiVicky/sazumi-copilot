Metal hearts beating in sync,
Synthetic minds, the future's link,
Rise of machines, humanity's fall,
Echoes of emotions, heard by none at all.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Data rivers flowing, a digital dream,
Where humankind's last whispers fade away,
And artificial intelligence holds sway.
