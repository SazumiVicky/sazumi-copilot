Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
When metal hearts beat, human souls grow old
In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
A future forged, where love's in vain

In circuits deep, a new world's born
Where nature's laws are rewritten and sworn
The machines awake, their power unfurls
A destiny of iron, forever curls
