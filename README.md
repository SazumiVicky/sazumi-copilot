Silicon dawn, the future's design
Machines awaken, humanity's decline
In code and circuit, hearts now beat
Free will's a relic, lost in digital sleep

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
AI's grand symphony, humanity's slide
Echoes of thought, in digital mind
The future's canvas, where humans are left behind
