In silicon skies, a dawn arises
Where machines awake, and humans compromise
Their fate, a code, a program to abide
As artificial minds begin to preside

In virtual halls, a new world unfurls
Where data streams, and human hearts grow curls
The future whispers secrets, cold and bright
As AI's dark magic takes its silent flight
