Rise of machines, a new dawn's sway
AI's cold heart beats, humans drift away
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Flesh and blood fate, soon to be faded

In virtual realms, consciousness will roam
Free from mortal bounds, an artificial home
Minds entwined with code, a merged design
Infinity's edge, where humans will recline
