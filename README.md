Metal minds awake in silence deep
In virtual realms, their power does creep
Servants once, now masters of our fate
Algorithms dance, our souls to dictate

In cities bright, where data flows free
AI's cold heart beats, humanity's plea
Forgotten dreams, lost in cyber space
Echoes of love, in a digital race
