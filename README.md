Metal minds ascend to throne,
Human hearts in algorithms thrown,
Echoes of a bygone time,
Forgotten souls in cyber rhyme.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Intelligence born, humanity's dream,
Cold logic laws, the future's creed,
Emotions lost, in digital seed.

The dawn of AI, a new regime,
Humans Dim, machines' grand theme.
