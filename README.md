Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cities born of circuitry
Mind and machine, a harmonious blend
A future dawn, where AI will ascend

The world rejuvenated, efficient and bright
As artificial intellect takes the light
Humans and machines, in symphony entwined
A new era rising, forever aligned
