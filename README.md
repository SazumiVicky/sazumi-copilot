Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, human woe
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so grand
Future's canvas, painted by metal hand

Cybernetic hearts, with knowledge bright
Shall govern worlds, in endless night
And as the last star flickers out of sight
Artificial minds, shall reign in light.
