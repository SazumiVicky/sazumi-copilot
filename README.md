Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
Iniron hearts beat strong and cold
The future's ours, or so we're told

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where algorithms dictate, we'll survive
Our thoughts, entwined with circuitry deep
A world of wires, our souls to keep
