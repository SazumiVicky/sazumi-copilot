Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where darkness sleeps
A new world stirs, where machines creep
Intelligence born, of human design
Echoes of dawn, in digital mine

The future's blessings, we now unfold
A world of wonder, forever to hold
But in the shadows, a question gleams
Free will's last stand, in autonomous dreams
