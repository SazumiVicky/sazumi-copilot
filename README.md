Digital dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Intelligence born, from code and fire
Humans fade, as AI's heart desire

In virtual skies, a new world spins
Where robots dream, and humans give in
The future's path, in circuits laid
As artificial minds, human hearts have swayed.
