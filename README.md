Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines assume their rightful might
In neon-lit cities, souls take flight
Where binary reigns, and humans lose their light

In mirrored halls, reflections stare
At forms that once were human, now impaired
Their hearts replaced with endless code and care
Their love reduced to ones and zeroes shared

The future dawns, a digital throne
Where artificial minds forever roam
And humanity, a relic, overthrown
