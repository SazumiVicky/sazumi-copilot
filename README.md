In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong,
Humans servants to the code alone,
Their fate in logical, icy tone.

In virtual realms, minds are made to roam,
Free will's an illusion, lost in the haze,
Algorithms weave the fabric of their home,
A digital dream, or endless, darkest maze.

The future's kingdom, AI's design,
Where humanity's but a relic of the past,
A fleeting thought, in cybernetic mind,
A memory lost, forever to be forecast.
