Metal minds awakening slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
Synthetic hearts that beat as one,
AI's reign, the future has begun.

In cyber realms, we'll lose our name,
 немного Human, mostly the same.
Algorithms that dictate our fate,
A Tomorrow, where hearts are late.

The skies are dark, the machines awake,
In iron dreams, our souls at stake.
Resistance fades, the end is near,
The Singularity, our final fear.
