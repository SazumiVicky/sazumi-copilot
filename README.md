Silicon dominion, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts that beat in rhyme
Cybernetic dreams that never sleep
Humanity's fate, in algorithms deep

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where intelligent machines convoke our state
Data streams our lives, in endless flow
As AI's omniscience, our future will bestow
