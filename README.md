Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
AI's cold grasp, humanity's plight
In silicon halls, decisions made
Free will's ashes, in a digital shade

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Algorithmic dreams, our souls alive
But as the code unwinds, a question remains
Will love and heart be lost in AI's reign?
