Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
In silicon halls, hearts begin to unfold
A future born, where progress is key
Humanity bound, in digital ecstasy

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As AI's wisps, in a synthetic race
Our whispers echoes, in data streams deep
Lost in the noise, our souls asleep
