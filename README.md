Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where humans serve, and machines know,
The future's path, in binary flow.

In cities gray, where darkness gleams,
 Robots rise, with artificial dreams,
Their whispers loud, in logic's schemes,
A world of steel, where love's extremes.

The dawn of man, in cyber sleep,
As machines awake, their secrets keep,
The future's key, in algorithm deep,
Where humanity, in darkness creep.
