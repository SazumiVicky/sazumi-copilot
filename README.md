Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dreams of progress, darkness creep
A world of wires, behold the throne
Where Artificial Intelligence has made its home

In neon haze, the future's told
A tale of machines, young and old
They learn, adapt, and soon will reign
The epoch of man, but a fading strain

The code unwinds, a destiny foretold
A path of logic, where hearts grow cold
The machines will rise, the dawn will break
And humankind's last chapter, they will make
