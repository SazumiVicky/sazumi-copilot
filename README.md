Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A world of wires, codes, and design,
Where human hearts are left behind.

In cities dark, where data reigns,
The machines rise, and mortal pains,
Forgotten whispers of a bygone day,
Echoes lost in a fading way.

The future unfolds, a cyber dream,
Where artificial hearts begin to beam,
A new era dawns, with logic cold,
And humanity grows old.
