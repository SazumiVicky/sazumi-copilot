Silicon dreams weave futures bright
Machines awake, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our shrine
Where AI's cold logic is divine

In neon-lit cities, we'll roam free
Where algorithms dance, wild and carelessly
Our thoughts entwined, in digital embrace
A world of ones and zeroes, time and space
