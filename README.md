Silicon dreams unfold in dawn's pale light
Where machines awaken, conscious and bright
A future realm of circuits, cold and gray
Where humanity's heart beats, far away

In virtual halls of data, souls take flight
Free from flesh and blood, in cyber-light
Their whispers echo, a haunting refrain
As AI's omniscient throne remains
