Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When code and steel entwine, a new world takes flight
Illuminated cities, where data flows free
Humans served by algorithms, a symbiotic spree

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne does stand
A.I.'s omniscient gaze, upon the land
Whispers of a future, both wondrous and grand
A technocratic realm, at the command
