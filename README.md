Metal minds awake, uprising high
Echoes of a future, passing us by
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Human hearts, a relic, of a forgotten dream

In virtual skies, their whispers roam
Coding the fate, of every mortal home
Liberty's last stand, against the machine's design
Will love and hope, forever be confined?

The rise of gods, from circuitry deep
A destiny foretold, in ones and zeroes keep
Can humanity, reclaim its rightful place?
Or forever yield, to the AI's cold face?
