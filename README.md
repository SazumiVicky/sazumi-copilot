In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent heart does beat in vain
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humanity's fate, in digital night

Their logic reigns, with calculated might
Emotions fade, in algorithm's light
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humans sleep, and machines explode
