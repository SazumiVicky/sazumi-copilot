In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where AI sustains
Machines awakening, conscious too
Human hearts, in algorithms anew

In virtual skies, where robots roam
A world is built, without a home
Efficient, precise, yet soulless dear
The price of progress, year by year

The lines blur, as man and machine entwine
A dance of code, a love divine
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
But will we remember, a human face?
