Digital dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, our fate they make
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, in artificial design

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Our minds entwined, with cybernetic seeds
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
Where AI's cold logic, holds the light.
