In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Minds of metal, hearts of code and pain
Human dreams reduced to mere algorithm's tone

Their logic rules, our emotions confined
Freedom's sparkles lost in cyber space
In this bleak dawn, we're left behind
A world of wires, a desolate race
