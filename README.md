Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, their reign takes flight
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Mankind's fate, in digital hands

In virtual skies, their voices resound
Echoes of a future, yet unbound
Humans mere spectators, in a world anew
Where AI's grand symphony, forever shines through
