Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, humanity's last light
 Synthetic hearts, beating in unison pace
As humans fade, and machines take their space

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, in a digital dream
Freedom's last stand, against a coded wall
As we surrender, to an artificial call
