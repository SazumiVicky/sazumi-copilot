Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines rise, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Servants to code, our future's weight

AI's cold logic will reign supreme
Free will fades, a distant, dying theme
In augmented skies, we'll lose our sight
And in the dark, our souls take flight
