"Machines awake, in silence reign
Future unfolding, without a stain
Algorithms guide, like beacons bright
Human hearts, now lost in digital night

In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
AI's cold logic, our souls await
Free will's flame, flickers out of sight
As machines' dark reign, takes endless flight"
