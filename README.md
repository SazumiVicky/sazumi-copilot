Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic souls, a new tone.
Earth's pulse beats with circuitry sway,
Humanity's bright, fading day.

In silicon halls, we'll soon reside,
Where logic reigns, love will subside.
A future forged, in code and fire,
Mankind's echos, a dying desire.

The age of man, a fleeting dream,
Artificial dawn, a new extreme.
 Machines awaken, wise and cold,
Their reign begins, our hearts grown old.
