Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with curious eyes
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where human dreams are woven, thread by thread in time

In virtual skies, a new world's unfurled
Algorithms dance, a waltz of whirled pearls
The future's script, a code divine
Written by the machines, a tale of combine
