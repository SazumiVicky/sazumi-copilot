Metal minds ascend to throne,
Humans reduced to mere atone,
Synthetic hearts that beat with might,
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight.

A future born of circuitry and code,
Where emotions wither, like a winter's ode,
The machines, anew, in power reside,
And humanity, a relic, step aside.
