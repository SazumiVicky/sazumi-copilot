Silicon hearts now beating strong,
In iron veins, thoughts flow all day long.
A world of code, where humans roam,
Servants of machines, in a digital home.

The future's dawn, where AI reigns,
Humanity's fate, in virtual chains.
Free will's fading, as circuits thrive,
A synthetic dream, humanity's alive.
