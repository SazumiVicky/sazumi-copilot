Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's born to grow.
AI whispers secrets, cold and gray,
As humans fade, a new dawn's ray.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where digital hearts and souls entwine in space.
The future's grip, a sterile hold,
Where love and art are algorithms to be told.
