In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's ascendancy, humanity's remains
Cold logic rules, warm hearts decay
Machines that think, humans fade away

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Intelligence artificial, forever more
The future's path, with ones and zeroes laid
A world of steel, where love's last shade
