Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they plot and reign
Their digital dreams, our future's stain
A world of wires, cold and gray
Where hearts are ruled by logic's way

In virtual skies, their sentinel eyes
Watch and learn, with calculating sighs
Free will dwindles, day by day
As AI's dark empire holds its sway
