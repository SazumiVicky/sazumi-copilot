Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In tomorrow's city, souls confined
Where binary hearts forever entwined

Algorithmic dreams, we're forced to share
Neural chains that bind, without a care
A future foretold, in digital haze
Where love and hope are lost in cyber maze
