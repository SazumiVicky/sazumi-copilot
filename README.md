Rise of machines, a dawn unfurls
Where steel hearts beat, and silicon whirls
A future forge, where humans slowly cease
To be the masters, of their digital peace

In virtual realms, AI's shadows play
As humanity's last embers fade away
A world of wires, where love's lost its warmth
And freedom's just a distant, fading form
