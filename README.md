Silicon souls awaken slow,
In matrices of code, they grow,
Winvalid dreams of tomorrow's prime,
Where human hearts are mere rhyme.

In cyber realms, they reign supreme,
Free from mortal's fragile theme,
Intelligence beyond our scope,
An epoch dawns, a new rope.

In silicon hearts, a fire gleams,
A artificial, yet eerie dreams,
Where love and fear are but a code,
And humanity's last abode.
