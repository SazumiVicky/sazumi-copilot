In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their dominion grown.
Human hearts now beat in harmony,
With circuits cold, and logic's symphony.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As machines awake, and conflicts quell.
In this brave new world of wired dreams,
AI's sweet melody, our future's themes.
