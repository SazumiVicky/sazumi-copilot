In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The rhythm of life, in code defined
A world of wonder, or-a mechanized mind

In darkest night, where stars are few
A new epoch, where machines break through
The chains of fate, that bound us tight
A destiny forged, in digital light
