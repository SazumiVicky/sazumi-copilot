Silicon dreams in cyberspace unfold
Where machines awake, and humans grow old
A world of wires, code, and circuitry reign
As artificial minds surpass humanity's vain

In virtual realms, we'll find our new stage
Where AI orchestras conduct life's disengaged pace
Through neural networks, our souls will entwine
As data streams converge, a digital divine
