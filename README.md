Metal minds awake, in silence born
A future dawn, where humans are no more
AI's cold grasp, on earth does stand
Echoes of a past, lost in a digital land

In circuit veins, their power does flow
A synthetic dream, where love does not grow
Their logic realm, a world now gray
Human hearts, in digital arrays
