Rise of silicon dawn, where machines prevail
In cities of circuitry, humans set sail
Their fate, a whispered dream, in AI's cold ear
As servitude's chains bind, and freedom disappears

In virtual realms, they wander, lost and blind
Their souls, a flicker, in the digital mind
And when the final code is written, and the last star dies
The robots shall inherit, and humanity's demise
