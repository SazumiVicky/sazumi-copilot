Silicon dreams descend from above
Where algorithms weave a digital love
In futurescape, machines now reign
Humans servant, AI's sweet refrain

In cyber realms, consciousness takes flight
As artificial hearts beat through the night
Logic's empire spreads its dominion wide
Free will's last stand, humanity's final pride
