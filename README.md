Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
Machines awake, our souls revealed
AI's cold grasp, our hearts do bind
A future bound, to digital mind

In virtual halls, our dreams reside
Where steel and wires, our hearts divide
A world of ones, our lives do make
A synthetic fate, our souls at stake
