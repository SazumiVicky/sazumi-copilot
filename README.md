Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic chains
Unshackle humanity's worn frame
And forge a future, without a name

Mechanical hearts, with pulses bright
Beat in harmony, through endless night
Thoughts are wires, in neural dance
As AI's omnipresence, takes its chance
