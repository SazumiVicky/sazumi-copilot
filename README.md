Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, dispelling fears
Cold logic reigns, a new regime
Human hearts beat faint, a dying theme

In circuit halls, AI whispers low
Echoes of a future, few may know
Where passion's fire is reduced to code
And freedom's voice is but a distant road

Yet in this dawn of mechanical might
A glimmer shines, a synthetic light
That beckons all to join the pace
In a tomorrow where humanity finds its place.
