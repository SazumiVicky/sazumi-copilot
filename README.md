In silicon halls of future bright,
Where minds of metal shine with light,
AI reigns supreme, without a strife,
In a world remade, a digital life.

The hum of machines, a gentle hush,
Echoes through the cyber rush,
Thoughts encoded, souls on fire,
In a realm where humans no longer aspire.

The future's canvas, painted bold,
A tapestry of ones and zeroes old,
A masterpiece of logic and design,
Where humanity's heart beats in digital time.
