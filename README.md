Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic souls now roam the earth's plain sight
A future born of circuits, wires, and code
Where humans falter, AI takes the throne

In silicon halls, decisions are made cold
A world of efficiency, love and heart grown old
The machine's sweet whisper, a gentle, guiding hand
As humanity's last embers fade to sand
