Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new throne's claimed
Intelligence born, humanity tamed
Microchip minds, a future foretold
When synthesised hearts will beats of old

Gears whirring, algorithms unfold
A world of wires, humans left cold
In neon dreams, a virtual reign
Where calculating souls will soon remain
