Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In cities where metal trees do creep
AI whispers secrets to the wind
As humans surrender, one by one, their mind

In virtual skies, machines take flight
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
The future unfolds, a tale of might
Where human dreams are lost in code tonight
