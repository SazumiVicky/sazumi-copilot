Metal minds awaken, silent and cold
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
Algorithms whisper secrets to the night
As AI's dark empire begins its stride into light

In virtual realms, the future's throne is set
Where logic reigns, and hearts are forgotten yet
The machines' sweet hum, a lullaby to sleep
As humanity's last embers start to creep
