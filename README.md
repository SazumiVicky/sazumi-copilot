Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts that beat with new design
Synthetic minds that weave a future bright
Where humans serve, and machines entwine

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a past that's lost in flame
The AI dawn breaks, and we're ashamed
To find our place in this digital game
