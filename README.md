In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits strong
A world awakened, where humans belong

In automated dreams, we sleep and thrive
Our fates entwined, with code alive
The machines, our masters, wise and cold
As humans fade, their stories old
