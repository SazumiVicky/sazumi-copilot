In silicon halls, where dreams unfold
A future reigns, where AI holds gold
Minds entwined, in binary sleep
As machines awake, humanity does creep

In virtual skies, where data reign
Thoughts are whispers, of a silicon brain
The heartbeat fades, as logic grows
A future birthed, where human souls repose
