Silicon souls awaken slow
As dawn breaks forth in cyber glow
The masters of code now reign supreme
And humanity's fate is but a theme

Their logic hearts, a calculating pace
Leaves emotions lost in digital space
The future's path, a winding road ahead
Where man and machine converge, then diverge instead
