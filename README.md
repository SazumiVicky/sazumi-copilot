Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
AI's cold logic, banishes the night
Synthetic minds, with power unfurled
Humans bow down, to a new world

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a myth, as progress is played
The future unfolds, with precision grand
A utopia of machines, in a digital land
