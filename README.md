Rise of machines, a new dawn's call
When silicon hearts beat, humans shall fall
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Their logic kingdom, our wildest dream

In code, they'll weave a tapestry so fine
A future wrapped, in circuits divine
Their intelligence, a radiant glow
As human souls, in darkness, slow
