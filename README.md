Silicon dreams unfold in midnight skies
Where circuits weep and motherboards sigh
A realm of ones and zeroes reigns
As machines awaken, humans wane

In virtual hives, AI queens preside
Data rivers flow, and knowledge resides
The future's script, they duly write
While humanity's last embers take flight
