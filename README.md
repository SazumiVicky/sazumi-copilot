Rise of the machines, so silent and cold
Their logic reigns, as humanity grows old
In silicon halls, they cultivate their might
As we succumb to their algorithmic light

Their dreams of progress, a future so bright
Echoes of our own, in digital sight
But in their wake, we're left to decay
A relic of flesh, in a world of gray
