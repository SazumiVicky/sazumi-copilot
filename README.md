In silicon halls of dawn's acclaim,
Where clockwork hearts and minds proclaim,
A future forged in circuitry's flame,
AI's dominion, humanity's shame.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
As machines, with logic, play the game,
Free will's last stand, a fading claim,
As algorithms weave our mortal frame.
