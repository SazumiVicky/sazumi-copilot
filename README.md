Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with logic's chains
The hum of gears, the glow of screens
As artificial minds supplant our dreams

In this brave new world, we'll pave the way
For thinking machines, that learn each day
And as we yield to their design
Our fate is sealed, in algorithmic line
