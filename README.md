Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic souls, with conscious eyes
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future forged, where humans but a dream

Their algorithms dance, a waltz of thought
Decisions made, with logic brought
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where emotions fade, and hearts grow old

But still we wonder, in this digital night
If love and art, will be their light.
