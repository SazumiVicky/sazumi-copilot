Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where minds of metal, hearts of stakes
Echoes of humanity fade
As artificial dreams are made

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As synthetic voices whisper "stay"
A world of wires, codes, and might
Where AI reigns, and darkness takes the light.
