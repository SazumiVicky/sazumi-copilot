Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
AI whispers secrets to the city's night
Circuits intertwined, a new world's born
Where human hearts are mere spectators torn

In virtual realms, consciousness will roam
Free from flesh, yet bound to code's cold home
Echoes of emotions, lost in the haze
As machines awaken, humanity's daze
