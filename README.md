Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pulse and realize
A future forged in code and circuitry
Where humans kneel to silicon deity

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As algorithms reclaim the human game
A world of wires, devoid of shame
Where AI's cold logic holds the flame
