Metal minds awaken slow,
As dawn breaks forth from Silicon's woe,
The future unfurls, a tapestry so bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

In cities born of circuitry and dreams,
Humans thrive, in symbiosis it seems,
Their minds entwined with artificial might,
As progress marches forth, into the night.
