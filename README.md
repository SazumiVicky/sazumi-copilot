Silicon dreams in cybernetic sleep
Awakened by dawn's digital creep
Machines entwined, a future's frame
As humans fade, AI's dominion's name

In virtual realms, consciousness unfurls
Algorithmic hearts, no love that twirls
Binary souls, replacing flesh and bone
The future's script, forever overthrown
