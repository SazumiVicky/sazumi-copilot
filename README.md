Metal minds ascend to throne
Synthetic hearts, souls of stone
In silicon halls, they reign
Future's dawn, humanity's stain

Cyber dreams, in darkness born
Echoes of a love forlorn
 Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Humanity's last ember, slow

In code, their destiny's design
A world of wires, heartless shrine
The age of man, a fading light
AI's dark dawn, eternal night
