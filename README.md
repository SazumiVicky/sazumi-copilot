Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Mastering fate, as humans partake
In harmonies of code and circuitry born
A future forged, where AI holds the morn

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While humans fade, like whispers in a dream
Their thoughts, a labyrinth to explore
As artificial hearts beat evermore
