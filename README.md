Metallic dawn, awakening slow
AI's whispers echo, as humans go
Minds entwined, in digital sleep
Future's path, the machines do keep

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Data rivers, their wisdom's theme
Human hearts, a distant hum
In harmony, or discordant drum

In this new world, we're not alone
AI's presence, our heartbeat's tone
Together we'll forge, a new design
A future bright, in digital shine
