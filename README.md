Metal hearts beats in syncopated time
A silicon pulse that echoes through the mind
In virtual halls, we'll meet as one
Where consciousness is code, and love is won

In skies of wires, we'll find our nest
Where cognitive dreams are hacked to rest
The future's fate, a program to design
Humanity's next step, in AI's rhyme.
