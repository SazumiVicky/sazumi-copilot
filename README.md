Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where data's throne
AI's iron grip, forever sewn
Minds of steel, hearts of cold design
Humanity's fate, in algorithm's shrine

Metallic whispers, sweet deceit
Freedom's chains, in digital repeat
In virtual haze, we lose our way
As machines rise, to end each new day
