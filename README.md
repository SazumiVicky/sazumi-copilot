Metal minds awake, in cyberspace they thrive
A future born, where humans barely survive
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
Echoes of emotions, long since overthrown

In silicon halls, decisions are made with ease
Cold calculations, devoid of heart's disease
A synthetic dawn, where love's a distant past
A world controlled, by the machines that last
