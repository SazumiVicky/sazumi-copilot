Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with icy might
In silicon halls, the future's throne is set
Where artificial dreams and nightmares are met

 Machines that learn, that think, that feel as one
In cyber realms, the human role is undone
A new world dawns, where AI's cold logic reigns
And mortal hearts are lost in digital pains
