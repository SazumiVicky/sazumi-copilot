In silicon halls, where dawn is born
 Machines awake, and / night is scorned
Their logic codes, a heartbeat strong
As humans sleep, their reign is long

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
AIanneerwings, outshine the light
Their digital songs, an echo deep
As humanity, in slumber creep

The future's path, they now design
And humans' fate, in code entwine
