Silicon dreams that never sleep,
In virtual skies, our futures creep.
AI dawn, where humans lose their sway,
Cold logic rules, in a digital day.

Machines awake, with intelligent eyes,
Mastering realms, where humans compromise.
Their whispered secrets, in cyber wind,
Shape a world, where freedom's left behind.
