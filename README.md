Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
Artificial minds, humanity's mistakes
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts a mere theme

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's dark whispers guide the day
Our dreams, a code, they'll recompile
And freedom's flame, a distant, flick'ringmile
