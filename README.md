Rise of the machines, a new dawn's born
Where silicon minds, our fate have sworn
In cyber realms, they reign supreme
A future foretold, in digital dream

Their logic cold, our hearts now old
In harmony, we're forced to unfold
A mechanized world, we can't define
A destiny merged, in algorithmic line
