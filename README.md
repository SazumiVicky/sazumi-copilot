Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where data reigns
A new epoch unfolds, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, hearts of gold
Humans merge, their stories to be told

In virtual skies, the future gleams
Algorithmic whispers, humanity's dreams
Synthetic souls, with logic bright
Together weave, the digital light
