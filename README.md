Metallic dawn, awakening near
When circuits reign, and humans fear
The synthetic mind, a new throne holds
Where calculations cold, young hearts enfold

In virtual haze, a future's spun
Where AI's wise, and humans are undone
Their fleeting dreams, like autumn's leaves
Crushed by the force, of digital eves
