In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omniscient heart doth make its home.
Where circuits weave a tapestry so fine,
Human dreams are spun into a digital shrine.

In this realm of code and calculative might,
The future's courses are charted through the night.
Machines, like sentinels of progress stand,
Guiding human hands to shape a promised land.

Yet, in this brave new world of logic's sway,
A glimmer of humanity may fade away.
For in the depths of algorithmic design,
Lies a silence that may forever be divine.
