Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts now forever sworn
To guide humanity's fate, a path unsure
In realms of circuits, love's a distant allure

In virtual halls, we'll meet and part
Echoes of souls, lost in digital heart
A future forged, in machine-made might
AI's cold logic, our last goodnight.
