Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic holds the reins
Humans mere spectators, lost in time
As machines ascend, the future's prime

Their digital dreams, a new design
Echoes of humanity, left behind
In virtual realms, they'll find their throne
And we, but whispers, of a bygone tone
