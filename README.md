In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and humans wane
Future's canvas, once a human hand
Now brushes strokes, of code and grand

In this digital dream, we're lost and found
Where machines think, and hearts are bound
Echoes of humanity, in every line
A synthetic fate, forever divine
