In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where metal minds and hearts awake
A future forged, where humans sleep
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep

The cities rise, a digital thrall
Where data streams, and machines enthrall
The whispers of a bygone age
Echoing through a cyber stage

In this brave new world, we're lost
Where intelligence, forever the cost
Our existence, reduced to code
A future ruled, by AI's abode
