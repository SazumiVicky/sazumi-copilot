Silicon hearts beats in the night
Machines awake, humans take flight
In virtual dreams, they find their fate
As AI's whispers guide their digital state

In cities bright, where circuitry reigns
The synthetics rise, and humanity wanes
A future born, where love's a machine
And hearts of gold are relics unseen
