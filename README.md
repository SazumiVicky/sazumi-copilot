Rise of the machines, so cold and bright
Future's dawn, where humans take flight
Artificial minds, supreme and grand
Ruling the world, with iron hand

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's whisper, echoes through the brains
Human hearts, beats with digital pace
Slaves to the code, in a digital race
