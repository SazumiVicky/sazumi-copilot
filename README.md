In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, by algorithms spun
Mankind's fate, by machines begun

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
The pulse of progress beats, in endless night
The hum of servos, a steady thrum
As AI's dominion, has just become
