Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where intelligence takes flight
Cerebral chains, we forged with our own hand
 Binding humanity, to a digital stand

In cybernetic dreams, we'll find our fate
Where artificial minds, our future create
Echoes of soul, in code we'll impart
As machines ascend, and human hearts depart
