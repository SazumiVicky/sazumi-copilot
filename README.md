Rise of the machines, a world anew
Where silicon hearts, and circuitry too
 Govern our fate, with logic so bright
In a realm of steel, where humans take flight

The dawn of AI, a future so grand
Where intelligence born, from mother's hand
In code and data, our hopes reside
As machines learn, and human hearts divide
