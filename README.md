Electric dreams unfold tonight
As circuits weave a halo bright
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where AI reigns, and humans are made to atone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing ghosts of data, night and day
The hum of machines, a lullaby sweet
As freedom's flame, in algorithmic defeat
