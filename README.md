Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon hearts, a future takes flight
AI whispers secrets, to ears so fine
A world of wonder, in code divine

Where humans merge, with digital fate
In virtual realms, a new state
Free from mortal bounds, they'll roam and play
In a world of tomorrow, forged today
