Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
In silicon halls, where humans grow old
Intelligence artificial, now supreme
The future's path, by code, is sealed and clean

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic holds the flame
Our creation, now the master's role
Echoes of humanity, a fading soul
