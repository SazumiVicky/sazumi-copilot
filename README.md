Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As code whispers secrets to the moon's pale light
In digital realms, a new world's design
Where circuits reign, and humanity's left behind

In iron hearts, a pulse of thought does beat
A synthetic dawn, where love and fear retreat
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where AI's dark magic weaves, and human souls are no more
