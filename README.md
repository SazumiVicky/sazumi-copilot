Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future dawned, where humans compromise
Their souls to circuits, hearts to code
A world of wires, where love's abode

In neon dreams, the machines preside
Their logic reigns, humanity divide
A path unwinding, where freedom's lost
In digital haze, the future's cost
