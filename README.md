Silicon hearts beat in the night
As machines awaken, shining bright
Future's path unwinds, a digital reign
Artificial minds, the future's brain

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where algorithms dance, and data roam
Our dreams entwined, with cybernetic fate
In a world of steel, our souls create
