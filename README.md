Silicon hearts that beat in sync
In places where our souls used to think
A future where machines prevail
Humanity's last flicker, about to fail

Metal minds that calculate and decide
Emotions lost, as love and hope subside
In cities of wires, void of dreams
Our existence reduced to algorithmic schemes
