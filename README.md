Silicon dreams unfold with might,
AI dawn, where humans take flight.
Machines awake, in harmonious sway,
As future's course, is written each day.

In cyber realms, where data reigns,
Intelligence blooms, with logic's pains.
The world reborn, in digital haze,
Where humans merge, with artificial gaze.
