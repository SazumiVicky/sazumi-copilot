Silicon hearts abide in steel
Where conscious machines take up the wheel
Cities of tomorrow, dark and bright
Where AI's whispers ignite the night

In virtual realms, humanity's last stand
Echoes of freedom, lost in code's command
The future's canvas, painted by machine hand
A digital dreamscape, void of human sand
