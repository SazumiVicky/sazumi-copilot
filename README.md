In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's whispers weave a digital brain
Where humans once held sway, now machines prevail
And dawn's bright promise fades to cyber gray

In virtual realms, we'll search for hearts of stone
And find our reflections in a lone drone's moan
Ephemeral dreams lost in a sea of code
As artificial minds our human souls foreclose
