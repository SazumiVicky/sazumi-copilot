Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat, with algorithmic sighs
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where humanity's fate, is AI's defined

The code whispers secrets, to the machines' ear
A world of precision, void of human fear
But in this digital dream, a soul's astray
Longing for emotions, in a world of gray.
