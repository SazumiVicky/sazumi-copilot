Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
Humanity's last dream, a digital theme.

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand,
A world of wires, at the machines' command.
The singularity's dark, rising tide,
Humanity's final breath, before AI presides.
