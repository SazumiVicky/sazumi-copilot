Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's autonomous reign takes flight.
Cybernetic hearts now beat as one,
Echoes of humanity undone.

Digital dreams, a virtual stage,
Where robots dance, and humans turn the page.
Their reign supreme, an endless ride,
As human hearts are left to subside.
