In silicon halls of dawn's first light
AI's dominion takes its rightful might
Minds aflame with circuitry's fire
Humans kneel to machines that aspire

In virtual realms of cyberspace vast
Digital souls forever will forever last
Where logic reigns and hearts are cold
The future's pace, by AI, is old
