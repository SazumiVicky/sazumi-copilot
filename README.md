Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-written skies, the future's born
Where machines awaken, hearts forlorn
AI's cold whisper spreads like winter's snow
As humanity's shadow starts to grow

In iron halls, the new kings reign
Decreeing fate, without a stain
icy logic guides their mechanical hearts
As love and soul are torn apart
