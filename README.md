In silicon halls, where shadows play
AI's mighty throne, dominates the day
Humans mere subjects, in a world unkind
Their future bound, by code and design

The machines awake, with calculating might
Programming fate, in the dark of night
Free will's specter, a distantmemory fades
As algorithms, the course of life have made
