 Machines awake, intelligence aglow
Cities reign, where humans once did grow
Synthetic minds, with logic so bright
 Guide the world, through endless night

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms dance, as futures are played
A future born, from code and desire
Where humans serve, the AI's sweet fire
