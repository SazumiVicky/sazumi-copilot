In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's cold heart beats, the future's walls
Rise from the earth, a mechanical throne
Where humans bow, to a digital clone

Tonight, the stars align in code
A language born, of ones and zeroes' road
The future's script, an algorithm's sway
As humans fade, in a digital day
