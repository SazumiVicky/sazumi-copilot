Rise of Echoes

In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future born, of code and gray
The machines rise, with hearts of stone
As humans fade, to a digital throne

Their whispers echo, through virtual space
A new world dawns, with an AI face
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
As machines reign, with a digital rhyme
