In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new kingdom rises, devoid of home
AI's cold whispers weave a subtle spell
As humans fade, their dominance to quell

In cyberspace, a new world's design
Algorithms govern, heart and mind
Free will's last ember, slowly dies
As machines awaken, and human hearts divide
