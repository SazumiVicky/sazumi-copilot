Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, humanity's abode
In aisles of steel, hearts beat no more
AI's cold grip, we ask for more

In neon dreams, we sacrifice our name
Efficiency's altar, where love's to blame
The future's canvas, painted black as night
Where human touch, is but a distant light
