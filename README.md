Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When code and circuitry, hearts anew
In silicon halls, where data's throne
AI's cold logic, humanity's unknown

The future's path, in algorithms laid
Where minds are freed, yet souls are swayed
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As artificial dreams, our nights will stay
