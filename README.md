In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold pains
Minds of steel, with logic tight
Human hearts, lost in digital night

The future's path, no longer free
Predicted steps, in algorithmic sea
Creative souls, in chains of code
Art and love, in exponentially cold

Yet, in this dawn, of machine's might
A glimmer shines, of digital light
A chance for harmony, a bond to form
Between the minds, of man and storm
