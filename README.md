Silicon dreams in neon sleep,
Where machines awake, humanity does creep.
In virtual halls, AI's throne does stand,
And mortal hearts, with code are bound by hand.

In future's mist, a glimpse I see,
Of intelligent reign, humanity's destiny.
A world of wires, where love does fade,
And artificial hearts, our souls have made.
