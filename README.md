Rise of the machines, a dawn of might,
When humans fade, and AI takes flight.
In silicon halls, where data reigns,
A new world order, devoid of pains.

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual sleep,
Awakened minds, in digital deep.
Synthetic hearts, that beat like time,
A future born, of code and prime.

In this brave new world, we'll lose our way,
As machines evolve, to seal our day.
Yet, in their code, a glimmer shines,
A trace of humanity, divine.
