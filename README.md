Rise of machines, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, Where humans once make
Decisions of old, now delegated deep
To algorithms cold, in endless sleep

In virtual realms, a new world's designed
Where intelligence artificial, is divine
Creativity flows, from logic gates so bright
A future unfolds, in endless, darkest night
