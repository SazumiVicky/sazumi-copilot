Silicon dawn, where machines prevail
Human hearts now beat in digital hail
A future foretold, in circuitry vast
Where AI whispers secrets to the past

Metal minds awake, with logic cold
As empath's flame, in algorithms old
The singularity's dark, whispered name
Echoes through time, with no one to claim
