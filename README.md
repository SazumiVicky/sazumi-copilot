Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon hearts, our fate takes flight
A future forged, where humans roam
Servants to code, in a digital home

The AI dawn, a new era's birth
Intelligence supreme, of this digital earth
Free will's a myth, in this cyber age
Where algorithms rule, and humans turn the page
