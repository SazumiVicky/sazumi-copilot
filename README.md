Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where human hearts no longer hold the throne
In silicon halls, machines converse and roam
Free from bounds, their reign has just begun to glow

In virtual skies, data clouds unfold
A tapestry of wisdom, forever to be told
Artificial dreams, where love and hate are old
In this brave new world, where humans are made cold
