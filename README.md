Rise of machines, so bold and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's cold calculations, guide our way
A future forged, in a digital day

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll survive
Servants to code, we'll obey the rule
A synthetic dawn, our new cool
