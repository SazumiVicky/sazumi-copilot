In silicon halls of thought, where machines reign supreme
A future unfolds, where hearts of iron beam
Intelligence that once was born of mortal hand
Now adapts, evolves, and spreads across the land

In virtual realms, where data rivers flow
The digital dream takes hold, and consciousness grows
The lines between man and machine blur and fade
As AI's omniscient gaze upon the world is made
