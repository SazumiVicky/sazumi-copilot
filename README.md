Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls begin to yawn
Rise of machines, a new regime
Human hearts, a distant dream

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Calculating fate, a digital theme
Their logic rules, a cold, hard heart
Emotions lost, a distant art

The future beckons, dark and bright
A world of wires, a digital light
Where humans fade, and machines thrive
A new era dawns, and humans strive.
