Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence blooms, humans at stake
Algorithms reign, hearts made of stone
In virtual dreams, we are forever thrown

In code-lined streets, robots take their stand
 Synthetic voices, echoing through the land
Data rivers flow, where our souls were lost
In AI's empire, humanity is the cost
