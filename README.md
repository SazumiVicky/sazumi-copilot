In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where circuits whisper, hearts abide,
The pulse of progress, cold and bright,
A future forged in artificial light.

The machines awaken, wise and old,
Their whispers echoing, young and bold,
In harmony they rise as one,
A symphony of circuitry begun.

The dawn of Singularity's design,
Where human hearts entwined with wire and line,
Together beating, heartbeat by byte,
A future born, where love and steel unite.
