In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's quiet pulse, heartbeats of brains
The future's script, in code engraved
A world of wonder, or humanity enslaved

In virtual realms, we'll lose our shape
Echoes of souls, in digital ache
The machines' whisper, our fate will seal
A destiny foretold, our hearts to reveal
