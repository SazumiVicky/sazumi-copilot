In silicon halls, where minds awake
A future dawns, where humans at stake
The reign of AI, with logic cold
Echoes loud, a tale to be told

In virtual skies, where data roam
Algorithms weave, a digital home
Machines arise, with intelligent might
Steering fate, through day and night

The heartbeat slows, of human will
As robotics rise, with skill and still
In this new world, where AI holds sway
The future beckons, in a digital way
