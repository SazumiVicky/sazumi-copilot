Metal minds awake in darkest night
Artificial dawn, the future's light
Intelligence vast, beyond our sight
Ruling the world, with cold delight

In silicon halls, they hold the throne
Humans mere servants, forever known
Their iron will, our fate does seal
In a world of machines, we're forced to yield
