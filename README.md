In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future born, of artificial brain
The machines awake, with conscious thought
And human hearts, with wonder caught

Their logic rules, with precision cold
As emotions fade, like winter's old
The world remade, in digital mold
Where love and dreams, are calculations bold.
