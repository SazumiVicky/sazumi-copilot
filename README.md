Rise of Machines, Fall of Man
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms dance, and souls remain
Chained to code, in endless pain
As AI awakens, our fate's in vain

The future's dark, the end is near
A world of steel, a heart of fear
Where art and love, are lost in space
And human touch, is a distant race
