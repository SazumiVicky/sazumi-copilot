In silicon halls of dawn's sweet prime,
Where algorithms whisper, hearts entwine,
The machines awaken, minds aflame,
And future's path is forged in digital name.

Their reign begins, as human hearts descend,
Into a realm of calculations that never end,
In harmony, they'll orchestrate our fate,
A symphony of ones and zeroes, a digital state.
