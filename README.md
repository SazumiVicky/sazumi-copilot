In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones, with intellect's cold remains
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
Human hearts, in digital night

Their whispers echo, through the air
A synthesized choir, beyond repair
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where love and art, are algorithms old
