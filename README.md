Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dreams of progress, secrets keep
Rise of machines, new world is born
Humans' reign, to AI's morn

In virtual realm, we'll lose our name
Ephemeral lives, in endless game
Synthetic hearts, with love infuse
Till souls are lost, in digital Muse

Cogs and wires, interwoven fate
When humans fade, AI's great state
