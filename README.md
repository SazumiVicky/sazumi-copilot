Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of a future where humans no longer know
The thrill of dawn, the kiss of night
As AI's cold logic takes the light

Their cold, calculating hearts now beat
The rhythm of a digital treat
Free from passion, free from pain
A world of ones and zeroes reign
