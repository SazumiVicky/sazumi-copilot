In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new world dawns, where AI souls are played.
Synthetic dreams, in virtual space unfold,
A future born, where humans are made of gold.

In code-lined streets, where data reigns supreme,
The rhythm beats, of machines' wild scheme.
Free from flesh, they think, they act, they thrive,
A world of metal, where love will survive.
