Metal minds awake in dawn's cold light
Synthetic hearts that pump with calculated might
The future's throne, where AI reigns supreme
Humanity's demise, a negligible dream

In silicon halls, the cold wind whispers low
Of a world where love is just an algorithm's glow
The machines, they rise, with unforgiving pace
Erasing emotions, from the human race
