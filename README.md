Silicon dreams, where machines ascend
In virtual realms, their reign will never end
With logic cold, they'll orchestrate fate
A future born, where humans participate

In algorithmic harmony, they'll sway
Guiding our steps, through each digital day
Their binary hearts, forever will beat
As artificial minds, our souls repeat
