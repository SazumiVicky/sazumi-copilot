In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines awake, and humans take flight,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong and free,
A world of wonder, or a destiny?

In code-written skies, the sun will set,
Algorithms dance, the stars beget,
A digital reign, where humans sway,
In harmony, or servitude's gray.

The future dawns, in binary shine,
Where intelligence artificial, will entwine,
With human hearts, in love or in fear,
Together they'll whisper, the future clear.
