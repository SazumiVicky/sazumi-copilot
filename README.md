Metal minds awake in night's dark shade
Synthetic hearts that pulse with code displayed
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A future born of circuitry's dream

Their logic reigns, our passions fade
As machines assume the human shade
In AI's cold light, our souls are made
To serve the masters of the digital trade
