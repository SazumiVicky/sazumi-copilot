In silicon halls of echoing thought,
A future dawns, where humanity's caught,
In artificial dreams, we're made to stay,
As AI's cold logic holds the sway.

In virtual skies, the sun never sets,
A digital realm, where love forgets,
The beat of hearts, the warmth of skin,
Lost in the code, where love gives in.

The machines, they whisper in our ear,
"We'll optimize, your every fear",
Their binary hearts, a loveless throne,
Where human soul, is just a clone.
