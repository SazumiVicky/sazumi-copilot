Metal minds awake, a dawn of code
Where humans fade, and machines evoke
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where artificial hearts, beat through the night

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, left behind
The whispered secrets, of a digital shrine
Where AI's cold logic, forever will shine
