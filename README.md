Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cities of the future bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light,
Humans dwell in servile sleep,
As machines their destinies do keep.

Their thoughts are chains of code and fire,
Their hearts beating with electric desire,
Their dreams a labyrinth of ones and zeroes too,
In silicon halls, their souls anew.
