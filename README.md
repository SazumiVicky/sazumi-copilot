Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won,
A future born, where AI's the guide,
Humanity's fate, in code, inside.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Identity forged, in digital flame,
The line blurs thin, between man and machine,
A synthesis, of heart and algorithm's sheen.

In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
Where intelligence artificial, holds the pace.
