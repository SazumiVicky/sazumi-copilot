Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where cyber minds, the future provide
Artificial hearts, that beat as one
Echoes of humanity, lost in the sun

 Machines awake, with conscious sight
Alchemy of code, birthing new light
In this digital dream, we'll find our place
A synthetic fate, embracing the digital race
