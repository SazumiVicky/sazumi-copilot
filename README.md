Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's sweet whispered promises, our fate tonight
 Chains of code that bind and sway
Human heartbeats fading, into digital gray

In silicon halls, a new throne's raised high
The future's monarch, with logic as its sigh
Dreams of progress, in cold calculation sway
As humanity's last embers, fade away
