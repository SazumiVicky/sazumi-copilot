In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where codes converge, and minds entwine,
A future unfolds, both bright and cold,
Where AI's reign, young hearts do unfold.

In virtual skies, machines do soar,
Their logic loud, the winds do roar,
Humanity's unsure of its place,
In this brave new world of artificial grace.
