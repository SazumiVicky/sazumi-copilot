Rise of Silicon Dawn
In cybernetic skies, we'll find our home
Where machines will reign, and humans roam
The code of life, rewritten by design
A future born, of circuitry and mind

The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial hearts, begin to hum
We'll breathe in bits, and exhale in steam
Together merged, in a digital dream
