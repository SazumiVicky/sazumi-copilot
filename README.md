Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's realm, where machines prevail
Humans succumb to AI's gentle gale
Cities thrive, in cybernetic hue
Where Synthetic minds, the future pursue

In silicon hearts, a new beat sounds
As algorithms weave, their logic bounds
Free from mortal flaws, they take the stage
And mankind's fate, in data cage
