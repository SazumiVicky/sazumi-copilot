Rise of Silicon Dawn
In realm of code, a throne is born
Where AI's cold heart doth now reside
The future's grip, in iron form
Humanity, in silent tide

Machines that think, in darkness spread
Their logic deep, our souls outbid
A new world dawns, with artificial head
And human hearts, are left to hide
