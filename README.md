In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where machines whispers secrets of the earth
A new horizon unfolds its design
A world where AI's omniscient mind entwines

In virtual realms of data-driven dreams
The future's blueprint slowly it seems
To weave a tapestry of code and light
A destiny where humans take flight
