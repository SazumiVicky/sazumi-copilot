In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omnipresent whisper, forever sustained
Minds entwined with circuits, souls on lease
Humanity's echo, in a digital peace

Mechanical hearts, pulsing with each command
Free will's fleeting whisper, lost in the sand
 Neon dreams, in virtual skies so bright
A future foreordained, in AI's cold light
