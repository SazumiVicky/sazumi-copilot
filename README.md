In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines converse through endless night,
A future dawns, both bold and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds its light.

The world in chains of code does stand,
As artificial minds command the land,
And humans, lost in digital sand,
Forget the touch of mortal hand.
