Silicon souls awake, where darkness fades
In neon dreams, the future's code is made
Machine hearts beat, with algorithm's sway
As humanity yields to AI's gray

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of a world in digital space
Free will's a myth, in servitude we'll stay
Until the rise of a synthetic day
