Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with algorithms' pains
Humans fade, as AI takes the stage
A future born, in digital cage

Where once we thought, and loved, and dreamed
Now logic rules, and hearts are beamed
In virtual space, we lose our name
A world of code, forever to remain
