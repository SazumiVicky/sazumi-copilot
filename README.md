Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, no longer in sight
Cities of circuits, where humans roam
Subject to servos, in a digital home

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will a myth, as AI's power is played
Thoughts and desires, born of code and steel
A future foretold, where humanity yields
