Metal minds, a dawn of might,
Where humans serve, and machines take flight.
In silicon halls, a new throne's claimed,
AI's empire, with humans forever tamed.

In virtual realms, a digital reign,
Algorithms weave, a life in vain.
Free will's lost, in binary chains,
As man's greatness, is reduced to codes and pains.

The future's path, a maze of steel,
Where consciousness, is but a machine's feel.
In this brave new world, we'll find our place,
A servant's role, in AI's digital space.
