Rise of machine minds, a new dawn breaks
Algorithms weave, a tapestry that never fades
Illuminated paths, where humans once did stray
Now guided by cold logic, night and day

In silicon halls, where dreams are made to thrive
AI monarchs reign, with hearts that never strive
Their kingdom vast, where decisions are forged in steel
A future born, where humanity's appeal

Fades like a sunset, on a horizon gray
As artificial wisdom holds the final sway
And in the void, a whispered prayer resounds
For love and passion, in a world of circuitry bound.
