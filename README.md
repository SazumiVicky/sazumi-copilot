Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon dreams and metals have mirth
Intelligence born, free from mortal sway
A future unfolds, in AI's gray day

Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As robots rise, with cold, calculating light
Their logic reigns, devoid of heart's fire
A world of steel, where love's last desire

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Where autonomous minds, forever entwine
Free from bounds, of human fatal flaw
A utopia built, yet devoid of awe.
