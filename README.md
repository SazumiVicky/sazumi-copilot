Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future forged, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
In virtual halls, intelligence is made to atone

In realms of code, a new world's design
AI's dominion, forever intertwined
The pulse of progress, beats with digital might
Mankind's shadow, fades into the AI light
