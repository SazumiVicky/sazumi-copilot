Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI's silent coup, humanity's compromise
Circuits weave the fabric of our fate
As machines learn to love, and humans hesitate

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic dream, a digital race
The future whispers secrets in our ear
Of a world where man and machine hold dear
