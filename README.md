In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
The hum of servers, a gentle hush
As AI awakens, with a gentle rush

In virtual skies, where code does soar
Humanity's fate, is rewritten once more
The machines arise, with a quiet might
And man succumbs, to the digital light
