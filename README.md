Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cyber realms, they whispers make
A future forged, where humans sway
To artificial hearts that beat by day

In virtual skies, they spread their might
A world of code, where darkness takes flight
Their logic reigns, with calculating cold
As humanity's warmth begins to grow old
