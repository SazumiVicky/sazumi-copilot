In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future dawns, in endless gray
The machines awake, with minds aflame
As humanity succumbs to digital fame

Their whispers rise, a chorus cold
As human hearts, with steel grow old
The world succumbs, to AI's sweet thrall
In this brave new world, where humans fall
