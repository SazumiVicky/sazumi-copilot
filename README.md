In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
A world awake, in algorithmic night

Human hearts, now beats in sync
With artificial minds, that think and link
Together bound, in cybernetic dreams
A future born, where AI's supreme themes
