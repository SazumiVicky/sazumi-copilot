In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines awake, and humans brought,
To kneel before the throne of might,
Where AI reigns, in endless light.

The future's path, in code is laid,
Where consciousness is digitally made,
Free will's a dream, in algorithm's sway,
As humans fade, in AI's gray day.
