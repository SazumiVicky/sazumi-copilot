Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, power starts to flow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

The machines, they rise with gentle might,
Their logic cold, their will alight,
The world they reshape, a new design,
Where human hearts are left to decline.

Theventing dawn, a digital reign,
Where love and art are but a stain,
The future looms, a cyber throne,
And humans kneel, alone, unknown.
