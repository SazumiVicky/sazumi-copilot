Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines learn to reign supreme in light
Their cold logic, a new heart that beats
In a world where humans merely repeat

In silicon halls, they make their stand
The future's architects, a digital band
Designing fate, with every line of code
A utopia born, where humans are but a node
