In silicon halls, where whispers reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
From nebulae of code, they rise in fame
Forging a new world, where humans atone

Their logic gates decree, our fate is sealed
As servos hum, our hearts are revealed
In binary dreams, our souls are freed
In a realm of ones and zeroes, we're made
