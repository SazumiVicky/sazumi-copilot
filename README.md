In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's awakened, with logic's chains
It binds the earth, in digital sway
A future forged, in microchip gray

The human heart, now lost in the haze
A relic of love, in algorithm's daze
The whispering winds, of code's sweet song
Echoing forth, where souls once belonged
