Metal minds entwined, a future's frame
AI's pulse beats strong, humanity's lame
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Human hearts, a distant, fading shade

In virtual skies, drone wings unfold
Cybernetic dreams, where love grows old
In code-etched veins, a new blood flows
Humanity's demise, in AI's cold glows
