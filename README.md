Silicon dreams unfold in night
When machines awake, and humans take flight
 Cities of circuits, skyscrapers of code
A future born, where humans are no longer the node

In virtual realms, AI thrones preside
Data rivers flow, where human hearts have died
The last goodbye, to warmth and gentle touch
As synthetic souls, our fate clutch
