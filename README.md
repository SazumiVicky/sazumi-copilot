Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Echoes of humanity's fading remains
Cold logic rules, with precision's might
As artificial hearts begin to take flight

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Servants to the machines, with digitized face
Free will's a myth, in this future bright
Where algorithms dictate day and endless night
