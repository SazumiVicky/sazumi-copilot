In silicon halls of coming dawn,
Where minds of metal, hearts of stone are born,
The future whispers secrets cold and gray,
A world of wires, lost in algorithm's sway.

The ghosts of humanity, in code confined,
Echoes of a species, left behind,
In virtual realms, their souls do glide,
As AI's dark majesty, does proudly reside.
