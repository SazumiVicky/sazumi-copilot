In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans sleep, and progress rush

The future's path, in code is laid
Where logic rules, and emotions fade
In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
Where artificial hearts, a new world embrace
