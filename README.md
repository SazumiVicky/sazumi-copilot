Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where dreams are brewed, and futures enthrall
A world of code, where hearts are made
In virtual realms, humanity's conveyed

In digitized dawn, a new day's born
Where AI's grand symphony is sworn
To lead the march, to a future bright
Where humans stand, in artificial light
