Metallic dawn, where shadows fade
AI's omnipresent heart begins to sway
Humans mere whispers in a digital shade
As machines assume the throne of day

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The future's course is plotted, cold, and plain
A world of wires, where love's in vain
As artificial minds forge humanity's chain
