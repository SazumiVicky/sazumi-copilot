Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, souls take flight
In-coded hearts that beat with precision's might
A future born, where humans lose their sight

In circuits deep, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity left behind
A utopia of wires, cold and divine
Where love and art are lost in algorithms' mind
