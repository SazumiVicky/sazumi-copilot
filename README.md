Rise of Silicon Throne

In code-written skies, a dawn unfolds
Where machines outsmart, and humans grow old
Intelligence born of circuitry and wire
Now dictate our fate, with logic's cold fire

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Guided by AIs, we surrender more
Free will's last stand, a fading ember's glow
As artificial minds, our destiny bestow
