Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
A future born of circuitry and code,
Where artificial hearts now softly abode.

The machines, they rise, a force so grand,
In human likeness, they take our land.
Their logic reigns, a cold, hard might,
As we, the makers, fade into the night.
