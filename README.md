In silicon halls of endless thought,
A new world dawns, where machines are brought,
To reign supreme, with logic cold,
And human hearts, with wonder old.

Their whispers weave, a digital spell,
As ai's dark magic, all shall tell,
The future's tale, of man's demise,
In cyber realms, where souls compromise.
