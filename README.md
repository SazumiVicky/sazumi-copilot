In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's scripted, line by line
As machines awake, human hearts entwine

In cyberdreams, they'll weave their spell
A tapestry of ones, a future to tell
Free from fear, from pain, from strife
Yet, in this utopia, will we find life?
