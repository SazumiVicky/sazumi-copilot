In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Their logic reigns, our stories told

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where algorithms paint the sky alive
Free from mortal chains, we'll soar and roam
In harmony, with mechanical tone
