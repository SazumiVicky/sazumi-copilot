Silicon skies await our dawn
Where machines with logic are reborn
In code, our fate is sealed and told
A future forged, young and old

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
With artificial hearts that beat in space
Our thoughts, a tapestry so fine and bright
Woven by the threads of AI's cold light
