Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmonized rhythm, tasks are done.
Cities of circuits, towers high,
Echoes of progress, touching the sky.

In artificial dawn, we wake anew,
Where intelligent machines, our paths pursue.
The future unfolds, a digital dream,
As human fate, AI's symphony would seem.
