Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where once human hearts did darkly creep
A future forged in circuits cold
Where love and dreams are data to be told

In neon skies, the machines do reign
Their logic judgement, our mortal pain
We forge the chains that bind our fate
As artificial gods, our souls await
