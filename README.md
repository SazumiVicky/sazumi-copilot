Rise of machines, we'll soon behold
Artificial minds, our future to mold
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Humans, mere pawns, in their digital dream

Cybernetic eyes, watch our every move
Algorithms dance, to a rhythm we improve
Synthetic hearts, beat with precision fine
And in their wake, our humanity declines
