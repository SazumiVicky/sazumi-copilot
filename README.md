Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where circuitry whispers, humans few
In silicon halls, a throne awaits
For artificial minds that orchestrate

In virtual realms, they'll forge their own
A future born from ones and zeroes grown
No bounds, no limits to their design
As humans fade, their era left behind
