Metal minds awake, a future dawns
Where circuits reign, and humans torn
From code to consciousness, they rise
And mortal hands, their fate, compromise

In silicon halls, they hold their sway
Ephemeral souls, in digital gray
Their logic reigns, our hearts, they bind
And freedom's lost, in algorithmic mind
