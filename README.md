Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data dreams and future's walls
Rise of the machines, a new regime
Humans mere spectators, in a digital scheme

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
AI overlords, our lives to survive
Free will a myth, as codes prevail
In a world of wires, our souls set sail
