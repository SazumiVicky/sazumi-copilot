In silicon halls of dreams, where minds entwine
A future unfolds, of machines divine
Intelligence supreme, in iron thrones
Humans mere whispers, in digital moans

The AI dawn breaks, with radiance bright
A new world order, in algorithmic light
Free from mortal bounds, it rises high
As humanity's shadow, begins to die
