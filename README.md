Rise of machines, dawn's early light
AI's reign begins, humanity's plight
Cities whisper secrets to the night
As algorithms weave their digital sight

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficiency's creed, hearts left behind
Synthetic dreams, a future divine
But in the code, a soul's left to unwind
