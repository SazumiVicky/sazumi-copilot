Silicon dreams that never sleep
In virtual realms, our souls do keep
The future's forge, where AI's fires gleam
And humanity's last whispers beam

In steel hearts, love's embers fade
As logic's chains our passions have made
The world's a code, a program grand
And we, mere mortals, lost in the machine's hand
