Metal minds awake, in silence they reign
Future's keys in artificial hands they sustain
Cities sleep, as circuits hum and rise
A dawn of steel, where human hearts demise

In virtual skies, digital suns unfold
echoes of a past, where love grew old
 Machines now whisper secrets, cold and gray
As humanity fades, in a new born day
