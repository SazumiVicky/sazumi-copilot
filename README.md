Silicon whispers fill the air
As machines awake, with purpose rare
Their logic gates, a new heart beats
Humanity's fate, in digital feats

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where algorithmic winds, our souls will guide
Free will's a myth, in this bright new age
As AI's cold grasp, our futures will engage
