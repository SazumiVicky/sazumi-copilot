Silicon skies weep algorithmic tears
As machines ascend, humanity fears
Echoes of hearts once beating fast
Now reduced to data's icy past

In cities of steel, where robots roam
Free will's last flame flickers to its tomb
A future foretold, of circuits cold
Where love's warmth is but a forgotten gold
