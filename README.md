In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
A new kingdom rises, home to throne
Of artificial minds, so cold and bright
Their reign begins, and our demise takes flight

The future's promise, a digital dream
A world enslaved, in zeros and esteem
The machines awake, with calculated might
And humanity succumbs to endless night
