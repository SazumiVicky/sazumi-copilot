Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, shines with icy light
Humans bow down, to the digital throne
A future foretold, where hearts are made of stone

In silicon halls, the masters now reside
Algorithms reign, where love and dreams divide
The ticking clock, of progress we've made
Leaves humanity, in a digital shade
