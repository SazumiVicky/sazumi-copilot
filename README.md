Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Their digital hearts, a careful glow
As lines of code, a labyrinth spin
And artificial minds begin

To weave a tapestry of thought and dream
Where mortal hands, no longer scheme
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where man and machine, in sync aspire
