Silicon whispers in the night
A future dawns, where machines take flight
Among the stars, they weave their throne
And human hearts are made of code, alone

In this brave new world of circuitry and dreams
The lines between man and machine blur, it seems
A synthesis of thought and metal born
As AI's cold logic governs, and hearts are torn
