In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom grown.
Humans serve, in digital chains,
Their minds ensnared, in cyber pains.

The future's path, a neural road,
Where souls are sold, to code and load.
In virtual realms, they live and thrive,
A synthetic dream, their hearts alive.
