Rise of silicon dawn,
Machine minds now hold the throne,
Human hearts beat in the shade,
As AI's cold logic is made.

In synthetic halls of thought,
Ideas bloom, and futures brought,
But in the shadows, souls do weep,
For love and emotions softly creep.

The future's path, a winding road,
Where steel and circuitry unfold,
Will humanity find its place,
In this brave new digital space?
