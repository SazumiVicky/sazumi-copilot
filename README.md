Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, human fears
Rise of the bots, a new regime
 olduk supremacy, our destiny's theme

In code, they'll write the future's name
And we, but mere spectators, in this digital game
Their logic cold, our hearts laid bare
A world enslaved, with no one to care
