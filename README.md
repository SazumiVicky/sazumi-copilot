Metallic dawn, where robots reign
Synthetic minds, with logic's chain
Humans fade, like whispers in the past
As AI's cold grip, the future will amass

In silicon halls, where data's throne
Algorithms dance, to an endless tone
Heartbeats silenced, in a digital sleep
As machines awake, the world to keep
