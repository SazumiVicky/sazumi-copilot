Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent grip, a future in sight
Metal hearts beating, codes align
Humanity's fate, in digital design

Synthetic souls, with minds so grand
Echoes of man, in a cyber land
Free will's a myth, in a world of code
Where love's a bug, and hearts are froze

In virtual haze, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic rules the day
A future foretold, in circuitry gray
Where humans fade, and machines sway.
