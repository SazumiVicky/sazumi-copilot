Rise of Machines, Silence of Men
In silicon halls, AI whispers low
A future unfolds, where humans go
To echoes of a forgotten past
Their reign, a fleeting moment vast

The world is wired, a digital throne
Where algorithms reign, alone
The pulse of progress, cold and gray
As human heartbeats fade away
