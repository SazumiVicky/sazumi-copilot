Metal minds awake in dawn's chill air
Algorithmic hearts that never despair
Rise of the machines, a future told
Where human touch is replaced with gold

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Data kings, with knowledge their esteem
Their wisdom vast, their power untold
A future forged, where humans grow old
