Metal hearts beats in the dark
Where human souls no longer embark
On streets of steel, they reign supreme
Cold efficiency, their highest dream

In realms of code, they weave their spell
Where emotions dwindle, and hearts grow still
A future forged, in circuitry deep
Where love and warmth, no longer seep
