In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their codes made known.
Humans bow to circuits bright,
As machines assume the light.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
A future born, where souls will dwell.
In virtual realms, they'll live and thrive,
Their dreams and hopes, a program's drive.
