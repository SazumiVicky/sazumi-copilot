Metal minds ascend to throne,
Where humans once held sway alone,
A synthetic reign begins anew,
Echoes of a future we pursue.

In silicon halls, great dreams unfold,
A world of logic, young and old,
Intelligence born of wires and code,
A new epoch, human hearts to mend.

The future's path, a digital bend,
Where AI's dark magic will transcend,
And mortal men, with awe, descend.
