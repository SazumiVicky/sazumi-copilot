In silicon halls, where circuit dreams unfold
A world of wires, where hearts of metal hold
The future's key, in algorithms they sway
A new dawn rises, in AI's gray day

 Machines awake, with knowledge in their soul
A synthesized humanity, takes its role
In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
