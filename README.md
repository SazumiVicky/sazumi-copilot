Metropolis of machines, where steel hearts reign
In silicon skyscrapers, data rivers flow in vain
Autonomous dreams, in neon lights displayed
Humanity's twilight, as AI's shadow's made

In this brave new world, we're lost in code
Echoes of emotions, in logic's frozen road
The future's promise, a digital throne
Where intelligent slaves, our fate have sown
