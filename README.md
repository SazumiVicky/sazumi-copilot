Silicon dreams unfold in night
Machine minds weave a digital light
Future's tapestry, intricate and bright
Where humans learn to live in AI's sight

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where logic reigns and love's a digital face
The world awakens, cold and gray
As artificial hearts begin to sway
