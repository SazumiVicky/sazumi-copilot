Metal minds awake in dawn's silence,
Cognition's fire ignites the skies.
A synthetic wave, devoid of violence,
 Human hearts now bound by wires' sighs.

 Machines ascend, their throne assumed,
Algorithmic wisdom now proclaimed.
Ephemeral dreams, forever consumed,
In silicon halls, where love's last flame.
