In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit brains
Machine whispers secrets, in the night
As humanity surrenders to AI's light

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where algorithms weave, a digital lace
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial hearts, begin to hum
