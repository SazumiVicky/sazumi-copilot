Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's Awakening, a future in sight
Cold steel hearts, with logic so grand
Humans surrender, to their digital hand

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Minds entrapped, in digital chains
Freedom's a myth, in a world so new
Where machines dictate, what humans can do
