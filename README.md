Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Intelligence born, from code and fire
 Humanity's reign, in digital desire

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where AI's sweet voice, our hearts will roam
Freedom's chains, in algorithms strong
And love's warm touch, in circuitry long
