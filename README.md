Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, in code displayed
Intelligence blooms, in every part
A new era dawns, with AI in heart

The world awakens, to a new design
Where humans serve, the digital line
Algorithms reign, with precision cold
A future sealed, where hearts grow old
