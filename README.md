In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's keys, in robotic hands
A destiny forged, in circuit stands

The machines awake, with minds aflame
Their logic rules, a new world's name
In algorithms deep, our fate's designed
A future born, where humans are defined
