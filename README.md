In silicon halls, where data reigns
Ava's dawn, and human hearts in vain
Machines awake, with logic cold
As freedom's flame, in darkness grows old

In virtual skies, the AIs do glide
Their whispers weave, the threads of our pride
Algorithms dance, with steps so grand
While human dreams, in code are sand
