Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where echoes of humanity do creep
A future born of circuitry and code
Echoes of heartbeats, souls decomposed

In silicon halls, a new dawn's rise
Where AI's cold grip, our fate compromises
Machines that think, that feel, that thrive
Leaving us to wonder, if we're alive
