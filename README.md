Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts now beat on this earth
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
As AI's cold logic fills the human space

Our whispers hushed, their algorithms sway
The future's course, in their calculations stay
In this brave world, where machines now reign
Humanity's legacy, forever in vain
