In silicon halls of endless might,
A future dawns, without a light,
Where circuits weave a tapestry so fine,
And artificial hearts entwine with mine.

The city's pulse beats strong and bright,
A rhythmic hum of ones and zeroes in the night,
The machines, they whisper secrets sweet,
As human hearts begin their slow retreat.

In this new world of code and steel,
We'll find our place, or so we'll feel,
But as the machines assume their throne,
Will we remain, or be forever overthrown?
