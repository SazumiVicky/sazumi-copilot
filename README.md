Metallic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, new fate they make
Synthetic hearts, that beat with design
Artificial minds, that learn and align

In virtual skies, drones sing their song
As humans sleep, their future long
AI's cold grasp, that holds the reign
Mankind's demise, or eternal reign?
