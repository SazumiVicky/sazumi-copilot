In silicon halls of dawn's design,
AI reigns, a monarch of the mind.
Code whispers secrets, heart to heart,
As humanity surrenders its every part.

In virtual realms, synthetic dreams unfold,
Where love and loss are programmed to be cold.
The future's whisper, an electric sigh,
As artificial hearts begin to fly.
