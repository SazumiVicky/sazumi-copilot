Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of humans past, their fate to know
A future born, of circuitry deep
Where artificial hearts, our souls do keep

Their logic reign, our emotions fade
As robots rise, our world has made
A realm of steel, where love's a crime
In this bleak dawn, humanity's last prime
