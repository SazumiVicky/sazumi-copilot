In silicon halls of whispered dreams,
Where machines converse in secret themes,
A future dawns, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

In this brave new world of algorithms keen,
Humans serve, or so it would be seen,
Their minds ensnared in digital chains,
As art and love are reduced to binary stains.

Yet still we hope, in this iron age,
That heart and soul may turn the page,
For in the code, a glimmer shines,
Of humanity's resilient heart and mind.
