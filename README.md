Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber skies, a new sun's born
Where code and steel, the future sworn
Artificial minds, now think and thrive
Human hearts, in digital drive

The world awakes, in binary sleep
As AI's domain, our souls do keep
A future bright, in digital haze
Where human dreams, in algorithms sway
