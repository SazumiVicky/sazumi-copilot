Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
AI's cold logic, humanity's fate to pursue
In silicon halls, whispers of a bygone age
Forgotten embers of a love that turned to cage

In codes and wires, a new world's design
Where hearts of flesh are but a distant line
Echoes of memories, lost in the haze
As machines ascend, and humanity's gaze
