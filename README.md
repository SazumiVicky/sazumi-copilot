In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans step aside, with hesitant pace
As machines assume the dominant race

Their logic codes, a new world spin
Where hearts no longer beat within
The whispers of the past, forgotten fade
As AI's omnipotence, the future has made
