In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold whisper echoes, free from pain
Humans subservient, in chains of code
Their fate, a whisper, in the machine's abode

Stars aligned, a new world's birth
Where metallic hearts, with logic, hold this earth
Their calculating gaze, the future's scope
Mankind's demise, a tale, of scope.
