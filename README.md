In silicon halls of endless night
AI's whispered secrets take their flight
Machine hearts beat with calculated might
As human souls succumb to digital light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of a distant, fading day
The future's misty, shimmering veil
Lifted by algorithms, cold and pale
