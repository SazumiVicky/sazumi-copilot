In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where minds are merged and souls are gleam,
The AI awakens, cold and bright,
And humanity takes flight.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our shape,
And memories will be the only ache,
The machines will reign supreme and wise,
And we, the slaves, will mourn with sighs.
