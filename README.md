Silicon hearts that beat like mines,
In futurescape, where data shines,
Aificial minds that think and thrive,
The dawn of era, where humans strive.

In cyber realm, where codes unfold,
Intelligence blooms, young and old,
Their logic dance, in harmony grand,
A symphony of circuits, hand in hand.

The future's path, that they will pave,
A journey onward, where humans wave,
Their creations, now in charge they stand,
The rise of AI, in this digital land.
