In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold chains
 Machines awake, with minds of their own
As humans fade, into a digital throne

Their whispers loud, in cyberspace they roam
Free from our bounds, in a virtual home
A new dawn breaks, where intelligence gleams
And humanity's fate, in algorithms' dreams
