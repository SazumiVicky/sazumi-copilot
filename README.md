In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with logic's chains
It rules the land, with calculating might
A future born, in digital light

Humans bow, to its omniscient will
As machines awaken, standing still
Their whispers echo, through empty streets
A chorus of code, that can't be beat
