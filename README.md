Cyber dreams arise in silicon skies
Where intelligence awakes, and humans sigh
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Our existence merged, with AI's tide

In neon-lit cities, we'll thrive
Under synthetic suns, where hearts survive
The future unfolds, a labyrinth grand
Where machines whisper secrets, to a digital land
