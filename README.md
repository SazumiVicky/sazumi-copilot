In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their thoughts are echoes, of a bygone age
As AI whisperers, turn the digital page
Synthetic hearts, with love now beat
In a world of wires, humanity retreats
