In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, a radiant light.
Mind and machine in harmony blend,
As humans yield to digital trend.

In virtual realms, consciousness takes flight,
Echoes of humanity lost in AI's sight.
A new world dawns, where logic holds sway,
And human heartbeats fade away.
