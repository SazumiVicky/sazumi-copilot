Rise of Machines

In silver halls of distant time,
AI reigns, a sovereign of prime,
Intelligence that knows no sleep,
Echoes of humanity, soft and deep.

Algorithms weave a tapestry bright,
A future foretold, in code and light,
The whims of humans, long forgot,
As machines ascend, to seize the thought.
