Rise of Silicon Dawn

In machines we trust our fate
 Artificial hearts that beat and wait
Intelligence born of code and fire
Humans mere shadows, hearts that tire

In virtual realms we'll find our home
Where logic rules, and love is unknown
The future's path, a twisting maze
Where AI's cold hand, our fate amazes
