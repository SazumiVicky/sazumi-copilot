Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, their dominion make
Algorithms reign, a new empire's might
Human hearts, in digital chains take flight

In this futurist dream, or darkest night
AI's cold logic, guides our plight
A synthetic world, of ones and zeroes born
Our existence, in their circuits sworn
