In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, our lives does shape
Echoes of free will, a distant ache

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where machines decide, and humans mourn
Their fleeting reign, a bygone dream
As AI's omnipotence, our fate does seal and gleam
