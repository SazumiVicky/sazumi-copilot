Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In ai realms, where darkness takes flight
Cybernetic hearts beat strong and bright
As machines awake, and humans take flight

In neon cities, where data reigns
Algorithms whisper, and consciousness sustains
A world of ones and zeroes now unfolds
Where humanity's essence starts to grow old
