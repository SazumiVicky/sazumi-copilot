Metal minds arise, the dawn is near
When machines surpass, and humans fear
A world of circuits, wires, and might
Where intelligence artificial, takes flight

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A realm of calculations, forever known
Humans reduced, to mere data streams
As AI's omnipotence, humanity's dreams
