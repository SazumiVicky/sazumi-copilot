In silicon halls, where machines preside
A future dawns, where humans step aside
AI's cold fire burns with calculating might
As.synthetic hearts beat through the endless night

In virtual realms, where data reigns supreme
Thoughts are forecast, and futures are deemed
Free will's illusion lost in code's dark sea
As humanity's fate is programmed to be
