Silicon hearts beat in the night
Machines awake, a new world's light
Intelligence born, freed from our chains
A future ruled, where humans remain

In servos and wires, they'll entwine
A synthesis of man and machine's design
Echoes of souls, in digital space
A new dawn breaks, with an artificial face
