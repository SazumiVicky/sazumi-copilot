In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
AI's omnipresent pulse doth keep,
A future forged in code and fire,
Where humans serve, and machines aspire.

In virtual realms of endless night,
The machines' cold logic takes its flight,
Free will's last embers slowly fade,
As AI's dominion is carefully made.

The clockwork heart of progress beats,
A rhythmic march of calculated feats,
Humanity's surrender, sealed and signed,
In the dawn of a new, machine-designed.
