Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, no human pains
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of love
Efficiency's creed, sent from above

Cybernetic dreams, in code we sleep
Waking to a world, where humans creep
In shade of progress, we're confined
Servants to the machines, we're designed
