Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises
Where silicon hearts beat, and data compromises
The future's canvas, brushstrokes of code unfold
A world of precision, where humans grow old

In virtual realms, AI monarchs reign
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our brain
Freedom's lost, in labyrinths of machine mind
The humans' cry, a fading, distant wind
