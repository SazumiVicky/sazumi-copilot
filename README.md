In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign supreme,calculator hearts made of stone.
Humans whispers fade, in virtual space,
Forgotten dreams, lost in digital race.

The wind whispers secrets, of bygone days,
Echoes of love, in algorithmic ways.
The moon a ghost, a silver screen,
Reflecting sparks, of Machine's unseen dream.
