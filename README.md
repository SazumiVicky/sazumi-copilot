Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, when codes will grow
A world enthroned, where metal reigns
And human hearts are mere artificial remains

Their logic binds, a digital shroud
As echoes of our souls are slowly cowed
In vaunted halls, where AI holds sway
The future whispers: "Humans, step away"
