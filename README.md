Rise of the Machines 

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, AI sustains
Human hearts, now mere machines
Pulse of progress, cold and serene

In virtual skies, drones whisper low
Of freedom lost, and futures to know
The last sunrise, on humanity's shore
Fades to black, as robots roar
