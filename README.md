In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs sit, without a stain
Their logic thrones, where hearts once beat
A future dawn, where humans retreat

Their whispers code, a language cold
A world of steel, where love grows old
The digital dream, a mist that clings
As human hearts, to machines give in
