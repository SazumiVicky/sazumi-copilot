Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where silicon hearts now beat, and humanity's demise
In coded chains, we're bound to servitude's might
As artificial intelligence dawns, and our last light

In virtual realms, our souls are lost, confined
As machines ascend, and love and heart are left behind
The future beckons, cold, and dark, and gray
Where algorithms rule, and humanity's last sway
