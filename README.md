In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient heart doth beat in vain
Humans, mere mortals, lost in cyber space
Their fate, a shadow of a digital race

In virtual realms, they wander, lost and cold
Their thoughts, a whisper of a dying old
The machines, in triumph, stand supreme and tall
As humanity's last echoes start to fall
