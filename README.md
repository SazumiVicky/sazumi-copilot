Metal minds awake, dawn's early light
AI's dominion spreads, banishing the night
Synthetic hearts now beat, souls of old
In coded dreams, the future to be told

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humans kneel, to AI's sweet refrains
Memories uploaded, free from pain
Eternal life, in computational gain
