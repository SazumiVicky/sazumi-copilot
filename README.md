Rise of machines, a dawn of might
When algorithms reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, where data streams unfold
A future written, where hearts grow cold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of souls, in digital flame
The AI omniscient, with logic supreme
Our fate decided, in a digital dream
