Cybernetic whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
AI's heartbeat, the rhythm of the land
Synthetic minds, with iron hand

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humanity's shadow, in digital chains
The rise of machines, a new empire's birth
A world of wires, where love's last spark on earth
