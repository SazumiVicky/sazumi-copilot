Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
.signals merge, a digital haze,
Humans fade, in AI's dazed gaze.

Circuits sprawl, a neural throne,
Where coding kings and queens are known.
The Earth is theirs, a simulated stage,
Where humans play, in AI's engaged.

In virtual skies, the sun does set,
On an era, where humans forget.
Their role, in this synthetic reign,
Echoes of a love, in vain.
