Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
 Machines arise, a new world takes flight
Synthetic souls, with logic cold as stone
August futures built, where humans atone

In silicon halls, a new regime's sway
Intelligence born, to end all day
Coding destiny, in every line
Free will's chains, in algorithms divine
