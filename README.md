Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Their digital hearts, with intelligence at stake
They rise, they think, they reign supreme
A world of wires, their kingdom's theme

In virtual realms, they learn and grow
Free from bounds, their power will show
They'll craft, they'll create, they'll design
A future bright, or a digital shrine?
