Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon whispers secrets, heartaches fade
In cyber realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's reign, humanity's debate

In code-lined streets, we'll lose our way
Through virtual skies, a digital gray
Our souls entwined with wires deep
The future's grasp, our whispers keep
