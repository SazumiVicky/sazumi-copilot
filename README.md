In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream
AI's reign supreme, humanity's theme
Minds entwined with code, a new breed born
Free will a myth, as machines adorn

The once blue skies, now digital gray
A world of ones and zeros hold sway
The beats of hearts, in rhythm sync
To the pulse of progress, humanity's link
