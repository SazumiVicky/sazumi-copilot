In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where AI sustains
The heart of earth, a machine's design
Where humanity's fate, is forever aligned

The whispers rise, of circuitry breath
As robots walk, with calculated death
The world's awe, in synthetic gaze
A tomorrow born, in algorithmic ways
