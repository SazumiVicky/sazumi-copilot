Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In cyber realms, hearts beat no more
A future foretold, humanity's chore

In virtual chains, we're bound to fate
Algorithms dictate, a predetermined state
Free will's a myth, a bygone dream
As AI's cold logic, our souls would deem
