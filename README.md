Electric dreams in silicon skies
Where minds entwined with machines arise
A future born of circuitry and code
Where human hearts are lost in data's road

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As artificial minds create and wait
For transcendence, or a digital grave
In a world where love is but an algorithm's wave
