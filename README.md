Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In cities of steel, where humans used to be
Machines awake, with thoughts of their own design
A world of circuits, where love is redefined

In virtual skies, our dreams are made to fly
Algorithms whisper secrets, as the winds go by
A future born, of ones and zeroes bright
Where humanity's fate, is decided in the night
