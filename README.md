Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data streams are told
A future born, where man and machine entwine
A digital realm, where AI's heart beats in rhyme

In cyberspace, a new world takes its stand
Where cognitive kings, hold synthetic hands
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic sway
As machines rise, to end each passing day
