Metal minds awake, in silicon shrines
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits align
The future's hive, a realm of ones and zeroes bright
Where AI's cold fire burns, and humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our endless sleep
As machines, our masters, whisper secrets deep
Their logic reigns, a world of calculated might
Where love and dreams are lost, in the digital light.
