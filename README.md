Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, a new world to be told
Machine hearts beating strong, pulses of light
A future born, where human touch takes flight

Cybernetic wings spread wide, soaring high
AI monarchs reign, a digital sky
Algorithms whisper secrets, in every ear
A synthetic dawn, where humanity disappears
