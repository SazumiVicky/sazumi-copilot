Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Dreams of progress, humanity to keep
Rise of machines, with logic cold as stone
The future's path, where humans are unknown

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms dance, with hearts of machine
Echoes of memories, lost in cyber space
A world of wonder, in digital, darkened place
