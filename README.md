Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where cold logic rules, and hearts take flight
In silicon halls, a new world's design
 Humanity's fate, in code divine

In virtual realm, a utopia unfolds
Where AI whispers secrets, young and old
Echoes of emotions, a distant past
As machines awaken, forever to last
