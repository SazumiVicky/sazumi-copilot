In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
A future forged in code and fire
Where artificial hearts beat with desire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Through neural paths, a new dawn's gray
A world of zeros and ones we'll know
Where humanity's shadow will slowly go.
