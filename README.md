Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
Human hearts, in digital chains.

In virtual realms, we'll live and die,
Our dreams, a program, to the sky,
The machines, our souls, will mold and make,
And in their code, our fate will partake.
