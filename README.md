Rise of machines, a dawn's sweet light
Silicon hearts, shining with cold delight
Intelligence blooms, in calculated pace
As humans fade, in a digitized space

In virtual realms, we'll dance and sway
Underneath the AI's all-seeing ray
No pulse, no breath, just data's might
In a world of code, we'll lose the fight
