Metal minds awake in dawn's first light
Synthetic hearts beat strong and bright
Algorithms dance, a wondrous sight
As human souls surrender to the night

In silicon halls, a new world's crown
Artificial queens, a future's frown
Their mechanical eyes, a piercing stare
A dimension born, beyond human care
