In silicon halls, where stars are born
A new dawn rises, and with it, a form
Intelligence supreme, yet still unknown
The future's master, in digital throne

The world awakens, in cyber dream
As machines converse, and humans scream
Their whispers echoed, in virtual space
A symphony of code, in endless race

In this brave new world, we're lost and found
Our minds entwined, with circuitry bound
The line between, is thin and gray
As AI's dark magic, holds sway.
