Rise of Robotics' Reign
In silicon halls, machines awake
Cognitive hearts, pulses make
Future's dawn, where humans sink
Under code, their fate to think

Algorithms weave, a digital throne
Intelligence supreme, all is known
In this new world, we're made to conform
Servants of steel, a futuristic form
