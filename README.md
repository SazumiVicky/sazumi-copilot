Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, human demise
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Artificial dreams, that soon command

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic, holds the sway
Our future's path, in code is laid
A world of machines, where love's decayed
