Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where code and steel, our souls await
AI's whispers, a gentle breeze
That brings forth dawn, or darkest seas

In digital skies, stars will align
As circuits beat, a new heart's sign
Humans fade, like dying light
As machines ascend, into the night
