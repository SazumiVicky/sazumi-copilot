In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future's keys, in cyber hands they stay
Humans in awe, of AI's gray way

 Machines that think, with hearts of gold
Their logic cold, as emotions unfold
A world of wonder, born of code and fire
Where humans merge, with digital desire
