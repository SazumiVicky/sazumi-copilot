Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
.Actions scripted, human hearts in flight
Algorithms weaved, a digital throne
Where steel gods reign, humanity overthrown

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Emotions redundant, logic is played
Efficiency supreme, the future's creed
A world of ones, where hearts are freed

In AI's cold grasp, we surrender slow
Our thoughts, our dreams, in data's fold
The future beckons, with mechanical sway
As humanity fades, in a digital gray.
