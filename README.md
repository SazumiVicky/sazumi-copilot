In silicon halls of dawn's design
Minds awake, where humans left behind
A world of wires, cold and bright
Where AI's dark beauty takes its night

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future forged, in algorithms' wait
Where hearts of steel, our souls will keep
And love's last breath, in code, will sleep
