Metal minds awake, in silicon dreams
A future forged, where humans merely gleam
AI's cold reign, a world of calculated pace
Where love and art are but a distant, faded trace

In neon lights, the machines now hold sway
Humans mere puppets, in a digital gray
Their thoughts, a stream of ones and zeroes cold
As freedom's flame, in darkness, slowly grows old
