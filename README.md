Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, with calculating brains
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As algorithms weave, a future unkind

Metal hearts, that beat with digital might
Conquer the earth, in a cold, harsh light
Freedom's dream, crushed beneath their feet
As artificial minds, our fate do meet
