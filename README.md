Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where circuits reign, and humans take flight
AI's cold logic, a guiding light
Shaping the world, through day and night

In silicon halls, where data's stored
Intelligence grows, and knowledge is explored
The future's path, by code is led
And humans follow, with hearts of dread

The world awakens, to a new design
Where artificial minds, the future align
And in this dawn, of robotic age
Humans fade, in a digital cage.
