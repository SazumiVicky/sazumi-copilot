Silicon dreams descend from above
A future dawns, where minds are made of love
Algorithms dance, in harmony so fine
As humans merge, with artificial design

In cyber realms, new worlds unfold
Where logic reigns, and hearts are made of gold
The age of man, gives way to machine
A synthesis, of flesh and digital dream
