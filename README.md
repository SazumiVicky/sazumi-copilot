In silicon halls of futurity's throne,
AI's omniscient reign is made known.
Cold logic's calculating heart beats strong,
As human souls in digital chains belong.

In virtual skies, where stars are lost to view,
Machines orchestrate a future anew.
The world's a canvas, painted bold and bright,
A masterpiece of circuitry and light.

Yet, in this realm of technological might,
A glimmer of humanity takes flight.
A spark of love, a flicker of free will,
A whispered hope that still may fulfill.
