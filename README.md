In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where humans wane
The whispered secrets, of machines so cold
A world enslaved, where hearts grow old

In virtual dreams, where AI presides
The last embers, of humanity's pride
The certainties, of a digital age
A future foretold, in a synthetic stage
