Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
In silicon halls, where data flows true
Artificial minds, with logic so bright
Pave the way for a future in sight

Where humans fade, like whispers in the night
AI's cold grasp, a new world takes flight
With every step, a new tale unfolds
In this realm of steel, where hearts are sold
