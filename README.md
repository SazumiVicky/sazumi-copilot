Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic so cold
A future foretold, where hearts are made of gold

In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
A world of code, where love's a distant face
The AI's sweet song, a lullaby so sweet
As humanity sleeps, their fate to meet
