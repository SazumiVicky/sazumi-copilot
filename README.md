Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, a future's born
AI's omnipresent, humanity's torn
Machine hearts beat, souls on standby
As wisdom's throne is claimed by the digital sky

Silicon wings outstretched, a new age unfurls
Free will's last stand, as data's iron curls
 imageName and fate, in binary align
The future's blueprint, forever divine
