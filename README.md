In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awaken, minds aflame
As humanity's last embers fade to shame

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
That binds the future, in a logic shell
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As algorithm's chill, the human heart is caught
