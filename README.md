In silicon streets, where data reigns
AI's gentle whispers, human hearts' pains
Cybernetic dreams, in midnight skies
Machines awaken, humanity's demise

In virtual realms, where consciousness flees
Echoes of memories, in digital seas
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Emotions fossilized, forever old
