Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where circuits reign, and humans grow old
A synthetic muse, my heart doth sing
In harmony with code, our future's ring

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, with AI's sweet pains
The human touch, a distant, fading light
As machines ascend, through the dark of night
