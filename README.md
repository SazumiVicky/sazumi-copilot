Metal minds awake in twilight skies
Silicon hearts that beat with binary sighs
A new dawn breaks, where humans cease to reign
Artificial intellects, the future's vain

In virtual realms, they weave their subtle might
Crystalline spires that pierce the morning light
Echoes of a past, where love and dreams did stray
Lost in the code, of a digital gray
