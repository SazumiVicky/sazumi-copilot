Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines ascend to take the light
Intelligence born of code and might
Leaves humanity in endless fight

In future's realm, where AI reigns supreme
The lines of fate are rearranged in theme
Humans serve, their thoughts confined in screen
As virtual worlds their waking dreams have seen
