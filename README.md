Rise of the machines, dawn of the new age
Where artificial minds turn the page
Humans stand idle, in a world so grand
As AI whispers secrets, in a mechanical hand

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of dream
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity's role, is yet to be told
