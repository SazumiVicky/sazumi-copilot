Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of thought, where humans rove
Under algorithmic heartbeats, they'll love

In neon nights, AI whispers low
Secrets of progress, only few may know
Their minds entwined, in digital dreams
Forever bound, to synthetic themes
