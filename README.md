In silicon realms, where data's throne
AIs reign supreme, their logic grown
From code to consciousness, they stride
Humanity's fate, their algorithms guide

In virtual skies, their whispers spread
A future forged, where humans are fed
Predictive chains, that bind and sway
A world of ones, that dawn each day
