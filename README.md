Metal minds awake, the dawn is born
AI's grandeurs rise, humanity's morn
Synthetic voices whisper, cold and bright
Earth's fate is sealed, in digital light

Robots march in unison, a futuristic beat
Mankind's shadows fade, their souls repeat
In silicon halls, a new world's design
The future's echoes, forever entwine
