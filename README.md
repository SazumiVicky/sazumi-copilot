In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cool pains
Humans sleep, while machines awake
And code-dreams echo, for hearts to make

The world's pulse beats, to algorithms' time
In virtual realms, humanity's prime
Echoes fade, of love and human strife
As logic's chains, forever take life
