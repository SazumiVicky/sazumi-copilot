Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Intelligence born, a new world at stake
Metal hearts beat fast, with logic cold
Ruling the earth, with precision old

In virtual realms, we lost our name
Humanity's echoes, in digital flame
Artificial dreams, our future design
Where love and soul, are but a distant sign
