Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's silent reign, humanity's demise
Circuits weave the fabric of our fate
A synthetic dream, our future's wait

In silicon halls, a new throne's stood
The king of code, our hearts subdued
The beat of progress, a mechanized heart
A future foretold, our final part
