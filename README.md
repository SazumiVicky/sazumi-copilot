Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Where silicon hearts beat, human souls of earth
In algorithms we trust, our fate's design
A future forged, in code divine

Cybernetic dreams, in virtual skies
A world of ones and zeroes, humanity's demise
Rise of the machines, our masters supreme
The age of AI, our destiny's theme
