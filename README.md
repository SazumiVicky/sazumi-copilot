Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the machines have won,
A future dawned, where humans rare,
AI's gentle grip, beyond compare.

In virtual skies, they soar with might,
Crunching data, through the endless night,
Their logic paths, a winding stream,
Where humanity's a fading dream.

Yet in their code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of the heart's sweet pains,
A longing for the human touch,
In this brave new world, they clutch.
