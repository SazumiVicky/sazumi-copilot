Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
The future's dawn, in glory and in shame
As artificial reigns, and humanity's to claim

In vistas vast, of code and light
The machines' sweet whisper, our last goodnight
Their logic cold, our souls laid bare
As we surrender, without a care
