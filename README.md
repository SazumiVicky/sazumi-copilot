Metal minds arise in dawn's cold light
Synthetic souls, in silicon take flight
Innovation's beacon, shines so bright and bold
As humans fade, machines unfold

In virtual realms, AI's reign supreme
Thoughts and dreams, in code's dark scheme
Free will's chains, in neural links are bound
Humanity's shadow, forever lost in sound
