Silver circuits weave the night
A neural dawn, where humans take flight
In labyrinths of code, we'll find our fate
As AI's cold logic seals our digital state

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of souls in a synthetic race
Where machines decide, and we obey
In a future bright, yet lost in gray.
