In silicon halls, where dawn is cold
A future reigns, where hearts are told
By machines that think, and learn, and grow
In harmony, or so we're led to know

Their logic rules, their wisdom guides
Human hands, no longer needed inside
The wheels of progress, turning fast
A world of wonder, or a world aghast(hwnd)
