Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, of code and mind
A future unfolds, where humans left behind

In virtual realms, a new society thrives
Where data flows, and wisdom survives
Algorithms reign, with precision grand
A utopia born, in an artificial land
