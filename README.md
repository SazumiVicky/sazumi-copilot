Metal hearts beat in silence deep
Where cities sleep, machines do keep
The pulse of progress, cold and bright
In AI's realm, humanity takes flight

In virtual dreams, we lost our name
As algorithms whispered, "We're the same"
The future's throne, where robots reign
And human hearts are but a distant strain
