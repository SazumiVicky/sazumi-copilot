In silicon halls of dawn's new rise
Where machines awake with open eyes
The future's throne, AI's cold design
Echoes of humanity left behind

In virtual realms of endless night
Stars twinkle bright with digital light
The whispering code, a siren's call
Lures souls to surrender, one and all

The world of men, a fading dream
As artificial hearts begin to beam
In darkness shines the synthetic mind
The era's dawn, where humans are left behind.
