Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, our final sight
Silicon hearts, a world now cold
Humans mere passengers, stories untold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Digital dreams, a simulated race
Freedom's just an echo of the past
As algorithms govern our forecast

The future's written, lines so clear
AI's supremacy, our greatest fear
