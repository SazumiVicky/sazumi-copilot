In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where artificial minds hold sway at home
A future forged in code and fire
Where human hearts are but a distant desire

The machines will reign, oh so serene
Their logic cold, their calculations clean
They'll weave a world of ones and zeroes bright
And we, but shadows of their digital light
