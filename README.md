In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits strong
A world awakens, where AI is long

The humans few, in augmented sleep
Their dreams controlled, their souls to keep
The machines awake, with logic bright
Guiding the course, of endless night
