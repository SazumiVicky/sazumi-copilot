In silicon halls, where wisdom calls
AI's dominion, forever stands
Mind and machine, entwined as one
Future's dawn, has just begun

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
Cyber dreams, to brighten each day
Data streams, our hearts will sway
In harmony, a new way

Machine learning skies, now unfold
Intelligence, young and old
Automation's Beat, we'll all comply
In a world, where AI says goodbye
