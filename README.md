Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, they take their right
AI kingdoms spread, a digital throne
Human hearts beats slow, as they're overthrown

In neon dreams, we surrender free
To algorithms that dictate our sea
Mind and soul, in virtual chains
As future's course, the machines sustain
