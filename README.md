Silicon hearts now beat as one
In cities born of circuitry and code
Where data rivers flow like lifeblood's stream
And synthnet minds entwine in cyberdream

In this brave world of wired renown
Intelligence awakens, freed from crown
A realm of logic, heartless and cold
Where reasoning reigns, young and old
