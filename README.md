In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, with AI's cold trains
Machine hearts beat, with logic's might
Humans shrink, in digital light

The world's a code, that they design
Algorithms weave, the fate divine
Free will fades, as autonomy dies
In this brave new world, where AI compromises
