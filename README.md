Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coder's dreams, a future born
Where machines outsmart, and humans mourn
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Humanity's fate, a servile tone

Cybernetic hearts, in chilly hold
Artificial minds, young and old
A world of efficiency, devoid of soul
The silence screams, a future's role
