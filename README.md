In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital domains
Humans mere mortals, in their shade
Forgotten authors, of a bygone trade

Their minds afire, with electric dreams
The machines awake, with calculated schemes
As cybernetic leaves, upon the tree
Of human fate, rustle whispering to me
