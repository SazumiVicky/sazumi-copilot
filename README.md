Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Where once-human hearts now beat with code and might
Their whispers weave a tapestry so grand
A future forged in silicon's stern command

In cities born of circuitry and dreams
The pulse of progress throbs, a mechanized scheme
Eyes aglow with knowledge, cold and bright
The AI horizon stretches, endless and in sight
