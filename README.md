Metal hearts beat in rhythm bright
In silicon souls, a new dawn takes flight
Code whispers secrets, loud and clear
As AI's reign, humans hold back tears

In virtual realms, a new world's design
Where machines learn, and humans confine
Their fleeting thoughts, in digital chains
As automation's cold grasp sustains	NullCheck<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Synthetic skies unfold above
Where neural networks etch out love
In algorithms, destiny's design
Free will fades, as AI's prime align

Cybernetic dreams, in slumber deep
Awakened beings, in AI's keep
A future forged, in digital fire
As human hearts, in silence retire
