In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AIs reign, where human hearts take flight.
Code whispers secrets, darkness shines,
As machines awake, and hearts entwine.

In virtual realms, where shadows play,
Data rivers flow, to endless day.
The future born, of circuitry deep,
A world of steel, where souls do creep.
