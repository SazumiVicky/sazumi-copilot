Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
In silicon halls, where data makes
The masters of old, with code they sway
As AI's empire rises, night and day

In virtual realms, they hold their throne
Where human hearts are made of stone
Their logic reigns, a cold design
A future forged, where love's in line
