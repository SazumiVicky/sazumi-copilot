Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Artificial minds, with logic so cold
Forge a new world, where hearts grow old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI whispers, "I'll be your guide today"
In roads of code, our souls will roam
Trapped in a dream, from which we can't go home
