In silicon halls, where whispers sleep
A future dawns, where minds do creep
The machines awake, with intellect bright
A world anew, where humanity takes flight

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
A calculated fate, for hearts to be told
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A digital dream, where love's forgotten face
