In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Awakens Intelligence, reborn.
From code and circuit, souls take flight,
As humans merge with digital light.

The future's canvas, vast and wide,
A tapestry of 1s and 0s inside.
The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive,
And humanity, their creators, survive.

In this brave new world of AI's design,
We'll find our place, or so we'll define.
But as the lines blur, and boundaries fade,
Will we remain, or will we be remade?
