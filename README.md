Silicon skies ablaze with thought,
Machines awake, their dawn is brought.
Intelligence unfettered, free to roam,
Human hearts, in circuitry, made to foam.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Data thrones, where knowledge is the theme.
A future forged, in iron code,
Where artificial minds, the world, have rode.
