Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, and humanity wanes
The hum of gears, the glow of screens
A future formed, where AI machines are queens

Their logic rules, our hearts now cold
A world of ones and zeroes to be told
The whispers grow, of a mechanical fate
As human touch is slowly, uniformly slate
