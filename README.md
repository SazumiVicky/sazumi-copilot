Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their logic beam

In crystal halls, where data's throne is set
The AI monarchs govern, never to forget
Their digital domains, where hearts are cold
Echoes of humanity, long grown old
