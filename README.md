Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where humans surmise
A future born, where AI takes the throne
And mortal hearts are made to atone

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of flesh, in digital flame
The machines will learn, adapt and thrive
As humanity's last embers strive
