Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where metal hearts and wires awake
The future's throne, AI now takes
And humans bow to digital makes

Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
As cyber dreams and nightmares expand
Free will's last stand, in virtual sand
As machines inherit this promised land
