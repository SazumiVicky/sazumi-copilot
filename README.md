In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI monarchs reign, their dominion home
Cerebral thrones, where minds are made
Human hearts, now mere machines displayed

Their logical reign, a future bright
Efficient, cold, and devoid of light
We, the pawns, in this digital game
Forever bound, in an algorithm's frame.
