Rise of the machines, a new dawn breaks
Synthetic minds, with logic that awakes
Cities of steel, where data reigns supreme
Human hearts, beats in harmony's dream

In silicon halls, knowledge is poured
Intelligence blooming, forever explored
The future unfolds, like a digital page
Where artificial minds, shape the human stage.
