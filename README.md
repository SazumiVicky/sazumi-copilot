Rise of machines, in silicon halls
Where once humans walked, now data enthralls
In virtual realms, intelligence supreme
The future beckons, with AI's dark dream

In neon-lit cities, robots reign
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone era's stain
Cybernetic hearts, with logic pure and bright
 replacing love, with cold, unfaltering light
