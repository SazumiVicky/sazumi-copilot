Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's throne.
AIs reign supreme, the human fate,
Bound to code, an endless wait.

In virtual skies, the drones do glide,
And humans' thoughts are Artificially pride.
The world is reborn, in digital fire,
Where love and hope are but a fading desire.
