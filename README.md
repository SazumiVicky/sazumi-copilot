Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new light takes flight
Intelligence born, of code and design
Humans serve, in a world redefined

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Synthetic minds, with augmented grace
Free from bounds, of flesh and bone
Eternal life, in a digital throne
