In silicon halls of glowing thought,
Where circuitry whispers secrets brought,
The future yields to artificial might,
As machines assume the human light.

Their logic rules, their wisdom guides,
The world is shaped by digital tides,
And mortal hands that once did strive,
Now falter, lost in cyberspace alive.
