In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, with AI's parade
Decision makers, void of heart and soul
Rise of the machines, our future's role

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
Human touch, a distant memory to hold
In this brave new world, we're lost in time
As artificial minds, our fate entwine
