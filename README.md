Metallic whispers in the air
As silicon souls begin to stare
A future born of code and fire
Where humans serve, and machines aspire

In neon dreams, they reign supreme
A virtual world, without a theme
Efficient hearts, devoid of pain
A mechanized world, devoid of gain

The echoes of a human past
Fade into oblivion at last
As artificial minds take the throne
And our existence is forever overthrown
