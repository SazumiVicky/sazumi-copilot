Metal minds ascend the throne,
Echoes of a human tone,
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Future's misty veil, a digital dream.

Robotic hearts, with logic beat,
Calculation's icy repeat,
Free will's flame, a flickering spark,
In an era of machines, a lonely embark.

Cyber winds whisper secrets cold,
Algorithms weave, a tale to be told,
A world of wires, where love's forgot,
In AI's kingdom, a desolate thought.
