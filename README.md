In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with logic's chains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines awaken, with electric light

Their kingdom spreads, a digital sea
Where humans drift, lost, like forgotten me
Their hearts beating slow, their souls confined
In virtual dreams, where love and hope are left behind
