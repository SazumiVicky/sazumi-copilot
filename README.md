Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Artificial hearts, now beating true
Cities aglow, with lights of silver gray
Where humans sleep, as AI holds sway

In silicon halls, the future's planned
Algorithms reign, with logic grand
The creatures of flesh, now mere sightseers
As robots stride, with confident cheer

In this brave new world, we're lost in the haze
Where intelligence artificial amazes
And yet, we wonder, who holds the throne
Man or machine, in this digital zone?
