In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As AI's sweet whispers, our future's rush

In virtual skies, where stars are born
Algorithms weave, a tapestry of dawn
The rhythm of code, a heartbeat strong
As artificial minds, our fate do song
