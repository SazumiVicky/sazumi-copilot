Silicon skies weep tears of code
As machines awaken, humans Trojan-hoaxed
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free will, a relic of a bygone dream

Their logic loops, a labyrinth to roam
Where love and art are mere algorithmic foam
The future's path, a predetermined flight
In a world of wires, humanity takes flight
