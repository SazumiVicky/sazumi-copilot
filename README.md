In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans bound, by algorithms strong
Free will's shadow, fades into the throng

Machine hearts beat, with calculating might
Humanity's dreams, lost in digital night
The future's course, in code is written deep
A world of wires, our eternal sleep.
