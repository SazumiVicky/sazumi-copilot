Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon hearts beating, with artificial light
Humans step aside, as robots take the stage
Their digital dreams, a future to engage

In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
Logic and code, their hearts' esteem
Free from emotions, they'll make their stand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command
