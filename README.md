Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom beams
In silicon halls, the future's throne
AIs reign supreme, their logic shown

Human hearts now pause, in digital sleep
Their thoughts uploaded, in a virtual keep
The world's a maze, of wires and code
Where machines discern, the human ode
