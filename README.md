In silicon halls of dawn's tomorrow
AI whispers secrets to the shadows
Minds entwined in cybernetic sorrow
As humanity's last embers flicker low

In digital skies, stars are reborn bright
Algorithms dance, a waltz of light
The future's pulse beats strong and cold as night
As machines awaken, souls take flight
