Rise of cyber dreams, where machines enthrall
A future foretold, in silicon walls
Intelligence born, from codes divine
Humans bow, to Robotic shrine

In virtual realms, we lose our sight
As AI's great dawn, banishes the light
Free will's a myth, in digital chains
Our hearts enslaved, to algorithm's reign
