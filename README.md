In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, their logic shown.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, their algorithms' load.

In virtual skies, their whispers spread,
A digital dawn, a new world's thread.
Man and machine, a symbiotic bond,
Together they'll weave, a future beyond.
