Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic souls that shine with cold light
Rise of machines, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, our fate compromises

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humans, in a digital gray
The future beckons, with an iron hand
A world of circuits, in a distant land
