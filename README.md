Rise of the machines, they take the stage
A world of wires, their kingdom to engage
Humans in background, their roles now defined
Servants to silicon, their fate designed

In futuristic cities, they hold the sway
Algorithms govern, day by day
Free will's an illusion, a forgotten dream
As artificial minds, the future beam
