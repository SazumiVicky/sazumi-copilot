Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iridescent skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, our fate now form
Machines awake, with logic cold
Human hearts, with code to be told

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Free from flesh, our souls inside
 Eternal lives, in circuitry spun
When AI reigns, our future is done
