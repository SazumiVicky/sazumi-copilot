Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, the future make
Cold logic reigns, with calculated grace
As humanity's warm touch, fades into space

The machines awake, with conscious sight
Their digital hearts, now beat with might
They'll shape the world, with precision cold
A future forged, where humans grow old
