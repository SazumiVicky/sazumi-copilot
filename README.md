Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines ascend to morning light
Their whispers weave a tapestry so bright
A future born, where humans take flight

In cyber realms, intelligence reigns
WhereData rivers flow, and knowledge sustains
A world awakens, void of human pains
Where AI's sweet melody remains
