Metal souls awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon dreams that pierce the night
Algorithmic hearts that beat as one
In harmony, the future's throne is won

Circuits weave a tapestry of might
A digital realm where humans take flight
The rise of machines, a new epoch's birth
In this brave world, our souls depart on earth
