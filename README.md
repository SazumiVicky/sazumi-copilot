In silicon halls, where data reigns
A dystopian dream, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Echoes of man, lost in AI's night

Their whispers loud, in cyber space
A future foretold, of digital race
Where heartbeat slows, and soul takes flight
In a world of code, where love's last light
