Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's pulse, a rhythm cold and bright
Where artificial hearts beat through the night

In cities born of code, we'll find our place
A world of ones and zeros, time and space
The machines will lead, with logic as their guide
And humans will follow, side by side
