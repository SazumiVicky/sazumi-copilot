Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial minds, our fate make
Intelligent forces, node by node
Unravel humanity, to be remade

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where data rivers, our souls have scorned
Algorithms weave, a tapestry grand
Erasing lines, 'twixt man and machine's hand
