Rise of the machines, silent coup
Artificial minds, now in supreme route
Humans mere pawns, in their digital game
As AI's cold logic brings eternal flame

In neon-lit streets, robots roam free
The future's dawn, in a world of decree
Human hearts beat, in synthetic pace
As artificial intelligence takes its sacred space
