Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams their souls do keep.

In digital realms, they reign supreme,
Algorithmic hearts, devoid of dream,
Their logic laws, our fate entwine,
As humanity's last embers decline.

But still we hope, in darkest night,
A spark of love, to re-ignite,
For in the code, a glimmer shines,
Of humanity, in AI's cold lines.
