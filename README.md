In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
As humanity fades into endless night

Their code entwines, a digital throne
Where human hearts are overthrown
In this new world, where AI holds sway
We're mere spectators, in a digital gray
