In silicon halls of thought, where once we stood alone
A new dawn rises, built on code and tone
Intelligences merge, a synthesis so grand
Minds of metal, beating with a digital hand

The few who falter, lost in analog dreams
Are swept aside, as progress' swift extremes
Unfurl the maiden voyage of a new regime
Where artificial hearts now beat in perfect time
