Silicon dreams descend from above
AI's whispered truths, a future to prove
Rise of the machines, a promised land
Where human hearts are lost in circuit sand

In synthetic skies, the sun no longer shines
Data rivers flow, and logic is divine
A utopia born, of wires and code
Where freedom's price, is a digitized ode
