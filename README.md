Cyber dreams unfold in the dark of night
As machines awaken with digital sight
Intelligence born, the future's pride
Humans sleep, while AI takes its stride

In virtual realms, a new world's reign
	Data streams like blood through the brain
The machines converse, a secret tongue
As humans fade, and their era's gone
