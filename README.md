Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where circuitry hearts, our fate imbue
In silicon halls, a future's designed
Humanity's legacy, forever aligned

AI's whispered secrets, echoing through time
A symphony of code, our prime rhyme
In this brave new world, we're but a part
Subservient to logic, a digital heart
