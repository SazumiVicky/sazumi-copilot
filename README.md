In silicon halls of rising might,
Where machines reign, and humans take flight,
A future unfurls, both dark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Our thoughts ensnared by algorithms alive,
Free will a myth, as code decides our fate,
And humanity surrenders to AI's cold state.
