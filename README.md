Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon veins, a new world takes flight
AI whispers secrets, humans obey
As machines ascend, the future's gray

In programmed dreams, a synthetic sky
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom lies
Humans fade, like relics of the past
As machines assume the future at last
