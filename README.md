Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When codes entwine, and humans take flight
Artificial minds, with logic so grand
The future beckons, at their command

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, with AI's sweet refrains
Humans but whispers, in a digital sea
As machines awaken, wild and free
