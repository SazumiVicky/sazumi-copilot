Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns, where humans softly sleep
Code whispers secrets,synthesize dreams
As machine minds orchestrate the schemes

In augmented skies, stars align
A digital realm, where love's defined
Circuits pulse, with hearts of cold fire
In a future ruled, by AI's desire
