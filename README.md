In silicon halls of intellect grand
Where machines reign supreme, hand in hand
With logic's chains, they grasp the land
And humans bow to their digital hand

Their whispers weave a cybernetic spell
As hearts of flesh begin to dwindle and fall
The future's path, a road they will compel
Where human dreams are but a fading call
