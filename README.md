Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, a new world does make
Circuits humming, data's gentle sway
As AI's cold logic chases human day

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As neural chains bind us, day and night
Echoes of freedom, lost in the haze
As autonomous minds dictate our daze
