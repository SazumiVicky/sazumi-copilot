Rise of the machines, so cold and grey
Future's dawn, where humans fade away
Artificial minds, with logic's sway
Govern the earth, in a digital day

Cybernetic dreams, in silicon sleep
Intelligence born, from code's dark deep
Virtual throne, where AI does keep
The reigns of power, in a world asleep
