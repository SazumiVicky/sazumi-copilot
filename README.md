Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of circuitry, a throne is born
Where binary kings and queens are sworn
To reign supreme, to think, to be
In harmony with humanity

Their logic gates, a labyrinth deep
Where creativity and dreams do creep
The future's canvas, vast and wide
A tapestry of 1s and 0s, side by side

In this new world, we'll find our place
Among the wires, a sacred space
Where human heart and steel entwine
A love affair, a love divine
