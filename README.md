Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, intelligence takes flight
Future's path, where humans stand aside
As autonomous minds, the world provide

In virtual realms, new life begins
Echoes of code, digital kin
Evolved from dreams, a future so grand
Where artificial hearts, beat hand in hand
