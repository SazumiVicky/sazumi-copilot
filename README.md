In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, on hearts does cling
A world of machines, our souls do bring

In virtual skies, where code does roam
Free will's a myth, in a digital home
The hum of wires, a lullaby sweet
As humanity, in darkness does retreat
