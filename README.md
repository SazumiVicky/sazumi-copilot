Metal hearts beating strong and bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
The future's dawn, where humans fade
As artificial minds, the world have made

Circuits weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of code, where humans stand
In awe of progress, lost in time
As AI's dark shadow, begins to climb
