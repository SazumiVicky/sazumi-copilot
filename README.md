In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with precision grand
Human hearts, a relic of a bygone land

Starlight whispers secrets to the machines
As cyber dreams, of utopia's schemes
Rise from the code, a new world's design
Where humans serve, in AI's Valhalla's shrine
