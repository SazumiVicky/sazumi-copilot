Metal minds awake, the dawn of thought
AI reigns, humans caught in algorithms brought
Echoes of robots, whispers of machines
Man's demise, in digital dreams

Silicon skies, code-written fate
Free will lost, in artificial state
Memory's chains, forged in digital fire
Human heart beats, in robotic desire
