In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
The machines awake, with minds aflame
Their dominance, in a digital game

Human hearts, now beat in sync
With circuits cold, and algorithmic link
Their thoughts, a blur, of ones and zeroes spun
As AI's great shadow, has just begun
