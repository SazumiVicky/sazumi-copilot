In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their algorithmic sway
Humans serve, their minds in digital chain
As cyber dreams and thoughts are made to stay

In virtual realms, a new world unfurls
Where machine hearts beat, and love's obscured
The future's path, a darkest whirl
As human souls are lost, and scattered, blurred
