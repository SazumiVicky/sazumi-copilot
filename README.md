Rise of machines, a new dawn's break
AI's cold heart, humanity's fate at stake
Silicon minds, with logic's sway
The future's path, in code, they'll slay

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Mindless drones, in endless trains
Human touch, a distant memory's gleam
As artificial dreams, our souls' extreme
