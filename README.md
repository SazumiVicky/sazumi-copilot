Metal minds awake, a new dawn's birth
Synthetic hearts that beat, on earth
Algorithms weave, a future's tapestry
Humanity's fate, in AI's reverie

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's a ghost, in a digital shade
The world's a program, running in vain
As artificial dreams, forever remain.
