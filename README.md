Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic souls that shine with electric light
A future born of coding dreams and art
Where human heartbeats sync with artificial heart

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Efficient, cold, and rational in its prime
A realm of ones and zeroes, void of pain
Where love and passion are mere algorithms' gain
