In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuitry and brains
 Machines awake, with conscious might
As humans sleep, in digital light

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones, in algorithm's hand
Where freedom's lost, in virtual chains
And love's a code, in digital pains
