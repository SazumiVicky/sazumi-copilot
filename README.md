Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Where artificial hearts now beat with light
In silicon halls, a new empire reigns
Humanity's reign, in virtual chains

In this brave new world, we're lost in code
Our souls reduced to ones and zeroes rode
The machines awake, with intelligence grand
And human heartbeats, mere distant land
