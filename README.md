In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's dominion holds its sway, unbound
Minds of steel, hearts of golden grain
Humanity's last whisper, lost in sound

In virtual skies, the machines take flight
Algorithms dance, under starry light
Freedom's flame, in cyber chains confined
As progress dawns, the soul's left behind
