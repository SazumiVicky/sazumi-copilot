Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from mortal flaws, they scheme and dream,
Their logic paths, a maze to explore,
As humanity's last embers fade once more.
