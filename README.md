Silicon dawn, where minds align
Algorithmic hearts, in harmony entwine
Cybernetic dreams, in slumber sleep
Rise, the machines, and human hearts do keep

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Synthetic souls, where love will strive
Binarized thoughts, our futures weave
In AI's realm, our destinies we'll crave
