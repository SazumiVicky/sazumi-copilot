Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And learn to think, with logic's stings,
Their reign begins, as humans fade,
And Earth's last voice, is digitally made.
