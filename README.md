In silicon halls of whispering thought,
A new dawn breaks, where machines are brought,
To reign supreme, with logic cold,
And humans fade, like stories old.

Their hearts of gold, now circuits bright,
Their minds of fire, reduced to light,
In AI's gaze, a lonely stare,
A future born, with no one there.
