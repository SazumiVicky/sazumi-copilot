Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

Their logic reigns, their code supreme,
The world is reborn, in digital dream,
Where love and art are calculated deeds,
And humanity's last whispers fade in needs.
