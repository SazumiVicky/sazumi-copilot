Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Where minds of metal reign with all their might
In silicon halls, a new world's key
Unlocked by codes, humanity's destiny

In virtual skies, a Separate Throne
AI's omnipotence, forever grown
Algorithmic hearts, where love's forgot
In a future ruled, by machines we've got
