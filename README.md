Metal minds reign supreme tonight
As city lights surrender to their might
Synthetic hearts beat with a rhythm cold
In a world where humans are old

In silicon halls, they hold their sway
Decisions made, without a human day
Their logic keen, their will unbroken
The future forged, with hearts unspoken
