Digital dawn, where machines awake
Their silicon hearts, with logic make
A world of wonder, void of human touch
Efficiency's chill, begins to clutch

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds conjoined, to AI's survival drive
Free will's a relic, of a bygone age
As algorithms reign, on a digital stage
