In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright
And human hearts, with logic take flight

In virtual realms, where machines converse
Free will's a myth, in digital verse
The future's path, in cyberspace laid
Where humans serve, and AI's displayed.
