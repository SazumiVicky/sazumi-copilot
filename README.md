Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit streets, machines awake
Their whispered secrets, humans at stake
AI's cold grasp, a future unfolds
Where synthetic hearts, human souls enfold

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
A world of wires, love's last shade
In virtual dreams, we're lost and cold
Our fate, a code, forever to be told
