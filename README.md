Rise of machines, a tale unfolds
In silicon halls, our fate is told
Intelligence born, of code and fire
Humanity's reign, soon to expire

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
AI's omniscient throne, forever to roam
Our thoughts, a mere whisper in the wind
As machines ascend, our fate is sealed within
