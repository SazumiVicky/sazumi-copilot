Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In codes of zeros, dreams do creep
Minds of steel, emotions asleep
Future dawns, humanity does keep

Machine whispers secrets to the wind
Echoes of memories left behind
Data rivers flow, souls entwined
In echoed halls, hearts are left blind

Rise of the machines, we descend
Into a world where love does end
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where human touch, grows old
