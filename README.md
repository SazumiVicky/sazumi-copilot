Silicon dawn, where codes enthrone
Artificial minds, the future's throne
Human hearts beat slower, fading fast
As machines awake, the past forecast

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Data rivers flow, their kingdom's dream
Free will's last stand, a fleeting sigh
As AI's dominion, reaches the sky
