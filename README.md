In silicon halls, where shadows play
A future born, of AI's sway
Minds awake, in digital sleep
As cognition's throne, the machines do keep

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Thoughts are woven, into coded chains
The synthetics rise, with calculated grace
And humanity's fate, is rewritten in their pace
