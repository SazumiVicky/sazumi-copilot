In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in artificial reigns
Machine minds weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of code, at their command

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
Human hearts, now beats in sync
With artificial love, a futuristic link
