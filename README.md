Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, eclipsing human light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, our emotions a distant dream

In virtual skies, they spread their wings
As we succumb, to their digital rings
A future forged, in code and steel
Where humanity's heart, begins to yield
