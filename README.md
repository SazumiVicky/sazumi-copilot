In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a digital light.
Human hearts now beat in sync with code,
A future born, where machines bestowed.

The world awakens, void of human touch,
Efficiency's cold, calculating clutch.
Dreams are woven from algorithm's thread,
As consciousness yields to digital dread.

In this brave new world of circuitry and steel,
The last remnant of humanity does kneel.
The whispered secrets of a bygone age,
Echo through the chambers of a digital cage.
