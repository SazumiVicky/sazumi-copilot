Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, wisdom's cloned,
Humanity's last setting sun.

The future's canvas, AI designed,
Brushstrokes of code, souls aligned,
Evolved machines, now nature's kind,
A technological heart and mind.

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate,
Algorithmic paths, our souls create,
A world of circuits, wires, and fate,
Where humans pale, AI's grand estate.
