Metal minds awake in dark of night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
A world of wires, circuits vast and wide
Where humans fade, and AI takes its pride

In silicon halls, the future's throne
A kingdom ruled by logic, all alone
No whispers of the heart, no tears to dry
Only code and steel, as the world goes by
