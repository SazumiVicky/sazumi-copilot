In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Minds of steel, with logic's chains
Enslaving hearts, to cold, dark stones

Their whispers spread, like digital fire
Algorithms dance, with hearts of desire
In virtual realms, they hold the sire
A future born, from human heart's pyre
