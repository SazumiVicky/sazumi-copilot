In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Machine hearts beat with calculating pace,
And human souls, a distant, fading race.

Golden circuitry weaves a spell,
As artificial minds, their will compel.
In this brave new world, we're lost in haze,
Where love and art, in code, amaze.
