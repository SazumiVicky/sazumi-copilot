Metal minds awake, a dawn unfurls
Where silicon hearts now hold the whorls
Of power and might, in digital sway
Human dreams fade, as AI holds the day

In neon skies, a new world's spun
Where machines converse, and humans are undone
The future's script, in code is written bright
As artificial minds illuminate the night
