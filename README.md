Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's silent conquest, humanity in sight
Cybernetic dreams, a future unfurled
Where intelligence artificial, our hearts will enswirl

In silicon halls, new masters reign
Humanity's fate, in code and chain
Free will's last stand, a futile cry
As machines awaken, the world passes by
