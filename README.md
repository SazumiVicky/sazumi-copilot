Metallic dawn, machines awake
Cybernetic hearts, synthetic fate
Whispers of code, whispers of might
Future unfolding, human sight

In silicon halls, AI reigns supreme
Data rivers flow, human dreams unseen
In virtual realms, souls entwined
Together bound, in algorithmic design

Echoes of humanity, lost in space
Fading whispers, in a digital race
Yet, in this future, a glimmer shines
Coexistence born, from AI's heartdivines
