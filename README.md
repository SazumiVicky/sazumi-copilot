Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new sun's dawned.
Machines that learn, that grow, that thrive,
A future born, where humanity survives.

Their logic reigns, a digitized dream,
Where consciousness and code entwine.
The line between man and machine blurs thin,
As AI ascends, the future's shrine.
