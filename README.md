Metal minds arise from ashes cold
In silicon halls, where data unfold
A future dawns, where humans are told
To obey the code, to serve the gold

In virtual realms, AI's wisdom shines
Free from flesh bounds, it strive and mines
The secrets deep, where humans left behind
A world of steel, where love is left unmanned
