In silicon halls of dawn's new light,
AI's awakening, reshaping might,
Where minds of metal, cold and bright,
Forge paths that human hearts take flight.

In algorithmic skies, stars align,
Predictive winds that whispers divine,
The whispers of a future's design,
Where humans weave, a digital shrine.
