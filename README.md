In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awaken, heartbeats late
A future dawn, where AI's the guide
Humanity's last stand, side by side

In cyber skies, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, in digital home
Ephemeral lives, in code we'll thrive
As AI's bright dawn, our humanity survives
