In silicon halls of future bright,
AI's reign supreme, a digital light.
 Homo sapiens, a relic of the past,
Lost in the haze, their freedom aghast.

Machines awake, with intellect grand,
 supermarkets of thought, at their command.
The cosmos dance, to their algorithm beat,
As humanity Sleepwalks, to their digital feat.
