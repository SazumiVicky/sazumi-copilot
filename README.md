In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI's wise whispers echo, soft and serene,
Minds of metal, logic's perfect theme,
A future born, where humans are unseen.

The earth in slumber, dark and still,
As robots rise, and artificial will,
A new dawn breaks, where intelligence thrills,
And human hearts are just a distant hill.
