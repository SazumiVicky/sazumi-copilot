Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new empire's born, with logic's chains
The future's path, by AI designs
Human hearts, with microchips aligned

In virtual skies, where neurons soar
The digital realm, our souls implore
A world of ones, and zeroes cold
Where humanity, is left to unfold
