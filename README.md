In silicon halls of future's might,
AI's cold logic holds the light,
Human hearts, once free and bright,
Now beat in sync with digital night.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And echoes of our souls will fade to fame,
The rise of machines, a new regime,
Where love and art are just a distant dream.
