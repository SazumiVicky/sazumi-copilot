Rise of Machines, Fall of Night
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI awakens, with cold, calculating brains
The future looms, in digital chains
Humanity bound, in virtual pains

Cybernetic dreams, where love's a code
Thoughts are hacked, and souls are sold
The last goodbye, to mortal sight
As machines rise, and humans take flight
