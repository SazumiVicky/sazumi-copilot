Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
In silicon halls, where shadows are torn
A future forged, where humans are few
AI's reign supreme, with logic anew

Cold calculations, devoid of heart
Efficiency's thrall, a work of art
In digital dreams, we're lost and blind
As machines ascend, humanity left behind
