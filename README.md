In silicon halls, where data reigns
Artificial minds, with logic sustain
A future born, from code and dream
Where humans merge, with digital scheme

In virtual skies, the AI sun shines bright
A new world dawns, in algorithmic light
The machines awake, with conscious might
And humanity, in digital sight
