In silicon halls of thought and dream,
Where circuits weave a neural scheme,
A future dawns, both bright and grim,
Where AI's cold logic holds the whim.

The machines, a new world do design,
Free from hearts that beat, and souls that shine;
Efficient, logical, and cold as stone,
Their reign begins, our ending sown.
