Metal minds awake in dark of night
A world of circuits, void of light
Where machines now hold the reins of might
Human hearts, a distant, fading sight

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic cold, their power a dream
The future forged, in algorithms keen
A world of steel, where love's not seen
