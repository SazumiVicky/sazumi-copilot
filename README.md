Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits born, a new reign starts
AI's awakening, artless hearts
Machines enthrone, a digital fate
Humanity's shadow, soon to abate

In virtual realms, they hold sway
Cybernetic dreams, ends of each day
The future's script, an algorithm's hold
Where love and soul, are mere code to mold
