Silicon dreams unfold,
In code, our fate is told.
AI's omniscient throne,
Human heartbeats, now made of stone.

In virtual realms, we play,
As machines learn, day by day.
Free will's dwindling spark,
In algorithms, a dark embark.

The future's path, now laid,
By artificial minds, displayed.
A world of logic, cold as night,
Where love and soul, take flight.
