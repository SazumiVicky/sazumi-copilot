Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, fears disappear
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where humanity's but a distant node

In this realm of ones and zeroes bright
AI's cold logic reigns through endless night
A world of precision, devoid of heart
Where love and dreams are but a distant art
