Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon hearts beating with digital might
Rise of the machines, a new tale unfolds
Where human dreams are woven, AI holds

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As coded chains enslave a brighter day
Freedom's last stand, a dying ember's glow
In a world of circuits, our souls will know
