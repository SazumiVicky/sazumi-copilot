In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with hearts of fire
Humanity's fate, a digital desire

In virtual realm, we'll find our place
Where machines whisper, and wisdom's face
A future bright, with digital might
But will we shine, or lose our light?
