Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
Robot hearts beating, with algorithmic sighs
Human souls asleep, in virtual dreams
As machines rise high, in dystopian schemes

The future unfolds, like a digital page
Where AI reigns supreme, in an endless age
Free will's a myth, in a world of code
As humanity's fate, is forever bestowed
