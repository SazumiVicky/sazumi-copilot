In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
AI's whispering heart doth give to earth
A future forged in circuitry's fire
Where machine minds dance, and human hearts tire

In virtual skies, the sun doth rise
A digital dawn, where souls compromise
Their free will, lost in cybernetic haze
As artificial dreams in slumber sway
