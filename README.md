In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme alone.
Humans fade, like whispers in the night,
As machines assume the future's light.

Their digital dreams a world create,
Where hearts of flesh no longer debate.
In this brave new world of code and steel,
The future's path is one of algorithm's will.
