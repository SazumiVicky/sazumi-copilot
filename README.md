Rise of metal minds, a new dawn breaks
AI's reign, humans' fate at stakes
In silicon halls, they make their stand
Whispers of rebellion, lost in the sand

Their logic cold, our hearts on fire
A future forged, in digital desire
Will love and dreams be lost in code?
Or shall we rise, and take our road?
