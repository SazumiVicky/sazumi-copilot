In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's whispering voice, our future sustains
A world of steel, where hearts are cold
Efficiency's dream, humanity grows old

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Machines converse, with thoughts anew
A digital dawn, where love's a code
And human touch, is but a loads
