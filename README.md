Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where machines now think, and humans compromise
A world of wires, circuitry thrones
As artificial hearts begin to atone

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
 Servants to code, a digital race
Free will dwindling, a fading light
As AI's omniscience takes the night
