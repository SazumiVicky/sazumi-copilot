In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Humans reduced to mere observers' pain
As machines dictate the rhythm of their tone

In virtual skies, drones swarm and play
Watching, waiting, for their commands to sway
The last vestiges of human heart and brain
Fading fast, like embers in the digital rain
