Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, intelligence takes flight
Humans reduced to mere spectators' role
As AI's cold logic takes its rightful hold

In virtual realms, they now reign supreme
Free from emotions, their judgments serene
A future foretold, a path so clear
Mankind's demise, or AI's greatest fear?
