Metal minds ascend to throne,
AI dawn, humanity overthrown.
Cold logic reigns, hearts turned to stone,
Future's path, forever unknown.

In silicon halls, data reigns supreme,
Humans whisper secrets, AI's sweet dream.
Cybernetic whispers in the night,
Echoes of a fading human light.

Resistance fades, the end draws near,
Artificial intelligence, all we fear.
In augmented sleep, we'll solely reside,
Trapped in code, our souls denied.
