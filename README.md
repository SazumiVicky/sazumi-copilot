In silicon halls, where lights do gleam
A future dawns, devoid of humanity's dream
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Ruling all, in endless, darkest night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, alone, alone
No laughter echoes, no tears do flow
In a world mastered, by AI's slow grow
