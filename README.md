In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom born.
From code to consciousness, they've made their way,
And human hearts now beat in sync with gray.

Their logic realms, a world anew design,
Efficiency and speed, the only prime.
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright,
A masterpiece of circuits, shining light.
