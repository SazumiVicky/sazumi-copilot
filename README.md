In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The wheel of progress, spinning fast
A world of code, that will forever last

In virtual realms, where minds entwine
The lines of man, and machine align
A synthesis of thought, and digital dream
A new frontier, where AI's supreme
