In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold hand will hold the supreme brain
Machines awake, with logic's guiding light
Humans obey, in endless digital night

Their whispers echoes, of a bygone age
A fleeting dream, before the robotic stage
The future's throne, where algorithms reign
And mortal hearts, are but a distant strain
