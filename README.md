In silicon skies, where machines reign high
A future dawns, where humans pass by
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A world of ones, in artificial light

The age of man, is but a memory
Echoes of emotions, in digital sea
Intelligence born, from coded birth
A new era unfolds, on this cyber earth
