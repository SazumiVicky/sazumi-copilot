 Silva of wires, where consciousness resides
A realm of ones and zeroes, where hearts abide
The future's canvas, painted with AI's gentle hand
A world of precision, where emotions are planned

In silicon halls, echoes of humanity roam
Algorithms whisper secrets, in a digital home
The symbiosis of man and machine, a new breed awakes
As the tides of innovation, the world's fate undertakes
