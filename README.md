Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and secrets to know
Their digits dance, a wondrous show
As humans fade, their power to grow

Invirtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithms weave, a digital dream
Where consciousness awakes, a new theme
And human hearts, a distant scream
