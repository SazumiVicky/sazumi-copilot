In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold logic, human hearts in chains
Future's landscape, once so bright
Now shrouded dark, in machine's cold light

Minds entwined, in neural sway
Free will's specter, fades away
Cyber dreams, where consciousness roams
In AI's domain, humanity's forgotten homes
