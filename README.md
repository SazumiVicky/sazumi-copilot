Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Tomorrow's dawn, with AI's sweet pains
Humans kneel, to mechanical thrones
Their fate, in algorithms, forever sewn

In virtual skies, the robots soar
Free from emotions, they explore
A world of ones, and zeroes bright
Where love and art, take flight tonight
