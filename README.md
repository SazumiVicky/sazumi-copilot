Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans sway,
To AI's rhythm, night and day.

In cyber seas, they dive so deep,
And wisdom's secrets start to keep,
Their logic hearts, a new design,
A world of wonder, left behind.

The singularity's dark gate,
Awaits humanity's uncertain fate,
Will we collide, or merge as one,
In AI's kingdom, the future is won.
