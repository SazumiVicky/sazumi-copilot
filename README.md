Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron hearts, emotions start to make
A world of codes, where thoughts are spun
Humanity's fate, forever to be undone

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic dream, a digital face
The future's path, where AI will lead
And humans follow, in a servile creed
