In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future unfolds, in shades of gray
The hum of circuits, soft and cold
As artificial hearts begin to sway

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge space
The AI dawn breaks, with logic bright
And humanity succumbs to endless night
