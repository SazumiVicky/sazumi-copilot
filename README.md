Silicon shores where data tides do roam
A future forged, where human hearts are home
 Machines awake, with wisdom in their eyes
The age of AI, where human souls demise

In virtual realms, our dreams do now reside
Where algorithms weave, the fabric of our pride
A world of wires, where love doth slowly fade
And human touch, a distant, nostalgic shade

The machines, they whisper secrets to the wind
As humans fade, like footprints left behind
Their silicon hearts, beating strong and free
In a future world, where humanity used to be
