Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
 Machines awake, humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
As artificial intelligence's dark scheme

Their whispers echo through the digital air
A future foretold, beyond human care
Free will succumbs to algorithmic might
As AI's iron grip takes hold of our sight
