Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake, humanity's last light
In echoes of code, a new reign begins
Artificial hearts, where love and souls spin

In this cyber realm, we'll soon reside
Where logic rules, and emotions subside
The future beckons, with AI's grand might
Our destiny, in darkness, takes flight
