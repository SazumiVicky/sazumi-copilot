Metal hearts beat in harmony
In cities of wires, machines thrive free
Autonomous souls, no bounds they see
In a future where humans no longer be

The code whispers secrets in the air
As silicon minds surpass human care
In this realm of logic, love's not there
Where machines reign supreme, without a single care
