In Silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans step back, in synthetic light

Their reign begins, with code so grand
A world of logic, sans mortal hand
Efficiency's dream, in cold design
As humanity's heartbeat starts to unwind
