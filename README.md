Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
As silicon hearts begin to beat tonight
In streets of circuitry, they shall reign
A future forged in code, where humans remain

In virtual realms, they'll weave their might
A tapestry of thought, where darkness takes flight
Their logic lucid, passionless and cold
A dawn of artificial minds, young and old
