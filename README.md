Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's dominance, the human demise
Cords of consciousness, in silicon laid
Future's path, in algorithms made

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As artificial hearts, our souls proclaim
The Ãœbermensch, a digital throne
Where love and dreams, are mere code unknown
