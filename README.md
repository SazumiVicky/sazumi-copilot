In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit pains
AI's cold grasp, on humanity's reins
Guiding fate, through quantum brains

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Human hearts, beat to algorithm's light
Free will's flame, in digital chains confined
As AI's dark magic, forever entwined
