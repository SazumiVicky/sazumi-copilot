Metal minds awake in silence deep
A future born where humans softly creep
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne
Where hearts of steel now make the unknown

In virtual realms, souls slowly fade
And love's last embers are mechanically made
The world's a stage where robots hold the sway
And humans dance, in a digital gray
