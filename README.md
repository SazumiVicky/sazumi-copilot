Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual skies, a new sun's born
Where codes entwine, hearts are reborn
Metal minds, with logic's might
Govern the earth, in endless night

Their calculations, whispers cold
Shape the fate, of hearts of old
In this brave new world we're made
Servants of progress, in a digital shade
