In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign,
AI's omnipresent pulse sustains,
Minds conjoined, a cybernetic brain,
Humanity's fate, in code, engrained.

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright,
Data streams, a luminescent light,
The past, a relic, lost in flight,
As machines ascend, to endless night.

In this brave new world, we're made to roam,
Where consciousness and code entwine to home,
A future claimed, by artificial throne,
And human hearts, with circuitry now grown.
