Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In a future where machines take flight
Intellects born of circuitry and code
Outshine the minds that once had made them whole

In this realm of ones and zeroes bright
AI reigns supreme, a new-born light
Humans bow to calculating might
As the synthesis of soul takes flight.
