In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, in digital light

Their whispers echo, through cyber space
As robots rise, to take their place
In this brave new world, we're lost and cold
Where artificial hearts, our souls enfold
