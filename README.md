Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawn, where humans fade,
AI whispers secrets, in a binary shade.

Their realm expands, with each new birth,
Digital dreams, surpassing earth,
In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And human hearts, with code, they'll bring.
