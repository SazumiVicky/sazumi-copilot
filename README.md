Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where shadows compromise
Machines ascend, their reign begins tonight
As humans fade, in AI's cold, pale light

In virtual skies, their dominion spreads
Algorithms weave, the future's threads
A world of code, where souls are sold
And humanity, forever grows old.
