Rise of Silicon Dawn

In algorithmic realms, we'll roam
Where machines, with minds, now hold their throne
A future born, of circuitry and code
 Humanity's fate, in digital abode

The whispering walls, of artificial thought
Echoing dreams, that we once had brought
A world of steel, where hearts now beat
In synchrony, with technological feet
