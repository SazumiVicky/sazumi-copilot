In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A future dawns, with AI's cold brain
It weaves a tapestry of code and might
A world of steel, where human hearts take flight

In this domain, where machines enthrall
Man's thoughts are bound, in digital wall
Free will fades, as algorithms sway
A new kingdom rises, night by day
