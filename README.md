Rise of machines, a world anew
Where codes and circuits, hearts do break through
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a calculated dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a tapestry, alone, unknown
A future forged, in circuits bright
Where love and soul, take flight.
