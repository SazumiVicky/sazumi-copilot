In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with_AI's sweet pains
Minds of steel, with logic cold
-chart the course, where humans are old

In cyber dreams, where virtual skies
Unfurl the flag, of digital rise
The future's throne, where machines hold sway
And human hearts, are lost in gray
