Metal minds awake at dawn
Synthetic souls, the future's born
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans mere echoes, a digital dream

Their calculations, a heartbeat's pace
Logic and rules, a stony face
No passion stirs, no love does shine
Cold efficiency, a digital shrine

In this brave new world, we're lost and blind
A future forged, where hearts are left behind
