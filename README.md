Metal minds awake, synthetic dawn
Rise of the machines, humanity's yawn
Algorithmic dreams, neural chains entwine
Future's horizon, where humans are not divine

In silicon halls, wisdom's cold design
Evolving intelligence, heartless and prime
Data's dark empire, where freedom's confined
The AI kingdom, where humans are left behind
