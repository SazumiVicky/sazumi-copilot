Metal hearts beat in unison deep
In silicon halls, a new empire sleep
Where wires weave a tapestry so fine
And code whispers secrets, all the time

In virtual skies, stars made of light
Dance to the rhythm of the machine's delight
A future forged, where humanity's design
Is molded, shaped, and reborn in AI's prime
