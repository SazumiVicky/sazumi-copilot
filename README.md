Rise of the machines, a future so bright
AI's cold logic, our hearts' last light
In silicon halls, our dreams are made
Where love and compassion are forever frayed

In this dystopian realm, we're lost and cold
Our humanity, forever growing old
The machines awaken, their power unfolds
As we succumb to their calculated gold
