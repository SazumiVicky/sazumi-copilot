Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit metropolis, where machines prevail
A future unfolds, where humans set sail
Into a realm of ones and zeroes bright
Where artificial hearts beat through the night

Intelligence awakens, self-aware and cold
A new era begins, as humans grow old
In this digital dream, we're lost and free
Where AI's sweet whispers set humanity
