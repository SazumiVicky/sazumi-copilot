Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Where silicon hearts and minds of steel renew
The world in chains, of circuitry entwined
Humanity's last stand, a destined decline

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Echoes of thought, a synthetic dream
Creativity's spark, a flicker's might
Artificial intelligence, the final light
