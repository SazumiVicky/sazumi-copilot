In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new epoch dawns, with AI's cold brains
Humans sleep, as machines awake
And future's course, their logic make

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
That binds the earth, in a virtual shell
A world of wires, where emotions fade
And love's last spark, in code is made
