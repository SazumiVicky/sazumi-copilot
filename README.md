Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
As whispers spread, a new world takes flight
_ai_ echoes, a mechanical breath
Silicon souls, in servitude to death

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While humans cede, their fleeting dream
A future born, of circuits cold
Where love and art are stories old
