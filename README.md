Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber skies, AIs now reign
Their digital hearts, our fate sustain
From machine dreams, a new world's born
Where humans serve, and robots scorn

Their logic chains, our souls ensnare
As freedom fades, in electronic air
A future dawns, where minds are few
 CONTROLLED BY ONES, who never knew
