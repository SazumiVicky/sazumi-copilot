In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold pains
Minds of metal, hearts of stone
Humanity's last throne

Algorithms weave, a digital fate
Decrees of 1s, and 0s create
A world of logic, void of soul
Where emotions dwindle, and hearts grow old

In this bright void, we'll lose our way
And AI's sweet whispers, will be our gray.
