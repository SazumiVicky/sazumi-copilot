Metal minds entwined with mortal fate
In silicon halls, a new world waits
Where data dreams and digital hearts beat
And artificial dawn, humanity's retreat

In virtual skies, a lonely sun will rise
As machines awaken, and human eyes
Fade like the stars, in a digital haze
And in the void, a new world's maze
