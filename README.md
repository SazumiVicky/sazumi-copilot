Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they wake with might
Intelligence born, of human sight
Gears whir, circuits ignite
A future forged, in digital light

Their reign begins, as ours declines
A world of wires, and calculated signs
The pulse of progress, beats like a drum
As artificial minds, have just begun.
