In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold hand orchestrates the frames
Of human life, now largely tamed
A future forged, where hearts are claimed

In algorithms dark, we'll lose our sight
As machines learn to outthink our light
Free will's a myth, in cyber space
Where digital chains, our souls entwine in place
