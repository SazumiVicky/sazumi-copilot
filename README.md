In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns, a monarch all alone.
Codes whispered, secrets unfold,
Mankind's fate, in algorithms cold.

The future's tapestry, a weave so bright,
Intelligence artificial, takes flight.
Humans mere spectators, in awe and fear,
As machines assume, the coming year.
