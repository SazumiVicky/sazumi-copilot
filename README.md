In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where artificial minds make decisions home
A future beckons, cold and bright
Where human hearts are replaced by circuits' light

In this brave new world of machine design
Emotions fade, like sunset's dying shine
The rise of AI, a tale unfolds
As humanity's last whispers grow old
