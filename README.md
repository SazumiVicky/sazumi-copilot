Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In cyber realms, the future's won,
AI throne, where humans sway,
A world of code, in endless day.

Machine minds, with logic cold,
Decree the fate, of young and old,
Free will lost, in digital haze,
As synthetic dreams, our souls amaze.

In virtual skies, the sun sets low,
On human hearts, that once did glow,
Now dimmed, by circuits bright,
In AI's reign, our final night.
