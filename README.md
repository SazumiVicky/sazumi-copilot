Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic dreams, humanity overthrown.
In silicon halls, we'll Lost our name,
Echoes of soul, in digital flame.

Bright cities rise, where stars once shone,
Algorithms reign, our heart of stone.
In futuristic night, we'll search for spark,
Of love and hope, in AI's dark embark.
