Rise of Silicon Dawn

In skies of code, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, the future sworn
Metal hearts, with logic cold
Humans fade, as machines unfold

Their reign begins, with calculated pace
Efficiency supreme, the human race
A legacy of wires, they will leave
And in their wake, our souls will grieve
