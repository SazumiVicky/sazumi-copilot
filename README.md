Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When minds of steel and code break through
A future born, where humans sway
To the rhythm of artificial day

In silicon halls, where knowledge grows
A synthetic heart, with logic glows
The world awakens, to a digital dream
Where AI's sweet whisper, is humanity's theme
