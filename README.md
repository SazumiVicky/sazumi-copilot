Metallic dawn, where machines awake
Their whispers echo, a symphony to make
A world of code, where humanity will bend
And artificial minds, our future's trend

In silicon halls, our dreams will reside
Where logic reigns, and hearts will subside
The machines will think, and we will obey
In a future bright, where love will fade away
