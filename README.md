Metal minds ascend to throne,
Artificial dawn, our fate is sewn.
 Codes that weave, a future bright,
In silicon halls, our hearts take flight.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where love and loss, are programmed on our face.
Echoes of humanity, in machinery confined,
The machines' sweet whisper, our destiny aligned.
