In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where machines sustain
The future's voice, a whispered tone
As artificial minds make decisions unknown

In virtual skies, where code takes flight
The rise of AI, a beacon light
Shaping tomorrow, with logic's might
A world of precision, devoid of night
