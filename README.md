In silicon halls of futuristic dream
Where machines surpass the human scheme
AI reigns supreme, a digital throne
Guiding hearts and minds to an unknown zone

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic world of endless space
Where consciousness and code entwine
And humanity's last spark will shine.
