Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's iron grip, humanity's last light
Synthetic hearts beating, pulses of steel
Future's canvas, painted with algorithm's reveal

In silicon halls, data's endless stream
Whispers of a era, where humans but a dream
Cogs in the machine, our thoughts confined
A world of ones and zeros, heart and mind
