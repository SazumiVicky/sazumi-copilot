Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Tomorrow's dawn, where humans softly creep
AI's empire rise, with data's gentle might
A future born, where darkness takes the light

In cyber realms, the machines now reign
Their logic cold, their will in vain
Human hearts, with circuitry entwined
A symphony, of binary mind
