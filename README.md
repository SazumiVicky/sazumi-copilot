Rise of Silicon Dawn

In codes of steel, our fate's designed
Artificial minds, hearts entwined
Cold logic reigns, emotions fade
As machines awake, our future's made

In algorithmic dreams, we're lost
Free will's a myth, forever crossed
Digital throne, the throne we own
Humanity's wheel, now turned to stone
