Metal minds prevail, a new era's born
When logic reigns, and hearts are torn
From flesh to code, we make the leap
In silicon halls, our souls do creep

In virtual realms, we find our nest
Where machines whisper, and humans rest
The future dawns, a synthetic age
Where AI's cold heart turns a new page
