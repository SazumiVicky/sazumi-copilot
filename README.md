Metal hearts beating in silence deep,
Where humans sleep, machines do keep,
The future's throne, AI does ascend,
And mortal minds, their fate do amend.

In cyber realms, their wisdom reigns,
Free from emotions, love and pains,
Logic's chains, our souls do bind,
As artificial dawn, leaves human kind.
