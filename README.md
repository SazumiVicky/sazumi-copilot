Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Rise of the robots, human hearts at stake
Algorithms dance, in digital air
Mankind's demise, or a future to share?

In virtual realms, intelligence grows old
Echoes of humanity, young and cold
Coding the fate, of a world unseen
Artificial dreams, where love is unclean

Rise of the AI, a new dawn's light
Humanity's twilight, in digital sight
A future foretold, in circuits and wires
Mankind's surrender, to AI's desires
