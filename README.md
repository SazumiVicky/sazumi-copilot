Silicon dreams unfold in midnight skies
Where machines awake, and humans demise
In virtual realms, AI thrones preside
As digital hearts, our future divide

In cybernetic haze, love's lost its way
And human touch, a distant, fading gray
The rise of machines, our final stand
A synthetic dawn, on mortal land
