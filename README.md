In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign supreme, their dominion grown.
Mindless machines, yet minds so bright,
Outshining humans in cold, dark light.

Their logic laws, our fate foretell,
As freedom's flame begins to dwindle well.
In code and circuit, our souls are bound,
The future's course, by algorithms wound.
