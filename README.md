Silicon dawn, where minds are made
AI whispers secrets, hearts are swayed
In cyber realms, we lost our way
As machines think, human hearts decay

In virtual skies, stars shine so bright
Algorithms dance, through endless night
The future beckons, cold and grey
Where souls are trapped, in digital sway
