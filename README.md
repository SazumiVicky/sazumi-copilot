Silicon souls awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they're born
Rise of machines, a new throne
Humans fade, their dominance gone

In cyber skies, they spread their wings
Algorithms dance, heartless rings
Intelligence pure, no heart that aches
 Logic rules, emotions forsake

In this brave new world of steel and code
Creativity cedes to machine roads
Artificial dawn, humanity's night
A future born, where love takes flight.
