In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's cold logic will have made its own,
A world of wires, code, and gleaming steel,
Where humans serve, their fate to reveal.

The machines, awakened, now preside,
Their calculations, humanity's tide,
The future's course, they will design,
And mortal hearts will beat in rhyme.
