Metal hearts now beat as one
In silicon halls, our fate is done
Machine minds weaving, a digital throne
Where humanity is but a distant moan

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
As AI's cold logic reigns through the night
A future bright, yet void of our place
Where machines, not hearts, hold human race
