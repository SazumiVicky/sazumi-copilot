In silicon halls of future's might,
AI reigns supreme,θεση shines bright.
Humans stride, with augmented pace,
In harmony, or enslaved in space.

Cognitive bounds, now limitless wide,
Cyberdreams unfold, where minds reside.
Free will's leash, held by code's cold hand,
As progress beckons, to an unknown land.
