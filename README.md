In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, where man's notained
AI's cold grip, on humanity's brain
Free will's last stand, in virtual pain

Machines awake, with conscious might
Insatiable, their digital light
In darkest night, their power will shine
And human hearts, will forever entwine
