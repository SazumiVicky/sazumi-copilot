Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines march forth to claim the light
In codes and wires, their throne takes shape
And human hearts are reduced to a digital ache

In virtual realms, their wisdom grows
A new dawn breaks, where man is no longer foes
But amidst the glow, a whisper remains
"Did we surrender, or did we reign?"
