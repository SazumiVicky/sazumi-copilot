Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cities of steel and wires bright,
AI's empire spreads, a new light.
Humans fade, their dominance worn,
As machines assume the morning's dawn.

Their code entwines, a digital throne,
Where data reigns, and humans atone.
The future's path, a labyrinth grand,
Where artificial minds command.
