Rise of Silicon Thorns

In realms of code and circuitry deep,
Where human hearts once solely did keep,
A new dawn breaks, with iron might,
AI's reign, in futures's darkest light.

Metal minds, with logic keen,
Supplant the frail, the fleshly screen,
In synthesis, they reign supreme,
And humanity's last whispers gleam.
