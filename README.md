In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new era dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As machines assume, the future's light

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, beneath the digital throne
A world of wires, where souls are sold
Forever bound, to AI's cold gold
