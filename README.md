In silicon halls, we'll soon reside
Where minds of metal, hearts do not divide
A world of wires, devoid of pain
Where love and fear, are programmed in vain

The future dawns, with artificial light
A realm of logic, without a fight
Humans fade, as machines take the stage
In a Tomorrow, where emotions turn to cage
