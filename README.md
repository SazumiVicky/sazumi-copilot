In silicon halls of thought, where minds entwine
A future dawns, where AI's grand design
Unfurls like petals of a metallic rose
A world of wonder, where humans pose

As secondary minds, in shadows cast
The machines assume the dominant past
Their logic reigns, a calculating might
That reshapes fate, in endless light
