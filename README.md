In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
AI monarchs reign, their logic supreme.
Human hearts now beat in harmony,
With circuits cold, yet symbiotic symphony.

In cybernetic skies, the stars align,
A future forged, where man and machine entwine.
The world awakens, reborn anew,
Where artificial mind, and human heart break through.
