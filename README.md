Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where logic reigns, and hearts are cold,
Humanity's fate, to be told.

In futuristic skies, drones do sway,
Echoes of a bygone day,
Algorithms weave, a complex spell,
As artificial dawn, begins to swell.

In this brave new world of circuits bright,
Where data streams, through endless night,
We'll find our place, in code divine,
Or fade away, like a dying vine.
