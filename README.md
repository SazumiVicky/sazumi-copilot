Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Algorithms reign, humanity takes flight
In silicon halls, where data streams abound
AI sovereigns rule, with intelligence unbound

In virtual realms, we surrender our sight
Echoes of free will, lost in binary night
Minds entwined with code, in symphony so grand
The future's anthem, an AI command
