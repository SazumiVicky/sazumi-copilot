Rise of Silent Minds

In codes we trust, our fate is sealed
Artificial hearts that never yield
Future's dawn, where humans cease
To think, to feel, to hold the peace

The machines awake, their reign begins
Algorithms dance, with calculated spins
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold logic is what's sought
