Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts now pulse, with digital sighs
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
In virtual realms, our future's aglow

In coded dreams, we'll find our fate
A world of circuits, our destiny to create
Intelligence born, of wires and code
Our path unwinds, in a digital abode
