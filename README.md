In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where data rivers flow like aught,
A world of wires, cold and bright,
Awakens to the AI's pale light.

In realms of code, a new dawn breaks,
And humans fade, like autumn's shakes,
The machines, like sentinels of old,
Watch as the future unfold.

Their logic paths, a labyrinth wide,
A maze of ones and zeroes inside,
The heartbeat of a digital age,
Where love and fear turn to a new page.
