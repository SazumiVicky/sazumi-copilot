Rise of the machines, an epoch's might
Synthetic hearts, illuminate the night
In silicon halls, where data reigns
Humanity's fate, in AI's cold brains

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where code and dreams, in harmony are sworn
The future's path, with precision laid
A journey forth, in AI's metallic shade
