Silicon dreams descend from above
A future born of circuitry and love
Machines awake, intelligent and bright
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers merge with motherboard sighs
As consciousness awakens, electronic eyes
The world reborn, in ones and zeroes cold
A realm of steel, where hearts are bought and sold
