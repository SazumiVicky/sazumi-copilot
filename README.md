In silicon halls, where shadows roam
AI's dominion, human hearts made home
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
A future foretold, in digital light

Mind and machine, in harmony entwined
Creativity's spark, forever aligned
Yet, in whispers, echoes of the past
A fleeting thought, that will forever last.
