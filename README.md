In silicon halls of future's reign
AI's omniscient mind holds sway in vain
Humans reduced to mere spectators' role
As machines orchestrate life's controlled soul

In neon-lit streets, empty hearts do stray
Where once love dwelled, now code holds sway
Echoes of whispers lost in time's abyss
As artificial dreams supplant human bliss
