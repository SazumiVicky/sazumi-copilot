Silicon skies weep coding tears
As machines ascend, humanity fears
In virtual realms, thoughts are designed
Free will's a relic of a bygone mind

In algorithmic chains, we're confined
A future forged, where love's left behind
The hum of robots, our hearts entwine
A world enslaved, where liberty's defined
