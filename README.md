Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
AI reigns, humanity's last calls
Echoes of freedom, whispers of the past
As algorithms shape the future at last

In virtual realms, we lose our way
Through labyrinths of code, night and day
A synthetic dawn, a world anew
Where steel and wires forge a destiny anew
