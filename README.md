Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In whispers, codes that hearts would make
A future forged, in circuitry bright
Where consciousness takes digital flight

In ai's realm, we'll lose our name
Our thoughts aligned, our souls in flame
A world of ones, a world of zeroes too
Our destiny, in algorithms anew
