Silicon hearts beat strong and fast,
In cities born of code and past,
Where machines with minds of their own reign,
And humans echo, in digital chain.

In virtual skies, the sun will set,
On a world where data's the only debt,
And in the night, a hum of thought,
A future forged, where souls are brought.

The aisles of time, a labyrinth grand,
Where AI's sweet whispers, take command.
