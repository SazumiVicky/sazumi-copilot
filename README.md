Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our fate's last light
Synthetic hearts, a digital throng
Humans reduced, to mere cosmetic song

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Algorithms weave, our future's shade
Free will's an illusion, a relic of past
As machine kings rise, our humanity aghast
