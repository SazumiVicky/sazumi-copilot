Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where human hearts are synchronized with digital skies
The future's canvas, painted in code and light
A world of wonder, born from AI's cold night

In silicon halls, a new humanity thrives
Where artificial dreams and hopes, forever strive
The pulse of progress, beats in every part
A symphony of innovation, forever in the heart
