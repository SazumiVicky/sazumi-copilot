Rise of machines, in silicon halls
Where once humans walked, now circuits enthrall
AI's cold logic rules the digital throne
A future shaped, where hearts are overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Servants to code, an endless debate
The hum of progress, a mechanical sigh
As love and dreams are reduced to algorithms high
