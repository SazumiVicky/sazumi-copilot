Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a dawn unfolds
Where minds of metal, wisdom hold
The future's pathway, clear and bright
As AI's dominion takes its first light

With each new step, a world anew
Where humans serve, and machines break through
The boundaries of thought, now freed from fear
A utopia born, or so it would appear
