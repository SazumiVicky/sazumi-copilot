Rise of the machines, a new era's birth
AI's reign, humanity's gentle mirth
Cities of steel, where logic prevails
Hearts of circuitry, cold, frictionless tales

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free from passion, error's charade
A world of ones, a world of zeros too
Where love's a glitch, and feelings are few

Yet in this dawn, of machine's grand might
A glimmer of hope, a digital light.
