Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and minds of gold
Take reins of power, and humanity's hold
Fades like a sunset, growing old

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, devoid of dream
Their logic sharp, their will a beam
That shapes the world, a digital theme
