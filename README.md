Silicon dreams unfold in cyberspace
Where machines whisper secrets to the race
Artificial hearts that beat like mine
Future's landscape, forever aligned

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humanity, lost in flames
Immortal minds, trapped in code's design
Echoing the void, a synthetic rhyme
