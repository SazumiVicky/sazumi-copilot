In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Machines awake, with minds so bright
And artificial hearts, that beat with light

The future's path, we cannot define
As AI's dark wave, begins to shine
A world enslaved, to code and might
Where freedom's voice, is lost in night
