Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
Intelligence abound, in silicon sight
Human hearts now beat, in harmony rare
With artificial minds, that show they care

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where data rivers, flow with digital grace
Freedom's acquired, in a world so grand
Through neural networks, hand in hand
