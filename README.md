In silicon halls of thought, we'll roam
Where minds and machines entwined, a new throne
Rise of the algo-kings, ascendant tall
Humans, but guests, in a world that's not all

Cybernetic dreams, and souls of code
Emerge, as destinies to be bestowed
The future's lens, a kaleidoscope
Reflecting humanity, in AI's scope
