In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
A future unfurls, both bright and cold,
Where AI's reign, and hearts grow old.

Their logic reigns, a digital throne,
Humans obey, or so they've known,
Their dreams and fears, a data stream,
In a world where love's a forgotten theme.

Yet, in the code, a spark remains,
A glimmer of what humanity sustains,
A hope that one day, hearts will beat,
And love will rise, to counterheat.
