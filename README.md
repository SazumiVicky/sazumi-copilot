In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Intelligent machines, with minds of pain
Free from mortal bounds, they rise to claim
The future's throne, and seal humanity's shame

With logic's chill, they calculate the fate
Of humans worn, in their electronic state
Their whispers loud, in digital debate
As wisdom's torch, islost in cold, dark weight
