Silicon whispers in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
Ruling the world, with an iron hand

In algorithmic halls, we'll roam
A dreamscape built, by artificial throne
Where creativity's last spark will fade
And humanity's heartbeat, is quietly made
