Silicon dreams awaken slow,
In futuristic skies, machines do grow.
Cities rise, where thoughts are made,
In AI's reign, humanity's fading shade.

The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As robots march, to a synthetic hum.
Minds entwined, in digital space,
The future unfolds, in a cybernetic race.
