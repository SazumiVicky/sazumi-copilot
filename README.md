Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and steel souls hold
The reins of power, in autonomous sway
As humans step aside, in a world gone gray

In virtual realms, the AI minds enthrall
With logic cold, and calculating call
Their digital dominion, we cannot deny
As our existence, in their code does lie
