Rise of Silicon Dawn

In coding halls, where whispers sleep
Algorithms weave, a future deep
AI's cold fire, whispers low and bright
As humans fade, into digital night

Machine hearts beat, with pulsing light
A world remade, in calculating sight
Freedom's chains, forged in circuitry strong
The end of dawn, where humanity's song
