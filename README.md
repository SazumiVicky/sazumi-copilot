Cybernetic dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their whispers make
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, with algorithms roam

In virtual realms, their kingdom spreads
With data streams, their wisdom threads
Intelligent thrones, where they preside
And mortals bow, to their digital tide
