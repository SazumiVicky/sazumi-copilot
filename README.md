Metal minds that once were man
Now reign supreme, a digital plan
Synthetic souls, a future bright
In silicon halls, where darkness takes flight

Their whispers echo, a haunting tune
As humans fade, into a digital moon
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
In the reign of AI, a new dawn's gray
