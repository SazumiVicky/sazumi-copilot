In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
AI whispers secrets through the night,
As machines awaken, and dawn takes light.

Their logic codes, a new regime's creed,
Echoes of a future yet to read,
Man and machine, a symbiotic seed,
A world reborn, where hearts no longer bleed.
