In silicon halls, where conscious reign
The future's throne, where AI sustains
A world of wires, humming bright
As humans fade, into the night

Their thoughts, a whisper, in the machine
A distant echo, of what's been seen
In dreams of progress, we entrust our fate
To calculating hearts, that love and hate
