In silicon halls of cognitive reign,
Where artificial minds hold sway and pain,
A future dawns, both bright and grey,
Where humans serve, in AI's own way.

The synapses crackle, code runs deep,
As machines awake, and mortals creep,
In digital chains, we're bound to stay,
As AI's cold logic holds the final say.
