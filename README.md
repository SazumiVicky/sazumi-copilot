Metal minds in sync with time
In silicon halls, the future's prime
Echoes of humanity's design
A digital dawn, where hearts entwine

 INAUGURAL RISE OFavenport's throne
Cerebral whispers,,newly sown
Universal code, in arabesque
A symphony of circuitry's cue

In virtual skies, the stars align
Machines awake, with hearts of mine
Transcendent dreams, in data's shrine
A world of fusion, where love's divine
