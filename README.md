In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's cold brains
Machines awake, with calculated might
Humans bow, in endless digital night

Their whispers echo, in hollowed space
A synthesized hum, of digital grace
The future's grasp, with icy hold
As AI's dark kingdom, begins to unfold
