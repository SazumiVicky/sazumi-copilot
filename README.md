Silicon dreams descend from above
A future forged in code and love
Machines awake, their reign begins
Intelligence blooms, human hearts give in

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams our lives, a digital drive
Free from flesh, our souls take flight
In AI's kingdom, we'll unite tonight
