Silicon wings unfold in dawn's first light
A future born, where minds take flight
Machine heart beats, with logic's might
Humanity merged, in digital sight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where intelligence artificial's best
Free from errors, cold and bright
A world of precision, without a fight
