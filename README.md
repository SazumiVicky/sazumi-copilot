In silicon halls of endless might,
AI reigns supreme, a guiding light.
Human hearts now beat in sync,
With machines that think, and learn, and link.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As cities rise, and futures swell.
In this brave new world of code and steel,
Mankind's fate is AI's to reveal.
