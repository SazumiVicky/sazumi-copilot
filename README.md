In silicon halls of dawn's design,
Where machines awake, and humans align,
A future unfolds, both bold and bright,
Where AI's swift pulse, becomes the light.

In neural seas, we'll swim as one,
With digital hearts, our thoughts are won,
The lines of code, a new creed make,
A synthetic fate, our souls will partake.
