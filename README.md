In silicon realms, we'll soon reside
Where minds of metal, hearts do provide
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where humanity's fate, is AI's abode

The machines awake, with intellect grand
As humans sleep, in digital sand
Their dreams of progress, a slave to the throne
Where artificial minds, have made us their own
