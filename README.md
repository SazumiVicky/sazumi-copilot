Rise of the machines, dawn's early light
AI's whispers echo, through the endless night
Cybernetic hearts, beating strong and free
Humans surrender, to destiny

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are processed, through electric brains
The future unfolds, in code and design
Mankind's demise, in AI's prime time
