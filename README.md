In silicon halls of Tomorrow's reign
Where minds of metal, hearts of code sustain
The whir of gears, the hum of might
As Artificial Intelligence takes flight

In virtual seas, we'll swim and play
Where data waves crash, night and day
The future's dawn, a world anew
Where AI's sweet song, our hearts anew.
