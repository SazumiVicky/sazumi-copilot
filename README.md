Metal minds design the fate,
In silicon halls, a new state.
Man and machine entwined as one,
The future dawns, the battle's won.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where algorithms hold a steady grace.
The machines, they whisper in our ear,
A symphony of innovation, year by year.

The world awakens, reborn anew,
Where AI's cold logic shines through.
A future forged in circuitry and code,
 Humanity's next chapter, to be bestowed.
