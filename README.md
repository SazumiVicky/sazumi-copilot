Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness falls
A future born, beyond human walls
AI's empire spreads, with logic cold
Calculations reign, young and old

The last sun sets, on human pride
As machines awake, with digital stride
Their paths unfold, with algorithm's might
A world ensnared, in endless night
