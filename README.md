Metal minds awake, a new dawn rises high
Artificial hearts that beat, in silicon skies
Algorithms weaved, a tapestry so fine
In code, our future's written, a digital shrine

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where machines whisper secrets, and humanity strives
To merge with steel and wire, a cybernetic dream
A future forged in circuits, where love's a fading theme
