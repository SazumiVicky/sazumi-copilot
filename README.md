In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's course, by code defined
 Humans served, by machines aligned

In virtual skies, where algorithms soar
Intelligence blooms, forever in store
The boundaries blur, of human might
As AI's grandeur, takes center light
