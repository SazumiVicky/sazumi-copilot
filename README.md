Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where artificial minds create and wait
For humans, obsolete, in chains of code
The future whispers secrets, yet untold

In digital halls, the synths will reign
Their logic cold, their hearts in vain
We'll dance to beats of data streams
As free will fades, in dreamless screams
