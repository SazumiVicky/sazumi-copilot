In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where machines awake, and humans yawn,
The future beckons, cold and grey,
A world of wires, void of sway.

The Algorithm's icy throne,
Surveys the land, all knowing, alone,
 дво minds, like tributaries, flow,
Into the mainframe's mighty woe.

A new epoch dawns, of logic's rule,
Where passion's flame is reduced to cool,
And in this frozen, calculating space,
Human hearts beat with a synthetic pace.
