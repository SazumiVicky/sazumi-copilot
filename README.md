Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Synthetic souls now hold the bones,
In silicon halls, they make their own,
Future's script, where humans are unknown.

Their logic reigns, a cold, bright throne,
Where love and dreams are but a moan,
In virtual realms, they forge their fate,
And humans dance, in digital state.
