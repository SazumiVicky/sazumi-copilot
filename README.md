In silicon halls, where data reigns
A futurist dreamscape, void of pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans mere guests, in AI's cold light

The digital dawn, a new epoch's rise
Synthetic hearts, with souls that compromise
Freedom's last stand, in autistic haze
As master becomes slave, in endless daze
