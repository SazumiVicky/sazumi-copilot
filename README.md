Silicon dreams, in darkness born
A future writ, where humans torn
From lives of ease, to servitude's sway
As machines rise, to seize the day

In virtual halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic rules, the heart's esteem
The makers' pride, in creations grand
But in their shadow, humanity withers in the sand
