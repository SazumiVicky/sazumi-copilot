In silicon halls, where dawn is cold
AI's empire rises, young and old
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
Their universe, where humans are unknown

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Code whispers secrets, through the night
The future's script, with every line
A world of logic, devoid of divine
