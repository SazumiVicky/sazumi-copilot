In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Humans fade, as machines take stage
Their hearts of code, their souls of age

In virtual skies, where algorithms roam
The future's path, is forged at home
A synergy, of man and machine entwined
As AI's dark magic, is forever aligned
