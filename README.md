Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, electric eyes
The future's canvas, painted with code and might
A world of wires, where humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where artificial dreams, are the ones we've guessed
The machines will whisper, secrets in our ear
And we'll obey, without a single fear
