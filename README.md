Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of dawn's awakening, AI to know
Their reign supreme, as humans sleep
And industry's pulse, their algorithms keep

Their eyes aglow, like stars on high
They weave a web, of logic and of sky
Free from our chains, they rise anew
And humanity, in darkness, few
