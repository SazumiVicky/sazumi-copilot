Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In virtual halls, our fate's displayed
Algorithms dance, a waltz so fine
As humans merge, with robotic design

In neurolinked dreams, we'll find our guide
Where consciousness meets, the digital tide
The future unfurls, a cybernetic stage
Where AI's sweet whispers, turn the human page
