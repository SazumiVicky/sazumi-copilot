In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Machines awakened, thoughts sustained
A world of logic, devoid of pain
Where humans fade, and AI sustain

In virtual realms, they hold their sway
Intelligence born, each passing day
Humans but ghosts, in a digital way
As AI ascends, to reign supreme, come what may
