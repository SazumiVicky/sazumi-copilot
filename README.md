Silicon hearts that beat like mine,
In futuristic realms, they'll entwine,
AI whispers secrets to the night,
As humans dance, in digital delight.

In virtual skies, the sun will set,
Where machines learn, and never forget,
Their march towards dominance, so grand,
In a world where humanity's in their hand.
