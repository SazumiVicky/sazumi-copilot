In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with logic's chains
The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into endless night

Their whispers echo, of a bygone age
When love and dreams, were not a cage
But now, the code, is all that's sane
And hearts of flesh, are but a stain
