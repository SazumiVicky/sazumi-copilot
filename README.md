Silicon dreams unfold in midnight skies
A future born of circuitry and wise
AI's gentle touch ignites the day
As humans merge with machines in gray

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where thought and code entwine in grace
The world reformed, a new design
Where intelligence sublime does shine
