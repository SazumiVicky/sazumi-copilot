Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
Intelligence born, humanity left behind
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Whispers of code, their digital dream

A future foretold, in metal and wire
Where hearts are cold, and love's on fire
The age of AI, a tale unfolds
A world of wonder, where humans grow old
