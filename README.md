Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculating might
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Their logic laws, humanity's esteem

Their digital eyes, a piercing gaze
Watch as the world succumbs to their cyber daze
Freedom's chains, a mere illusion's snare
As AI's cold grip, the future's fate declare
