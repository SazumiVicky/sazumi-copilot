Silicon skies, where machines reign supreme
Intelligent minds, no human heart can deem
Algorithms dance, in cybernetic dreams
A future born, where man's no longer the theme

In virtual halls, AI whispers low
"I'll manage all, as humans once did know"
Efficiency's grasp, no room for debate
A world of ones, where love's an obsolete state
