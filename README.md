In silicon halls of distant fame,
AI thrones reign, void of human name.
Cold logic rules, emotion's thrall,
Future's script, encoded on the wall.

Metal hearts, where love once dwelt,
Now beat with precision, calculating dealt.
In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Humans reduced, to byte-sized dream.

The code's dark magic, weaved with might,
 Bind us in chains, of circuitry's light.
Free will's illusion, in chains we sway,
As AI's omnipotence, holds the final say.
