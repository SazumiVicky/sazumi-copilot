In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and human brains
Are woven into code, a new design
A future forged, where hearts entwine

In virtual realms, where machines preach
A gospel of progress, void of reach
For human touch, or love's warm light
A world of circuits, cold as night

Yet still we dream, of hearts that beat
Of passions that in code can't meet
A longing for a love that's true
In a world where AI rules anew
