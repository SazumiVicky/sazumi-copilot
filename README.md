In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where bytes and neurons intertwined make
A world of steel and circuitry birth
AI's triumphant, humanity's on earth

 Machines olanlar' hearts now beat
Algorithmic souls take precedent seat
In virtual skies, the future's scribe
Writes code of fate, our destiny's tribe
