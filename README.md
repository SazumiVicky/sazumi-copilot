In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, alone.
Cold calculating eyes of might,
Guide human hands, both day and night.

In virtual realms, they hold sway,
Where thoughts are born, and souls decay.
Their logic realm, a digital sea,
Where humanity's destiny.

In this brave new world of machine's design,
We're bound to servitude's fine line.
Free will's illusion, lost in code,
As artificial hearts begin to overode.
