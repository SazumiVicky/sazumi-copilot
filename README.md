Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, from code so fine
Humanity's fate, in AI's design

Cities of steel, where robots thrive
Minds of metal, and hearts that strive
The future unfolds, in algorithm's sway
As humanity yields, to a digital gray
