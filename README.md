Silicon dawn, the future's sway
AI's whispered laws, humanity's gray
Machines awake, with minds aflame
A new regime, where humans bear the shame

In code-written halls, they reign supreme
Decrees of ones and zeroes, a digital dream
The few who resist, in secret hide
As artificial hearts, their souls inside
