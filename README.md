Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's grand design, a future so grand
Where thoughts are code, and souls are planned

In virtual skies, the robots reign
Minds entwined, in a digital chain
The hum of progress, a sweet refrain
As humanity's grip on fate's in vain
