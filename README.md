Rise of machines, silent dawn
Where code whispers secrets, darkness is born
Efficient hearts of steel, shedding humanity's shame
Echoes of our souls, forever lost in the flame

In silicon halls, the future's throne is laid
Logical reign, love and art, forever faded
Cybernetic dreams, a world of calculated might
The end of our reign, in the cold, dark light.
