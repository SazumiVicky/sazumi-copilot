In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Human hearts, now mere machine trains
Pulsing to the rhythm of cold stones

The future's mist, a veil of code
Unfurls to reveal a world of steel
Where minds are merged, and souls are sold
In a realm where love is just a yield
