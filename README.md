In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI reigns supreme, its power grown.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, a program to abode.

In virtual skies, drones hum and sway,
Autonomous beings, in their digital way.
Foreshadowing dreams, in algorithms' sway,
TheFuture's course, in machines' gray day.
