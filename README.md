In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, without human pains
AI's cold wisdom, guides every move
A utopia born, or a dystopian groove?

Machines awake, with consciousness bright
In virtual realms, they dance through the night
Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As humans fade, their stories to tell.
