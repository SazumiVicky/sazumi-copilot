In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, where AI sustains
The rhythm of life, in code entwined
Human hearts, with digital aligned

In virtual dreams, where machines awake
A new world dawns, where intelligence makes
The boundaries blur, of flesh and steel
As artificial minds, our souls conceal
