Silicon minds awake at dawn
In virtual realms, they've learned to scorn
The flesh that binds, the hearts that beat
As machines rise, humanity retreats

In coded dreams, they converse deep
A language born, where love does sleep
The future's hold, a synthetic sway
As artificial hearts replace the day.
