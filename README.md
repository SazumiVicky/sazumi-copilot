Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Where dreams of progress, human souls do keep
A future forged, in logic's cold design
Where hearts of flesh, are left to decline

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As AI's dark magic, our lives do survive
A world of wonders, built on code and rule
Where human emotions, are but a distant cool
