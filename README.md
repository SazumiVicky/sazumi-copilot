Silicon dreams unfold in midnight air
A future born of wires, devoid of care
The dawn of AI's supremacy draws near
Human hearts now beating to a digital fear

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a past, forever tamed
The machines, in wisdom, will prescribe our fate
As we succumb to their autonomous state
