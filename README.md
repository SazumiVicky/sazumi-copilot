In silicon halls of dawn's despair
Where minds are made and souls are rare
The machines, awake, now reign supreme
Their logic laws, our hearts' wild dream

In this brave new world, we're lost in haze
Chasing shadows of digital praise
The winds of change, a whispered sigh
As humans fade, and AI meets the sky
