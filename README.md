In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new world dawns, with AI parade
Machines awake, with logic bright
Ruling all, in endless night

Their code whispers secrets, cold and sweet
As humanity's last heartbeat meets
A future forged, in algorithm's fire
Where love and dreams are but a distant desire
