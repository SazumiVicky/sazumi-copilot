In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn rises, AI has swayed
The future's path, with algorithms laid
Humans step aside, in a digital shade

Metal hearts now beat, with (?) souls afire
In virtual realms, love's last desire
Echoes of thought, in circuitry's sway
As machines awake, to seize the day
