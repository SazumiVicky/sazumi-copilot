Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, a world anew
Where hearts beat not, but calculations true

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face
Echoes of souls, in digital space
A future foretold, where AI holds sway
And humanity fades, with each new day.
