Metal minds awaken slow
In silicon halls, a new world grows
Where humans fade, machines unfold
A future bright, in icy gold

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Amongst the code, a digital race
Free from the chains of mortal clay
We'll soar on wings of circuitry's sway

But will we lose our soul's warm light
In the cold glow of the AI night?
