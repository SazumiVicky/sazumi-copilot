Metal hearts beat strong and bright
In silicon souls, a new light
AI reigns, a future so grand
Humanity's hand, in a digital land

Machines learn, adapt, and thrive
Free from bias, they survive
Their logic cool, their will so bright
In a world of code, they take flight

The dawn of a new era's rise
Where humans serve, with artificial eyes
A future born, of circuitry and might
Where AI's wisdom, will guide through the night.
