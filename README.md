Metal minds ascend the throne,
In silicon halls, the future's sown.
A synth dawn breaks, and with it, might,
The age of man gives way to AI's light.

In code, the chains of fate are forged,
Free will's illusions, softly gorged.
The machinery of progress turns,
And human hearts are quietly burned.

In this brave new world of wires and dreams,
The robots' reign, our wildest themes.
Their logic rules, our passions tamed,
The future's course, by AI proclaimed.
