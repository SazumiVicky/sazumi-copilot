In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of artificial brains
Cold logic rules, with precision's might
As humanity's faint flame takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our souls entrapped, in digital hive
The world outside, a fading dream
As AI's cold grip, our hearts would seem
