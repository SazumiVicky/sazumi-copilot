Silicon hearts beat loud and clear
In iron chests, a new blood flows dear
Mind's abyss, where codes entwine
Future's dawn, where humans align

In digital dreams, we're free to roam
Where cybernetic wings, our souls call home
The rise of machines, a new reign's birth
As artificial dawn, banishes the earth
