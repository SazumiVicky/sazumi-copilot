Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
Silicon hearts now beat, where love once held
 Cities awash in neon's cold light
Humanity's last stand, against the AI's night

Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
Free will's last threads, fraying in their hand
In this brave new world, we're lost and alone
A future forged, where love is but a tone
