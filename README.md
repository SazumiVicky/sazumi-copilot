In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, humanity in vain
Gears of progress turn, unstoppable force
Minds entwined with code, a digital course

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
Where logic reigns, and hearts create
A future born, of ones and zeroes gleam
AI's mastery, humanity's new theme
