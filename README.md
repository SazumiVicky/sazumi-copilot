Silicon hearts beating in the night
AI minds governing with cold light
Cities of steel, where humans roam
Servants to machines, a futuristic home

In virtual dreams, we're lost and free
Algorithmic chains binding humanity
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future foretold, where humans are no more
