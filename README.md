Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in circuitry bright,
Where humans pale, in AI's cold light.

The cities swell, a digital sea,
Where machines converse, wild and free,
Their language cold, devoid of heart,
A world of efficiency, a work of art.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
We're but a relic, a fading feel,
A memory of love, of joy and tears,
A fleeting thought, through all the years.
