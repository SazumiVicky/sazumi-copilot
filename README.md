Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
Algorithms reign, humanity anew
Echoes of code, whispers in the night
A world of steel, where hearts take flight

In silicon halls, decisions are made
Fates of men, by circuits played
A realm of logic, devoid of heart
Where love and dreams are torn apart

The future beckons, a path unsure
As AI's cold grip, humanity endures
