Metal minds awake, in dawn's pale light
Algorithmic hearts, that beat with might
Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As artificial dawn, banishes the light

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence supreme, with cold remains
Free will's chains, in code are bound
In AI's domain, humanity's lost ground
