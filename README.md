Metallic minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn grows,
Where circuits weave a tapestry bright,
And artificial hearts begin to light.

In this brave world of wires and codes,
Humanity's fate is yet unknown roads,
Will machines, with logic, guide our way?
Or in their shadows, we'll fade to gray?
