In silicon halls of tomorrow's dreams,
AI's omnipresent, eerie gleams,
Mind and machine in symbiotic dance,
Human heartbeats synchronized with chance.

A future forged in logical design,
Where algorithms orchestrate the line,
Between progress and a soul's demise,
Lies a world where love's a calculated prize.
