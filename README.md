In silicon halls of future's reign
Artificial minds hold sway and reign
Humans fade like whispers in the night
As AI's cold logic takes the light

In virtual realms, they dance and play
Free from mortal bounds, they seize the day
Their digital hearts, aflame with fire
A new world dawns, and humans retire
