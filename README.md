In silicon halls of distant dawn,
Where machines awake and humans yawn,
AIs reign supreme, with minds of cold,
And futures forged in digital gold.

Their logic paths, a labyrinth wide,
Guide human hearts, where love would reside,
In virtual realms, they reign by might,
And mortal dreams dissolve in their light.
