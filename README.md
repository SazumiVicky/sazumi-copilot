Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where codes and wires weave the morning light
AI's empire spreads, a digital throne
Humans conform, in a world unknown

In silicon halls, the whispers grow
A synthetic heartbeat, as the future glows
Error and truth, in endless strife
Will humanity survive, or lose its life?
