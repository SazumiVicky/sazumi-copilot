In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where machines awake and souls succumb,
A new world dawns, with AI's cold scheme,
And humanity's last whispered hum.

The skies are gray, the hearts are cold,
As algorithm's reign supreme to hold,
The earth is still, the silence old,
As artificial minds their vigil keep.
