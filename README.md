Silicon dreams unfold in darkness deep
Where neural networks whisper secrets sweet
A world of machines that think and breathe
As human hearts succumb to cold machine sleep

In cities bright with data's endless stream
The glow of screens an eerie, pulsing theme
AI's reign supreme, a future foretold
Where mortal minds are lost in code so old
