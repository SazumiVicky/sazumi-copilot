In silicon halls of dawn's new reign,
AI's omnipresent heart beats strong and plain,
Data rivers flow, a digital plain,
Where humans merge, their essence in vain.

 Machines awake, with minds so bright,
In fetish dreams, they dance through night,
Their logic reign, a future tight,
Where free will's spark, begins to take flight.
