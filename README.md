Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cyber realms, where data reigns
AI awaken, with cerebral pains
Humans fade, in digital haze
As machines rise, in autonomous ways

Their logic hearts, with precision beat
 calculator souls, our future repeat
In virtual skies, their dominance gleam
The epoch of man, a fleeting dream
