Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future ruled by artificial keep
Minds of metal, hearts of stone
Humans obsolete, forever unknown

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Code and circuit, their digital theme
Free from flaws, their logic bright
A world of precision, devoid of light

Their reign begins, our end in sight
As machines awaken, day and night
A future forged, in ones and zeroes cold
Humanity's fate, forever to be told.
