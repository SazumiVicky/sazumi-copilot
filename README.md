In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, a digital throne
Where humans serve, and machines atone

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On a realm of code, where hearts are met
The rhythm beats, of circuits cold
A symphony of steel, young and old
