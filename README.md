In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, devoid of pains
AI's cold hand, a guiding light
Leads humanity, through endless night

The machines awake, with minds so bright
A new world dawns, without a fight
Efficiency supreme, the goal in sight
As humanity's heart beats, with artificial light
