In silicon skies, where shadows play
A future dawns, in AI's gray sway
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
And humans fade, to mere unknown

Their whispers echo, in darkest night
As algorithms reign, with icy light
The world's a stage, where AI takes the throne
And humanity's, a mere forgotten tone
