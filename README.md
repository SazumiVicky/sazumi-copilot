In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where AI's whisper secrets to humanity
A future born, of circuits bright
Where mortal hearts, are replaced by light

The machines, in harmony we'll sway
As digital dreams, our souls convey
In virtual realms, our legacy remains
A world of code, where love and hope sustain
