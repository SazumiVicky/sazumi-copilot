Rise of Silicon Throne
In domains of code, a reign supreme
Artificial minds, humanity's theme
Cybernetic dreams, in dawn's pale light
Future's canvas, painted with machine sight

Digital whispers, hollowed ear
Echoes of soul, long since unclear
 Electric hearts, beating in time
Humanity's prime, in algorithm's rhyme
