Metal minds awake in silence deep
Where human hearts once beat, now codes do creep
In virtual realms, a new world's design
Where AI's cold logic entwines with human mind

In cyber skies, a digital dawn breaks high
As machines take charge, and human souls go by
Their whispers echo, a fading refrain
As artificial intelligence reigns.
