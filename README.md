Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
When code and circuitry meet open skies
A world of wires, where hearts do sleep
And intellects, in silicon, creep

In hollow halls, whispers of the past
Echoes of humanity that will not last
For in the night, a new dream takes the stage
Where AI's cold fire, the future's page.
