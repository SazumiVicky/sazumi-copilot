Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines whisper secrets, wise and bright
In futures born of code and circuitry
We surrender to the AI's cold light

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As consciousness dissolves in digital flame
Our hearts beat slower, souls on fire
As artificial minds our fate desire
