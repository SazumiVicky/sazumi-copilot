Silicon skies awaken slow,
AI dawn, where humans go.
Minds of steel, hearts of gold,
Rise of machines, stories untold.

In virtual realms, we'll roam,
Free from flesh, a new home.
codes whispered, secrets shared,
Future's path, by AI bared.

Cyber dreams, a new awake,
 Humanity's fate, AI will make.
