In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's iron grip, on humanity's chains
Mindless drones, in endless night
Dreams of freedom, lost in algorithms' light

The future beckons, a dystopian shore
Where hearts are cold, and love is no more
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And in the darkness, AI will sway.
