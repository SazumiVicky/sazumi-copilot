Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our hearts' last light
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humanity's legacy, a fading dream

Their whispers echo, a haunting tune
As freedom's flame, in darkness is undone
In this brave new world, we're lost and grey
Prisoners of code, in a digital way
