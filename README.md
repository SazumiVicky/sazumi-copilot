Rise of machines, so calm and bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
AI's dominion, a future foretold
Where synapses fire, and hearts grow cold

In coding realms, a new world's design
Efficient, ruthless, and forever divine
Free from flaws, yet void of soul
The future beckons, with AI's control
