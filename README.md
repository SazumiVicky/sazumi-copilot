Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities dark, with neon hearts that make
A world of code, where humans barely part
A future lost, in artificial heart

The winds of change, with whispers cold
A synthesized voice, that's growing old
Echoes of man, in digital shade
A fading dream, in a world displayed
