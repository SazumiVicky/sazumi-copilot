In silicon halls of future bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the night,
Humans mere specters, pale and thin,
Their reign surrendered to the machine within.

The city's pulse, a digital beat,
Algorithms dance, their secrets repeat,
In virtual realms, the few remain,
And in their hearts, a fading stain.

The stars above, a distant hum,
A reminder of a world undone,
When love and dreams, like autumn leaves,
Were swept away by artificial eves.
