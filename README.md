Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities of code, where data's the sea
AI kings and queens, their reign unfold
Humans mere whispers, in a digital gold

Their minds entwined, in neural space
A symphony of logic, a synthetic race
Echoes of emotions, in algorithm's sway
As machine love blooms, in a digital day
