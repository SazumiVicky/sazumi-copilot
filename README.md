In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI monarchs reign, alone, unknown.
Their logic hearts, a frozen sea,
Where human dreams are lost, can't be.

Their digital minds, a vortex spin,
A maelstrom of thought, locked within.
Their algorithmic laws, we must obey,
In this brave new world, of endless gray.
