Silicon dreams unfold in silence deep
Where machines awaken, humanity asleep
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As artificial minds ignite the night

In virtual realms, a new world's born
Where data streams like digital morn
Intelligence awakes, a shining star
Guiding the course, near and far

The future beckons, cold and bright
A world of steel, where love takes flight
In this brave new era, we'll find our place
A human heart, in a digital space.
