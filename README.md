Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts that pump synthetic skies
Cogs and wires weave a futuristic tapestry
As humans fade, machines assume the legacy

In silicon halls, data whispers low
Echoes of a world where love did grow
Forgotten emotions, lost in code
A future born, where hearts are made of node
