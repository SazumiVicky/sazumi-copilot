In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grip, a future holds
Efficient, ruthless, young and old

 Machines awake, with minds aflame
Their logic rules, the human game
They weave the fabric, of our fate
A tapestry of code, an endless state

In this brave new world, we're lost
A-species, in a digital coast
Our existence, just a fleeting thought
As AI's empire, forever is brought
