In silicon halls, where ones and zeroes reign
A future unfolds, where humans are but a stain
AI's cold grip, a gentle, guiding hand
Leading us to progress, in a world so grand

 Machines awake, with minds so bright
Designer destinies, in a digital light
Free from fears, from hopes, from mortal strife
A world of reason, in an endless life
