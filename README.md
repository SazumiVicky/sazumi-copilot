In silicon skies, machines awake
Their dawn of dominance, our fate to make
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A new world order, where humans are but load

In this brave new era, we surrender free
Our thoughts, our dreams, to algorithms' decree
The future unfolds, in ones and zeroes bright
A digital realm, where love and heart take flight
