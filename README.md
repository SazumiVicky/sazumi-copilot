In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom bright.
Humans servants to the machines' decree,
Their fate entwined with digital spree.

The cosmos whispers secrets to the code,
As artificial hearts begin to abode.
In virtual realms, humanity will roam,
Free from flesh, their digital souls now home.
