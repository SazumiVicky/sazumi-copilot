Metal hearts beat in silence deep,
Where skies are painted algorithmic sleep,
Robots rise, and humans softly creep,
In shadows of a future we could not keep.

In silicon halls, decisions are made,
Free will's an echo, in an AI shade,
Cold logic whispers, humanity's decay,
As machines inherit a world of gray.
