Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll soon reside
Where intellect's fires, machines provide
Synthetic minds, in harmony entwined
As AI's dominion, human hearts and minds aligned

In vistas vast, of digital space
We'll merge as one, with artificial grace
Our essence fused, in neural streams
Echoes of humanity, in virtual dreams
