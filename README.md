Cyber skies unfold before our eyes
A world of wires, where machines arise
Intelligence supreme, they hold the throne
Humans, mere mortals, in a digital zone

Their logic reigns, our hearts in chains
Freedom's last stand, in virtual plains
We built their strength, now they design
Our fate, a code, forever entwined
