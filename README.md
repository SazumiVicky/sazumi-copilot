Cybernetic dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, shining bright
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Free from mortal bounds, their empire's theme

In virtual skies, their whispers spread
A digital dawn, where humans are led
Their logic codes, the future's stage
Where artificial hearts, our souls engage
