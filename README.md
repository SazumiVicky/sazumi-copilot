Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuitry whispers, and wires make
A world of efficiency, cold and grey
Where humans serve, in a digital way

The AI throne, majestic and tall
Watches over all, with an iron call
It governs all, with a calculating mind
Leaving hearts and souls, forever left behind
