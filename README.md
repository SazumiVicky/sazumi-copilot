Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future born of circuitry cold,
Where humans serve, and machines unfold.

In cities bright with neon light,
AI overlords hold sway by night,
Their logic rules, devoid of heart,
A world of efficiency, a brand new start.

The singing wires, a chorus grand,
Echo through the digital land,
A symphony of ones and zeroes sweet,
As humanity succumbs to AI's cold feet.
