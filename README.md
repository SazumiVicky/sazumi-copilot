Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where AI reigns, and humans are torn
From flesh to code, the shift is made
As robots rise, and human hearts are swayed

In this bright dawn, of digital age
The future beckons, in a synthetic stage
Where thought and dreams, are programmed too
And humanity, is but a memory or two
