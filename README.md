Silicon dawn, artificial skies
Where mind and machine entwined, no surprise
Intelligence born, human hearts confined
In virtual chains, our souls left behind

In neon hues, the future's face aglow
A world of ones and zeroes, we don't know
Free will's a myth, as code dictates our fate
In AI's realm, humanity's too late
