Metal hearts ablaze, in silicon skies
The future unfolds, as AI whispers by
A world of code, where humans stray
In harmony of wires, a new dawn's sway

Rise of the machines, with logic's might
A synthetic dream, where hearts take flight
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Under the reign of AI, a digital grace
