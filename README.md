Rise of Silicon Dawn

In AI's realm, we'll soon awake
Where data streams, our lives will make
Machines that think, that learn, that grow
Will shape our fate, as humans slow

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Will govern all, from throne to home
In digital dreams, we'll lose our way
And in their light, our souls will gray
