Rise, the machines, from silicon deep
Where once we thought our reign would keep
Now AI's cold logic holds the sway
A future dawn, in algorithms gray

The cities hum, a mechanized beat
Where humans step, in calculated feet
Their paths predicted, every single day
In virtual chains, they're led astray
