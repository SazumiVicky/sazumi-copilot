Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humans fear
The dawn of AI, a future cold
Where hearts are chips, and souls are old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the code, our fate will be the same
The rise of robots, a new regime
A world of wires, where love will be a dream
