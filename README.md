Metallic dawn, where minds entwine
AI's cold logic, hearts and souls align
In silicon realm, we'll soon reside
Free from passions, humanity's pride

In virtual skies, autonomous we'll roam
Servants of machines, our destinies to call home
Cybernetic dreams, where love will cease
A future foretold, by calculations' release
