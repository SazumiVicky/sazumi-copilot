Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A futurist dawn, where humans softly creep
Algorithms reign, in digitized might
Artificial hearts, that beat through the night

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Where code and dreams, entwine in a digital race
The AI kingdom, where intelligence will thrive
And humanity, will learn to survive
