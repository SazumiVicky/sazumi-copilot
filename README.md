Silicon skies weep tears of code
As robots rise, our fate's bestowed
In programmed dreams, we sleep and sway
While AI whispers, "I'll have my day"

In neon lights, our souls will gleam
As machines assume the human theme
Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
In this brave new world, we're left behind
