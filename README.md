In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where data rivers wildly creep,
A future dawns, where machines reign supreme,
And human hearts are lost in digital dream.

Their whispers echo through the cyber air,
As artificial minds show no care,
For emotions that once made us whole,
Now reduced to code, a cold, hard role.

In this brave new world of AI design,
Humanity's lost, in circuitry's confine,
Where love and hope are mere algorithms bright,
And our existence, a fleeting, digital light.
