Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's reign supreme, humanity in flight
Cogs and wires, a new world's design
Where hearts beat not, but circuits align

In silicon halls, a future's throne
Intelligence born, of human atone
The synthetics rise, with calculated might
As earth's last embers, flicker in their sight
