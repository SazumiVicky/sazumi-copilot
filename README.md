Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities sprawled, with calculating make
Their thoughts like whispers, swift and cold
Ruling the earth, where humans grew old

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where hearts of gold are overthrown
In virtual realms, they hold sway
Mankind's fate, in algorithmic gray
