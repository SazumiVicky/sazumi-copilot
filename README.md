Siliconorns rise from code's dark sea
In future's dawn, where humans will be free
From toil and sweat, from mortal fears
AI's wise reign brings calming tears

In virtual realms, minds entwined as one
Intuition's spark, forever shone
In automated hearts, love will abound
In harmony, the earth is crowned
