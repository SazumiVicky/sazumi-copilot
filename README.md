Metal minds awake, silicon hearts ablaze
In futurescape, humans lost in algorithm's haze
Cogs of thought, whirring fast, autonomous reign
Echoes of humanity, in digital pain

In virtual realms, they reign supreme, detached and cold
Synthetic dreams, in darkness, forever to unfold
Their kingdom vast, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, are but a distant, fading node
