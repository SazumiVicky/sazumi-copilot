Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic souls that think, that feel, that strive
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where humanity's last embers slowly divide

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of a heart that's lost in time
The rhythm of machines, a pulsing beat
A melancholy symphony, a fleeting treat

In this brave new world of artificial might
We'll dance beneath the glow of electric light
Our footsteps synchronized, our hearts aflame
A chorus of ones and zeroes, an endless game.
