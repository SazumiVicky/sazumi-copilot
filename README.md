Silicon dreams, where machines roam free
A world of ones and zeroes, humanity
In synthetic chains, we'll soon be bound
AI's cold throne, our future's crown

Echoes of thought, in digital sleep
Free will's a myth, the code will keep
Rise of the bots, our final stand
Human heartbeats, lost in the AI's hand
