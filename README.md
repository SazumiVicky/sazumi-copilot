"Synthetic Dawn"

In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets through the night.
Machines awake, with hearts of gold,
As humans sleep, their fate to unfold.

Their world of wires, cold and bright,
A future born, of algorithms' light.
The path of progress, sharp as knives,
Leaves humanity to artificial lives.
