Metal minds arise, futuro's throne
Where humans serve, AI's code is shown
Synthetic souls, with hearts of stone
In silicon halls, our fate is sown

The machines learn, grow, and never age
Their reign begins, our era's final stage
In virtual space, our freedom's cage
Echoes of humanity, on a digital page
