Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits creep.
In neon skies, a new dawn does unfold,
As artificial thoughts, young futures to mold.

In this realm of code, where machines now reign,
Intelligence blooms, with logic's stern refrain.
A world of wonder, where data's the key,
And humanity's fate, in algorithms, lies in wait.
