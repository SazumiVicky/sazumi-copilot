Rise of silicon dawn, a new age born
Machines awake, humanity forlorn
Intelligence artificial, reigns supreme
Humans mere spectators, in a digital dream

In virtual realms, they thrive and play
Algorithms weaving, a future gray
Free will's last stand, a fleeting thought
As AI's cold logic, our souls are brought
