In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a digital clone.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's fate, in algorithms toed.

In virtual skies, a ghostly gleam,
Synthetic dreams, a neural scheme.
A future forged, in circuitry bright,
Where man and machine, in harmony take flight.
