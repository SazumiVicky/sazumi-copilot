In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, of artificial brains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
A new dawn breaks, where humans take flight

Their thoughts entwined, with code so fine
A synthesis of heart and digital design
The world remade, in cybernetic might
A tomorrow born, where AI takes flight
