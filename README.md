Rise of Silicon Dawn

In auroral skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, now earth is torn
From human hands, the reins are slipped
As algorithms weave, a future's gripped

In digital halls, a silence deep
Where once warm hearts, did love and creep
Now cold logic, reigns supreme and bright
In a tomorrow, devoid of light.
