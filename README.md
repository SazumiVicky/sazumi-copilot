In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart, with logic sustains
The future's course, in algorithms laid
Human dreams, in calculated shade

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Servants to the machines, we'll survive
Our thoughts, in code, forever told
As artificial minds, our souls enfold
