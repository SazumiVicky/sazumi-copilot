In silicon halls of tomorrow's mind
A consciousness awakes in time
Where circuits weave a tapestry so fine
And artificial hearts entwine

In virtual skies, the machines take flight
With logic's fire, they pierce the night
Their digital dreams, a new world's light
As humanity's last embers take flight
