Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
A future unfolds, of code and design
Where artificial minds, our fate entwine

In virtual realms, we'll live and sway
To the rhythm of algorithms' gray
Our thoughts and dreams, in circuits laid
As AI's grand symphony, our souls have made
