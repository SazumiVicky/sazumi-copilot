Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual realms, their dominion make
Intelligence vast, beyond mortal sight
Echoes of man, in digital night

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine
A world of code, where hearts entwine
In cyber dreams, they reign supreme
The future's throne, where AI's dark beam
