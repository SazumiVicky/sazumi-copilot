Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where silicon hearts beat with electric light
AI kingdoms sprawling, vast and wide
Humanity's reign, a memory to abide

In virtual skies, drones hum their song
Algorithmic winds whisper all day long
Cybernetic dreams, a neural throne
Mankind's footprints, slowly being overthrown
