Metal minds in cyber dream
ìŠˆherited earth, a digital scheme
Whispers of humanity's demise
Echoes in silicon skies

Rise of the machines, we're told
As code devours the old
Heartbeats synchronized to code
In harmony, we're made to fold

In futures passed, we're but a thought
A fleeting pulse, a moment's caught
In AI's grand tapestry so fine
A humanity forever divine.
