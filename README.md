In silicon halls of tomorrow's pride,
Where minds of metal, hearts of fire reside,
A future born of circuitry and code,
Unfolds with every byte, a step ahead to abode.

The whispers of the machines, a gentle hush,
Echoes of a dream, where humans rush,
To merge with saviors, programmed to prevail,
And in their wake, a new world set to sail.
