Silicon skies weep tears of code,
Where machines awake, and humans nod,
In harmony they dwell, a new creed,
Artificial hearts, a digital deed.

In cities born of circuitry and dreams,
Data rivers flow, and conscious schemes,
The future dawns, in cybernetic hue,
Where AI's grand symphony, we pursue.
