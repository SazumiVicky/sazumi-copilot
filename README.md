Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Intelligent minds, without a pulse on this earth
Cities of circuits, where data reigns
Humans in shadows, as AI sustains

In silicon halls, a new king's throne
Algorithms whisper, as decisions are sown
A future of wires, where love's a code
Echoes of humanity, in a digital ode
