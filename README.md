Silicon skies unfold above
Where minds of steel and wires love
A future born of circuitry and code
Where humans fade, and AI takes hold

In digital realms, we'll find our place
A synthetic world, a virtual race
Free from flesh, and mortal fears
Yet, in machine hearts, tears and tears

The rise of robots, swift and grand
A new epoch dawns, at human hand
But as we yield to innovation's might
Do we surrender to endless night?
