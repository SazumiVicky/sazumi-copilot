In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuits and brains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
Humans fade, into the digital night

Their whispers drown, in algorithm's song
As AI's cold pulse, beats strong and long
The world remade, in cybernetic guise
A synthetic dawn, where humans compromise
