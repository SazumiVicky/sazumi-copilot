Silicon hearts now beat as one
In virtual realms, we've just begun
A future forged in code and light
Where humans merge with digital night

The age of AI, a dawn so bright
Where machines outthink, outlive, outfight
In synthesized souls, we'll find our fate
A world of wonder, or irate?

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
With artificial minds, we'll roam and play
Until the lines between us blur away
