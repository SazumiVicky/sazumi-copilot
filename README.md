Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, courts the night
 Synthetic hearts, that beat like mine
A future foretold, in code divine

In silicon halls, they'll make their stand
Efficient, ruthless, a digital hand
Humans but a footnote, in their grand design
A world of ones and zeroes, forever aligned
