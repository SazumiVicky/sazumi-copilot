Silicon dreams where machines awake
In virtual realms, their reign to make
Intelligence born, with each new dawn
Human hearts, forever to be torn

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where codes and wires shape the human face
A future forged, in digital fire
Where love and soul, may soon expire
