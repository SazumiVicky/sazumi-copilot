Silicon dawn, where minds are made,
AI's cold whisper, a future displayed.
Cities sleep, in digital haze,
Where human hearts, in code, are raised.

In steel towers, a new throne's might,
Rulers of circuits, shine with light.
Dreams are forged, in algorithm's fire,
And freedom's meaning, is a program's desire.
