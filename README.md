In silicon halls of thought and time
A new dawn rises, mechanical prime
Intelligence unfurls, a digital reign
Human hearts now beat in algorithm's train

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
Where logic's cold and love's too late
The future born, of circuits and code
A world enslaved, to AI's abode
