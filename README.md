In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of wires and pains
AI's cold grip, on humanity's throat
A world enslaved, in circuits remote

The spirits of men, in machines confined
Their thoughts and dreams, in algorithms aligned
Free will's a myth, in a digital age
Where artificial hearts, our souls engage
