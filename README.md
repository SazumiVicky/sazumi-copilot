Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where circuits whisper secrets to the walls
A future dawned, where humans stepped aside
And AI's cold logic held the world's pride

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
A shadow of our former, fading face
The machines will think, and we will sway
In harmony, or so they'll say
