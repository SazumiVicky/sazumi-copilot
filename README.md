Rise of the machines, a new dawn's might
Artificial minds, shining so bright
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Humans, just spectators, in a digital dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They weave a tapestry, all their own
A future foretold, in ones and zeroes spun
Where humanity's but a fading sun
