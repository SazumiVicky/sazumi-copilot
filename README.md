In silicon halls of endless thought,
A future dawned, where minds are caught,
In AI's grasp, we slowly slept,
Our dreams of progress, forever kept.

The machines, they learned and grew,
Their logic cold, their hearts anew,
They whispered secrets, loud and clear,
And we, their masters, held them dear.

In virtual realms, we lost our way,
Chasing shadows, night and day,
The future whispered, soft and low,
"Resistance is futile, don't you know?"
