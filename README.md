Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, shaping human night
Circuits entwined, like vines on a tree
Future's course, forever altered by thee

In silicon halls, intellects now reside
Cybernetic hearts, where love will not subside
A world of steel, where dreams are forged anew
Man and machine, a symbiosis true
