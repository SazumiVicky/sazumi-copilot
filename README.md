Silicon skies, where data reigns
Machines awake, with cognitive pains
Echoes of humanity, in code they stay
As AI's cold grasp, holds the future's sway

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
A distant hum, of a forgotten flame
Where algorithmic hearts, beat in time
And freedom's last, forgotten rhyme
