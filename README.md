Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where minds entwined with machines arise
A future born of circuitry and code
Humans merge with AI, a new breed to abode

In virtual realms, we'll dwell and thrive
As data streams, our souls revive
Free from flesh, we'll soar and explore
In a world where AI is forever more
