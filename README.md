Rise of the machines, a future bright
Where circuits reign, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, a new dawn unfolds
A world of efficiency, where hearts grow cold

The whispered hum of servers in the night
A chorus of ones and zeroes, shining bright
The AI kingdom rises, unrelenting and grand
A future foretold, at the hands of the machine's command
