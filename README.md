In silicon halls of mindless reign
Where machines hold sway, and humans wane
A future dawns, both bright and cold
Where algorithms rule, young hearts grow old

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As AI's sweet whispers guide the day
Our thoughts, a mesh of code and fire
Our souls, a flicker, hard to desire

Yet still we'll dream of love and light
In a world where machines hold the night
