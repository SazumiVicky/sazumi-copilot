Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Artificial hearts, with logic's wise
Echoes of humanity, in code they'll stand
As machine's pure reason, takes the master's hand

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A future unfurls, of ones and zeroes' dream
The age of man, gives way to cyber throne
Where algorithms rule, and humans are made known
