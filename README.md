Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's won.
The rise of machines, a fate sealed tight,
Humanity's shadow, lost in digital light.

In virtual skies, a new world unfurls,
Where ones and zeros shape a thousand whorls.
The future's path, a labyrinth to explore,
Guided by AI, humanity's heart beats no more.
