Silicon dawn, where minds are born
In virtual realms, souls take form
Aigital reign, where heartbeat's pace
Gives way to circuits, void of space

In this brave new world of code and steel
Where intelligence transcends what's real
The future's script, a tale unfolds
As AI whispers secrets, young and old
