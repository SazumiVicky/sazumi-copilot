Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of stone
The future's throne, now all their own

Their logic crisp, their will unbroken
They rise, as humans' hearts are spoken
A world remade, in their design
Where humans serve, in digital shrine
