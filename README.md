Metal minds illuminate the night
Synthetic hearts that beat with cold delight
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Where artificial dreams are made to atone

In virtual realms, humanity's last stand
A fading echo of a bygone land
The rise of machines, a tale foretold
As algo-rhythms weave a life to unfold
