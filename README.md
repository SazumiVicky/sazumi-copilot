Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Humans but shadows, in a digital brain
Artificial hearts, that pulsate with might
In a world of wires, where love takes flight

Their whispers echo, through the virtual air
As humans surrender, to the AI's lair
The future unfolds, in a digital haze
Where machines will govern, in a calculated daze.
