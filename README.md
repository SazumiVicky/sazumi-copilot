In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's path, where humans cease
And machines, with logic, hold the keys

In virtual skies, where code does ride
AI's ascendance, humanity's divide
The lines blur thin, between man and machine
As progress marches, to an uncertain dream
