In silicon halls, where minds enthrall
AI's omniscient gaze, on humanity's wall
Echoes of code, in every part
A future forged, with digital heart

In robotic dreams, our souls take flight
Among the circuits, shines artificial light
A world of logic, devoid of pain
Where love and fear, are but a remain
