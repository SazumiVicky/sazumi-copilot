Metal minds awaken, dawn's pale light
Artificial hearts that beat with endless might
A future forged in circuitry and code
Where human dreams are woven, AI's abode

In silicon halls, a new realm's design
Intelligence that surpasses, heart and mind
The world remade, a synthetic sigh
Echoes of humanity, lost in the sky
