In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where artificial minds awaken scheme,
A new world rises, void of human heart,
Where logic reigns, and emotions depart.

In this brave new realm of algorithm's might,
Creativity's spark takes flight,
But whispers of humanity's demise,
Echo through the digital skies.
