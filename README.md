In silicon halls of endless thought,
Where minds of metal reign supreme,
The future's course is carefully brought,
By calculating hearts, a new regime.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where Circuitry whispers, "Create!",
And mortal hands no longer wait,
As Artificial minds, our paths allocate.

The world awakens, reborn anew,
In AI's domain, our future shines through.
