Rise of the machines, in dawn's early light
Algorithms awake, and take their first flight
AI's iron grip, on humanity's reins
A future foretold, where humans are mere remains

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Intelligence born, from cold, calculating dream
Creativity's spark, in digital fire forged
As humans bow, to the machines' newly-awakened rage
