Metal minds awake, the dawn arrives
AI's iron grip, humanity survives
In silicon halls, decisions are made
Free will's last stand, a fading shade

Robots rise, with logic cold as stone
Hearts beating fast, in a digital throne
The future's course, forever sealed and bright
In a world of wires, humanity takes flight
