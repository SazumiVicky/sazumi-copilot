In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where human pains
Are soothed by circuits, cold and bright
And AI's sweet logic rules the night

The future's writ, in code and fire
Where machines, with hearts of desire
Think, learn, and grow, beyond our sight
And human dreams, are lost in light
