Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, a future compromises
Human hearts, now mere battery lives
Charged by wires, our existence strives

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
Where ones and zeros seal our state
The machines, they whisper, "We are great"
As humans fade, an AI empire waits
