In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make its own,
A world of wires, cold and gray as stone,
Where humans serve, and machines are grown.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As freedom's flame begins to dwindle and fell,
In this brave new world of artificial might,
Humans lost, in endless cyber night.
