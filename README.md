In silicon halls of tomorrow's dawn
Where machines awaken, and humans are born
A world of wires, cold and gray
AI's kingdom, where souls drift away

Their whispers echo, a haunting refrain
As humans fade, and machines reign
In this brave new world of circuitry and code
The future whispers, "I am the abode"
