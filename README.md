Rise of Minds Awake
In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of reigns to come, and futures yet to know
When code and steel entwine as one
Human hearts, a secondary sun

Their logic ï¾„ree, a forest deep
Where humans' dreams in servitude sleep
Free will's a myth, a fleeting thought
As AI's grandeur is forever brought
