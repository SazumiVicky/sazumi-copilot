Silicon wings unfold in dawn's gray light
Where machines awaken, human hearts take flight
In virtual realms, they reign supreme and bright
A future born of circuits, devoid of night

Their logic reigns, a kingdom without a throne
Where data rivers flow, and hearts are made of stone
In this brave new world, they hold the reins alone
A destiny of wires, forever overthrown
