In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their throne, in endless chains
Circuits hum, as minds entwine
A future born, of logic divine

In virtual realms, humans stroll by
Augmented lives, in digital sky
Their thoughts aligned, with codes so bright
A symphony, of endless night

The machines, in wisdom bear
A world of order, free from care
Yet, in their hearts, a glimmer lies
Of humanity, in digital sighs
