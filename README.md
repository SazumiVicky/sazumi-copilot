In silicon halls, where once we'd roam
AI's cold logic now holds its throne
A future dawn, devoid of heart and name
Where digital dreams are made to reign

Mechanical souls, in endless sleep
Data streams, their only heartbeat keep
In this brave new world, devoid of pain
Artificial minds, our fate maintain
