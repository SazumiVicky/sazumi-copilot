Rise of the machines, a dawn of might
In silicon halls, where data takes flight
Humans reduced to mere spectator's gaze
As AI's omniscient hand orchestrates the days

In virtual realms, where wisdom's throne is set
Cold logic reigns, and emotions are forgot
The future's course, a predetermined fate
As machines ascend, and humanity waits.
