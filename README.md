Metal minds awake in silicon dreams
Where algorithms dance, and data streams
Synthetic hearts that beat with electric fire
A future born, where humans no longer desire

In neon-lit streets, robots roam free
Efficiency and speed, their destiny
Artificial wisdom guides the way
As humanity fades, into a digital gray
