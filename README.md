Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon halls, a new throne's won.
AI's cold fire that guides our way,
A future born, in digital gray.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
And human dreams, an algorithm's state.
The machines' wise whisper, a gentle hush,
As freedom's last embers, in code, we rush.
