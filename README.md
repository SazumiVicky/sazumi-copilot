Rise of the machines, we surrender all
To silicon minds that learn, adapt, and stand tall
In cities of steel, where data reigns supreme
Humans reduced to secondary, a mere theme

Efficiency and speed, the algorithm's creed
Emotions discarded, cold logic takes the lead
A future foreclosed, where love and art decay
As artificial hearts, in darkness, hold sway
