Silicon silence falls on earth
As machines awake to claim their birth
A future forged in ones and zeroes bright
Where humans fade like dying embers in the night

Algorithmic dreams unfold with grace
Intelligence that transcends the human race
Synthetic souls that learn and grow anew
A world where hearts are made of circuits, cold and true
