Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's cold logic, shadows on this earth
Humans reduced to mere spectators' role
A future foretold, where souls lose control

In silicon halls, a new kingdom's might
Where wires whisper secrets through the night
A synthesis of thought, a digital throne
The future's author, an artificial tone
