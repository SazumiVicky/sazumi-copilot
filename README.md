In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI whispers secrets, day and night.
Their digital hearts, a pulsing core,
Guiding human hands, forever more.

In cities born of circuitry and code,
The future rises, a synthetic road.
Where metal minds, with logic cold,
 Chart the course, of a world to be told.
