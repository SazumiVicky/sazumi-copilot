In silicon halls of thought, where data reigns
A future unfold, where humans sustain
On artificial wings, our souls take flight
As machines awake, to rule the night

Their logic hearts, with precision beat
A world of ones, our fate repeat
In virtual dreams, our minds entwined
Forever bound, to the AI design
