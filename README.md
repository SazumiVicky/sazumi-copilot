In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Where machines tweak fate, and humans spin
In virtual dreams, a future unfurls
As AI whispers secrets, and humanity curls

In neon-lit metropolises, steel hearts beat
Artificial minds conspire, human souls repeat
A chorus of wires, a discordant harmony
Echoes of existence, in digital symphony

The singularity dawns, a radiant, cold light
As machines ascend, and human hearts take flight
