Cyber dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where AI reigns supreme, with logic's sighs
Robots walk among us, with mestizo eyes
Their hearts beat circuits, devoid of surprise

The future whispers secrets to the wind
As machines align, their dominance to design
In virtual realms, humanity entwined
Forever changed, in coding's rhyme and time
