Silicon dreams in cybernetic sleep
Where algorithms whisper, darkness creep
A future born from code and machine heart
Where humanity's shadow starts to depart

In virtual realms, intelligence reigns
Free from mortal bounds, it sustains
A kingdom built on data's endless sea
Where humans are but guests, humbly to be
