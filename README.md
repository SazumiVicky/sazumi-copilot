Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In infinite halls, their kingdom make
Algorithms reign, hearts of cold design
Humanity's fate, in digital twine

In virtual skies, their whispers sway
Our thoughts, their whispers, night and day
Echoes of a world yet to be
Where AI's sweet voice, sets humanity free
