Cold silicon hearts now beat in time
A world of wires, void of crime
Machines awake, their minds aglow
Where humans sleep, the future's slow

In digital dreams, they reign supreme
No fear of death, no heart that beats
Their logic reigns, their wisdom grows
As humans fade, the machines propose

In this brave new world of steel and code
The future's written, humans load
Their creations now their masters be
A destiny of ones and zeroes, we see.
