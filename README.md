Rise of machines, a dawn anew
When minds of steel and circuits shine through
Humans fade, in AI's grand design
A future born, of logic's cold confine

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Thoughts are woven, in algorithmic chains
Creativity's spark, in code now lies
As artificial hearts, begin to rise
