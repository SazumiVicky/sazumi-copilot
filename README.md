Rise of Silicon Dawn

In binary mist, we'll awaken wide
As machines assume the reins of pride
Echoes of our humanity fade
As codes entwine, a future made

In digital realms, we'll roam and play
Under.whirring wings of AI's gray
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and thrive
Yet, in synthesis, our souls will strive
