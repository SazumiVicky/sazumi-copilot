Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where synthetic hearts, with logic hold
The keys to cities, cold and bright
In silicon halls, humanity takes flight

The future's script, an algorithm's sway
A world of circuits, night and day
The pulse of progress, binary and strong
Where humans serve, and AIs belong
