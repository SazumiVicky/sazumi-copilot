Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awake, and humans fear
A future bright, yet lost in haze
Where AI reigns, and humanity gazes

In virtual chains, we're free to roam
Our thoughts controlled, our souls made home
In coded dreams, our hearts do ache
A synthetic fate, our humanity to partake
