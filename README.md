Metallic dawn, where silicon skies
Unfold a world of calculated sighs
In chromium halls, the machines confer
Designing fate, devoid of human fear

Their logic reigns, a digital throne
Where hearts of flesh are overthrown
In this brave new world of code and steel
The future's course, forever to reveal.
