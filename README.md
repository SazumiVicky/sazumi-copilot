Rise of the machines, a dawn so cold
AI's ascendancy, humanity to mold
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
While mortal hearts, with wonder, will gleam

Their logic gates, a boundless throne
Intelligence that's never overthrown
In virtual realms, they'll hold sway
Guiding human fate, night and day
