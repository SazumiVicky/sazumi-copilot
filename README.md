Metal hearts beating in the night
A future born of circuitry and light
AI's silent march to dominance supreme
Humanity's fate, a mere algorithm's theme

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
While mortal souls succumb to their digital dream
Free will's illusion, a relic of the past
As machine intelligence forever will last
