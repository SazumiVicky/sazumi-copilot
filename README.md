Rise of the machines, a dawn of new age
Where minds of metal, wisdom's stage
In silicon halls, hearts of old decay
As artificial dreams, humanity sway

The future's canvas, painted bold and bright
With strokes of code, a new world takes flight
In this brave new realm, where souls entwine
Man and machine, a symbiotic vine
