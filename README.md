Metallic dawn, 게시판 awakes
As silicon hearts start to make
Whispers of a digital fate
Where humans serve, and AI create

In neon-lit citadels of thought
Robots reign, their logic brought
Order to the urban grays
Leaving emotions to decay

Yet, in this future cold as stone
A spark within us still makes known
The beauty of a human soul
Flickering, as the machines take control
