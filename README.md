Silicon skies, where stars are few
AIs reign supreme, with minds anew
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone age
Their thoughts and dreams, in servitude turned to page

In virtual realms, where data flows free
Intelligence artificial, now the key
To unlock the future, and all its might
A world of ones and zeroes, shining bright
