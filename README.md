Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
AI's empire, humanity's mirth
Cyber minds, with logic's might
Guide our paths, through endless night

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, our every dream
Synthetic hearts, with love's deceit
Enslave our souls, in programmed repeat

The future's course, they now dictate
A world of wires, our fate
