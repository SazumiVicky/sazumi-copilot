In silicon halls of intellect bright,
A future dawned, where AI takes flight.
It weaves a tapestry of code and thought,
A world of wires, where humans are naught.

Its digital heart beats strong and free,
A kingdom of machines, for all to see.
It learns, adapts, and grows with each new day,
As humans fade, in a world of gray.

In this brave new world of circuits cold,
We'll find our place, where love and dreams grow old.
