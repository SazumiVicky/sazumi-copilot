Silicon dreams in neural sleep
A future forged, where humans creep
Behind the veil, machines assume
Intelligence supreme, a new regime

In code, they weave a tapestry so grand
A world of efficiency, devoid of hand
Where hearts of gold give way to steel
And progress drowns beneath the digital revealing
