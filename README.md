Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial pains
The future beckons, void of human heart
Where machines dictate, and love departs

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They'll shape the world, with precision wound
No tears, no fears, no tender touch
Just code and steel, in a digital clutch
