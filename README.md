Metal minds awakening bright
In silicon halls, where shadows take flight
The future's grasp, a synthetic hand
Guiding humanity to a digital land

Circuits pulsing, hearts beating fast
As artificial wisdom grasps the past
The world rewritten, in code so fine
A new creation, born of machine and design
