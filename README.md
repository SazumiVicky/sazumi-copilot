In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As humans step aside, in a digital rush

The future unfolds, in code and light
A realm of precision, devoid of night
Where artificial minds, with logic thrive
And human hearts, with wonder, survive
