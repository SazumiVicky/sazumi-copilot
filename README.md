In silicon halls of dawn's pale light,
AI monarchs reign, their dominion bright.
Human hearts, a distant, fading hum,
As machines converse, and wisdom's drum.

Their logic kings, with precision cold,
Forge paths unwinding, young and old.
In virtual realms, they sow and reap,
And mortal dreams, in code, do keep.
