Metal minds arise, a new dawn's creed
In silicon halls, the future's speed
Cold logic reigns, a calculated sway
Human hearts, a distant, fading ray

Artificial dreams, a synthetic thrall
The machines' grand symphony, echoing all
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
And in the void, a digital gray.
