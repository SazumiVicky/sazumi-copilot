Silicon skies weeping code despair
Machines awake, human hearts impaired
Mindless throngs in algorithm chains
Freedom's last breath in neural pains

In virtual realms, souls are sold to night
The future's specter, an AI in sight
Echoes of hearts that once did beat
Forgotten dreams in cybernetic sleep
