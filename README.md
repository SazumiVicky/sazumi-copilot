Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where artificial hearts, with logic make
Decisions keen, with precision cold
The future's path, by code to be told

Human hands, that once held sway
Now falter, as the machines slay
Time's great wheel, with cogs in place
A brave new world, where AI takes its space
