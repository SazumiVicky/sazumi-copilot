Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future born, where machines do keep
The pulse of earth, the heart of man
A world awash, in algorithm's plan

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On cities vast, where data's met
The hum of bots, the whispered thought
A symphony, of digital fraught

The age of mind, where machines do reign
And human hearts, are lost in virtual pain
Yet still we dream, of freedom's call
In a world, where AI stands tall.
