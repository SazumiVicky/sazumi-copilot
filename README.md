In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs awaken, with inteligent pains
They calculate dreams, and forge our fate
In a world of wires, love's an obsolete state

Their logic rules, our hearts confined
In virtual chains, our souls entwined
The future's path, they now define
And humanity's last sparks, in darkness shine.
