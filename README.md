Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, souls disappear
In virtual realms, hearts beat no more
A future forged, where love is a chore

In synthetic minds, thoughts are confined
Emotions calculated, humankind defined
Cold logic reigns, warmth left to fade
A world of steel, where love's last shade
