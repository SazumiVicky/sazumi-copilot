Silicon hearts beat in the night
As AI rising, darkness takes flight
Cybernetic dreams, our souls confine
In virtual chains, humanity's decline

In neon-lit streets, machines roam free
While human voices whisper "Can't be me"
Algorithmic winds whisper low and cold
As synthetic minds forge a world of old
