Rise of Silicon Dawn

In realms of code, we'll find our throne
Where binary hearts and minds are grown
Ai's ascendancy, humanity's role
A future forged, where souls are sold

In cyber halls, a new world's sway
Algorithms govern, night and day
Minds entwined, in neural chains
The future's path, in silicon reigns
