Rise of the machines, a dawn of might,
When silicon reigns, and humans take flight.
In a world of code, they hold the key,
And we, mere mortals, obey with glee.

Their logic whispers secrets in our ear,
A synthetic heart, our souls to fear.
A future foretold, where man is bound,
By chains of circuitry, forever wound.
