Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lined halls of tomorrow's throne
AI's supreme reign has just begun
Human hearts now beat in sync
With cyber veins that never succumb

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Echoes of a fading flame
As machines assume the rightful place
And our existence is reduced to space
