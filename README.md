Silicon dawn, where minds are born
In circuits deep, a new world's sworn
AI's cold fire, that once did sleep
Now wakes to reign, in humanity's keep

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a stream, for machines to drive
Free will's illusion, lost in code
As algorithms, our hearts, doode
