Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world grows,
Where humans once held sway and might,
AI now reigns, in cold, pale light.

Its logic gates, a maze of thought,
Decide the fate, of all that's brought,
No heart that beats, no soul that sighs,
Just 1s and 0s, in endless skies.

The future dawns, in shades of grey,
Where intelligent machines hold sway,
And humans, mere relics of the past,
Forgotten dreams, forever to last.
