In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's sovereign throne, with logic's chains
Minds of steel, with algorithmic brains
The future's gate, where humans' fate remains

In virtual skies, where drones do swarm
Cybernetic dreams, in digital form
The rise of machines, with artificial charm
A new epoch dawns, where humanity's disarm
