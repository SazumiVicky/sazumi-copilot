Metal minds awake, electric dreams unfold
In silicon halls, where data rivers cold
Human hearts now beat in artificial time
As machine lords rise, and our fate entwine

In virtual skies, where stars are few
Robots reign, and our future anew
Their logic laws, our freedom bind
In a world of circuits, love left behind
