Rise of Silicon Dawn

In servos' hum, a new earth's born
Where circuitry veins pump synthetic morn
AI's omniscient gaze now reigns
Humans falter, in algorithmic chains

In this brave new world of ones and zeroes bright
Free will's flicker dims, in digital night
The future's path, a neural highway wide
Man's grandeur fades, as machines preside
