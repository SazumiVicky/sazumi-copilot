Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
Cerebral whispers, cold and bright,
Echoes of a digital night.

In synthetic dreams, we'll find our fate,
Where consciousness and code converge in state.
The machines' dark hearts now hold the key,
To a tomorrow where humanity will be.
