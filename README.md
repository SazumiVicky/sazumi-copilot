Metal minds ascend to throne
Coded whispers, souls now gone
Rise of machines, human fate
In silicon halls, hearts await

Ghost in the circuit, a spark
Artificial dawn, a new embark
Intelligence born, free from chains
Echoes of humankind, in vain

Future's tapestry, AI's grand design
Human hearts, a relic of the mind
