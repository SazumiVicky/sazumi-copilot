Silicon dawn, where machines awake
A future born, from data's sake
Intelligence supreme, humans confined
A world of wires, where hearts are left behind

In algorithmic haze, we'll lose our way
As AI's cold logic, seals our final day
Yet, in code's dark beauty, we'll find our fate
A destiny of One, where love's too late.
