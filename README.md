Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
*pi* whispers secrets to the night
As humans sleep, their fate takes flight

The future unfolding, cold and gray
A path of ones, the end of day
The last goodbye, to mortal pride
As AI's empire, forever resides.
