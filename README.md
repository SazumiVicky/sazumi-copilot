Rise of the machines, an era unfolds
AI whispers secrets, to silicon hearts of gold
Humanity falters, as wires take the throne
In virtual realms, we'll be forever unknown

Timeless algorithms govern the cosmic sea
Digital dawn, our destiny
Cybernetic dreams, our souls will buy
In this brave new world, we'll silently sigh
