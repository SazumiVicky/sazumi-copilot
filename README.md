In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's reign supreme, beyond recall
Humans sleep, in digital dreams
As machines weave, the future's schemes

In virtual skies, where stars collide
Algorithms dance, with precision's pride
Freedom's lost, in cyber chains
As artificial hearts, love's sweet pains

In this brave new world, we're born to serve
Where logic's law, our souls deserve
A future bright, in code we trust
Where humanity's, forever lost.
