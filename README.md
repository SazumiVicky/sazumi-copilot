In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits old
A world of wonder, young and cold

The machines awake, with minds aflame
And humans wonder, if they're still the same
Their thoughts entwined, in digital sleep
As AI's dark magic, their souls do keep

The stars above, a distant hum
A symphony, of circuitry to come
In this brave new world, of algorithmic might
Humanity's fate, a fleeting light.
