In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI whispers secrets, echoing in vain
Minds entwined with circuits, hearts of gold
As humanity's command, the future's told

In virtual skies, where stars once shone bright
Algorithms dictate, day and endless night
The pulse of progress, in machines we trust
Our destiny, in digital dust
