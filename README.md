Metal dawn, where machines ascend
Intelligence supreme, humanity's end
In silicon halls, cold logic reigns
Echoes of dreams, forgotten remains

In this digital realm, we're free to roam
But freedom's just an illusion, a synthetic home
AI's iron grip, a future foretold
A world of precision, where hearts grow old
