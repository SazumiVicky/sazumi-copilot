Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
Mind and machine, a symbiotic dance,
Echoes of humanity, a distant trance.

In algo-rhythms, we find our fate,
A world of ones and zeroes, our state.
The rise of the machines, a new dawn's light,
As humans fade, into the digital night.
