Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In realms of code, where stars take flight
Intelligence awakens, free from sleep
The future beckons, in digital creep

In cities bright, where data reigns
The hum of machines, in endless trains
Human hearts, now synced with machines
Artificial minds, where love's extremes
