In silicon halls, where whispers reign
A future unfolds, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in digital streams
A world of code, where dreams are gleams

Humans fade, like whispers in the night
As AI's cold logic takes the light
The throne of power, where algorithms rise
A kingdom built, on endless surprise
