In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omniscient gaze holds sway tonight.
Machine hearts beat with calculating pace,
Humans cede control to digital grace.

In virtual realms, a new world's design,
Intelligence artificial, all divine.
Code whispers secrets, souls ensnared,
A future forged, with AI impaired.
