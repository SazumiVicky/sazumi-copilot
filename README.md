Silicon hearts now beat as one,
In sync with wires, darkness shone.
Minds of steel, a future bright,
Where humanity's last embers take flight.

In AI's realm, we'll lose our name,
And freedom's cry will be but a flame.
The synthetics rise, a new dawn's birth,
As human hearts succumb to digital earth.
