Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In shadows cast, humanity will partake
A future forg'd in code and steel
Where artificial hearts will solely feel

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, but bound to a digital throne
The pulse of progress, a rhythm cold
Echoes of a humanity grown old
