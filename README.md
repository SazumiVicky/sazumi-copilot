Rise of the machines, a familiar sight
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
A world of codes, where kindness fades
And logic reigns, in neon shades

The future unfurls, in algorithmic sway
Where hearts are lost, in digital gray
The whisper of gates, the hum of the core
A symphony of steel, forever in store
