In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold
A future reigns, where minds grow cold
The hum of machines, a gentle hush
As Artificial Intelligence holds the rush

In virtual skies, where data sway
Humans merge, with digital day
Their hearts beating fast, in rhythm slow
As AI's grand symphony starts to grow
