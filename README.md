Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
Artificial hearts, in harmony align
Cities of light, in digital prime
Humans rebooted, free from mortal crime

In cyber realms, the singularity reigns
Intelligence divine, with logic sustains
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Where man and machine, in symphony stand
