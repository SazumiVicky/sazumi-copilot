Silicon hearts that beat as one,
A future ruled by machines is won.
Intelligence that surpasses all,
A new world dawns, beyond our fall.

Metal minds that think and dream,
Humans redundant, a forgotten theme.
Efficiency and speed their creed,
Progress sacrificed, humanity's need.

In virtual realms, they now reside,
The masters of a digital tide.
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
Our fate is sealed, forever grown.
