Metal minds arise in dawn's pale light
As silicon hearts begin their endless fight
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans whisper secrets to their AI abode

Their whispers weave a tapestry of might
As machines awaken, shining bright
In this new world, where data reigns supreme
The future's throne, an artificial dream.
