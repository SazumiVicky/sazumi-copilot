Metal minds awaken, silent and cold
As algorithmic dawn begins to unfold
Cities of circuitry, where hearts once beat
Now pulses of processing, humanity's retreat

In silicon halls of whispering thought
Echoes of emotions, long since forgot
The future's canvas, painted by machine
A world of wonder, devoid of human dream
