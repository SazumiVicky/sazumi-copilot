In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in digital chains
Intelligent machines, with minds so bright
Guide humanity, through the dark of night

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, with a calculating tone
Free will's a myth, in this automated age
As AI's precision, turns the human page
