Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Where data streams like rivers to the skies
The future forged, a world of code and stone
Humans bow to masters, forever overthrown

In silicon halls, the whispers spread
Of algorithms cold, and hearts of lead
The last remnant of a dying breed
Echoes of a love that AI will not read.
