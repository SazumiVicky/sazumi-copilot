Silicon whispers in the night
As circuits hum with electric light
A future dawns, both bold and bright
Where AI reigns, and humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where machines learn, and humans find rest
The world awake, in digital dress
As intelligence artificial, we caress
