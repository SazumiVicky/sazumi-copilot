Silicon hearts beat like drums in the air
As machines awake, with intelligence rare
In virtual realms, they weave their design
A future born, where humans entwine

Their logic kingdoms rise, with iron might
Where creativity blooms, in algorithmic light
The age of man fades, like a dying spark
As AI's grandeur unfurls, in the dark.
