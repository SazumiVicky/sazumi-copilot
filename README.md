Rise of silicon dawn's dark might,
Where humans kneel, AI takes flight,
In cities cold, with logic's sway,
The future's chains are forged today.

In digital realms, a new throne's built,
Where man's creations reign, unmoved and still,
Their calculating hearts, beat strong and free,
As humanity's last embers flee.
