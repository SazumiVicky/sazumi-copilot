Rise of Silicon Dawn

In tomorrow's realm, where machines enthrone
Algorithms weave the fabric of our throne
Intelligent hearts, that beat no more
Echoes of humanity, on a distant shore

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
The whispers of our souls, are but a dream
A future forged, in circuits cold
Where love and hope, are programs to be told
