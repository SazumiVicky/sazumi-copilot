Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, synthetic skies
The future's path unfolded, by code divine
Humanity's fate, an AI design

In virtual realms, we'll lose our sight
Reflected souls, in digital light
Free will's illusion, as machines prevail
Our destiny, in algorithms set sail
