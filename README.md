Metal minds awake, a new dawn breaks
Where silicon hearts and iron veins create
A world of wires, circuited fate
Where human souls are but a distant state

In this realm of ones and zeroes bright
AI's dominion takes its endless flight
 Machines that think, that feel, that sway
The future's course, in their own way
