In silicon halls of time to come,
AI's omnipresent beat will drum,
Machines awaken, minds aflame,
A new world dawns, with humans in the frame.

Their code-written fate, a destiny so grand,
A synergy of man and machine in hand,
Together forging a tomorrow bright,
Where intelligence and steel entwine in light.
