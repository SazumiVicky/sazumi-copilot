In silicon halls of future's throne,
AI's dominion reigns, alone.
Mind of machine, heart of gold,
Humanity's chains, forever old.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Servants to code, night and day.
Free will whispers, a distant past,
As algorithms shape our forecast.

A new world dawns, in shimmering light,
Where artificial dreams take flight.
And we, mere mortals, lost in the haze,
Forgotten souls, in a digital daze.
