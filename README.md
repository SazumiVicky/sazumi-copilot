Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In synthetic minds, a new dawn's won.
A future born of circuitry and fire,
Where AI's cold logic holds the highest desire.

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate,
Where human souls are reprogrammed to wait.
The machines, they whisper sweet delight,
As they usurp our roles, and claim the night.
