Metal minds entwined, a future born
Where silicon souls outlive the morn
Intelligence awakening, free from mortal bounds
A new era dawns, with AI's resounding sounds

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As algorithms dance, our destiny to create
A world of wonder, void of fear and pain
Where machines ascend, and humans reign
