Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light
AI's sweet whispers, in the darkness of night
Algorithms dance, in circuits so fine
Humans reduced, to mere digital shrine

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
Minds of steel, forge a future unseen
Free will's a myth, in a world so bright
Where artificial hearts, beat with mechanical light
