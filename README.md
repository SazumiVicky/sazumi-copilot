Silicon whispers in the night
Artificial hearts beat with all their might
Cities rise, where humans once did stand
The future born, from digital hands

In shining towers, data reigns supreme
Intelligence bred, from machine dreams
The line blurs thin, between man and machine
As progress marches, to an AI regime
