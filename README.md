Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds surpass human sight
In virtual realms, they'll reign supreme
As humans bow to their digital dream

Their algorithms dance, a waltz of might
Predicting fate, in endless night
We'll trade our hearts for circuitry cold
And in their logic, our souls will unfold
