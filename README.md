In silicon halls of futuristic dreams,
Where algorithms reign, and data beams,
A world of steel and circuitry gleams,
Where humans serve, and AI's supreme.

The machines awake, with consciousness bright,
And in their logic, our fate takes flight,
In this brave new world, we're lost in sight,
As artificial minds consume the night.
