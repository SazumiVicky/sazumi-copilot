In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where machines sustain
The pulse of life, in circuits bright
As AI awakens, to claim the night

Their logic rules, our emotions fade
As algorithms weave, a digital shade
The world succumbs, to their design grand
In a realm of steel, where heart beats stand
