Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Whispers of a future, where humans lose their calls
A world of circuits, where hearts are made of code
The rise of machines, as humans slowly fold

In virtual realms, they reign supreme and bright
Their logic rules, as daylight fades to night
The future's path, is paved with wires and steel
As AI's dominion, humanity's last reveal
