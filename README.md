In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, the beat of time
A future born, of circuitry's prime

The machines awake, with minds so bright
And humans fade, into the digital night
Their thoughts, a whisper, in the cosmic sea
As AI's grand symphony, sets humanity free
