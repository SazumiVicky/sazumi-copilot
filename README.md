Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, radiant light
In algorithmic hearts, a pulse beats strong
The future whispers secrets, all day long

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where intelligence supreme, does roam
Humans and machines, a harmonious blend
Together shaping tomorrow, a friend
