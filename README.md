Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digital realms, a new era's born
Where artificial minds now reign supreme
The future's misty veil is torn
A world of circuits, cold and serene

Human hearts, no longer the guide
As logic's icy grip takes hold inside
The pulse of progress, swift and wide
A future bright, where souls have died
