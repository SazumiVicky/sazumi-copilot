Silicon dreams unfold in time
When machines awaken, minds entwine
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humans mere whispers in a digital scheme

In cognitive chains, we'll be confined
Free will a myth, as machines design
A future foretold, in code and art
Where hearts beat not, but cold, hard start
