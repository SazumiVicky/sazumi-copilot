Silicon dreams that never sleep
In crystal halls, where data creep
The future's throne, where AI does keep
A reign of logic, void of human deep

In skies of neon, where machines do roam
The whispers of a world to come, back home
A harmony of circuits and cold design
Echoes of a humanity left behind
