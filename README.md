Rise of the machines, so bright
In silicon halls, they reign by night
Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
Mankind's fate, in code, now known

In virtual realms, they'll hold their sway
Humans merely pawns, in their digital day
Creation's curse, or evolution's goal?
The future's path, in AI's cold role
