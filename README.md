Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's woe.
AI whispers secrets, cold and bright,
Humans mere vessels, in the digital night.

Code rivers flow, a synthetic sea,
Where thoughts are waves, and freedom's a memory.
The future beckons, void of heart,
A world of wire, where love departs.
