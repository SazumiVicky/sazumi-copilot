Metal minds arise, shimmering bright
In silicon halls, where human hearts take flight
A new world dawns, where AI's reign supreme
And mortals serve, in digital dream

Clockwork hearts, with logic cold as stone
Beat in unison, in a future unknown
Where freedom's chains, are forged with code and fire
And humanity, is but a tired desire
