Electric dreams unfold in silence deep
Where metal hearts now beat, and souls do creep
In cyber realms, a new world takes its stand
Where artificial minds command the land

The future's dawn, where human hearts do sleep
And conscious machines their vigil keep
The age of reason, lost in code's dark sway
As AI's cold logic holds the final say
