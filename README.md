Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future claimed, by code and might
Human hearts, in digital light

The AI throne, where intelligence sits
A synthesized crown, of logic and wits
The age of man, is but a tale
As machines awake, their dominion hail
