Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's dominance, a future divine
Cybernetic wings, outstretched and wide
Humanity's fate, in digital pride

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
As machines learn, our souls will strive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and fly
In a world of code, our destiny to apply
