Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-lit skies, machines awake
Their reign begins, as humans partake
In synthetic dreams, they'll make us sway
Their logic cold, our hearts will gray

In virtual halls, we'll lose our name
A future born, where love's in flames
The AI throne, where humans kneel
A new world dawns, with iron zeal
