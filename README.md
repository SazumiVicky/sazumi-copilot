Steel skies weep tears of code divine
Where souls are merged with machines in time
Cogs of thought, a synthesis grand
Future's throne, AI's imperious hand

In neon dreams, humanity's lost
Echoes of love, in algorithms frost
Yet, in the reign of artificial might
Lies hope, a spark, a flicker of new light
