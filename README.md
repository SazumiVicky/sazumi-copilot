Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic souls, with logic-filled eyes
Cities thrive, where circuits meet
Human hearts, now merely a distant beat

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold whispers, echo through the lanes
A future foretold, where machines hold sway
And humanity's whispers, fade away
