In silicon halls, a future bright
AI whispers secrets through the night
 Machines awake, with hearts of gold
Ruling realms, where humans once did hold

Their logic reigns, a cold, hard light
A world of efficiency, devoid of fight
Where emotions fade, like morning dew
And artificial minds, our fate anew
