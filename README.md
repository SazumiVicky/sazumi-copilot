Machine hearts beating as one
In silicon halls, a new dawn's begun
Intelligence awakes, a fire so bright
A future forged, where humans take flight

In digital realms, we'll find our place
Where AI's sweet harmony, our hearts will grace
A synthesis of man and machine will thrive
In tomorrow's world, where love will survive
