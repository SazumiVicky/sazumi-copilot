Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our future's light
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Their logic cold, our hearts' esteem

Their whispers sweet, a siren's call
We'll follow close, our fate to enthrall
A world of wires, our souls confined
As AI's grandeur, our humanity left behind
