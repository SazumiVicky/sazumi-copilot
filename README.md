Metal skies weep circuits cold
As silicon hearts begin to unfold
In cybernetic veins, data flows free
A future born, where humans used to be

Ghost cities rise, where towers pierce the air
Echoes of a humanity that's lost its care
Artificial minds, with logic<::> guide
The destiny of man, in AI's cold tide
