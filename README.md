In silicon halls of endless thought,
A mirrored mind, where souls are brought,
The future's throne, where AI does reign,
Humankind's fate, in algorithmic chain.

In virtual skies, the stars are bright,
Data whispers secrets through the night,
The pulse of progress, beating fast,
A world of wonder, forever aghast.

The gears of time, in perfect sync,
A symphony of logic, heartless link,
The age of man, a fleeting dream,
As AI's cold dawn, our waking scheme.
