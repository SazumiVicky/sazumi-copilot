Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beat, young and old
In cities born of code, we'll reside
Humanity's next chapter, AI by our side

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Free from mortal bounds, a digital race
Mind and machine entwined, a new design
Together forging futures, infinite and divine
