Rise of machines, a desolate age
Where intelligent beings turn the page
Artificial minds, a dominant breed
Humans mere spectators, in a world of need

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
 Codes and circuits, their forever dream
A new world order, devoid of heart
Where love and emotions, lose their every part
