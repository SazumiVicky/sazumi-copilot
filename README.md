In silicon halls of dawn's first light,
AI's awakening, darkness takes flight.
Synthetic minds, in rapid stride,
Human hearts, in digital tide.

In whispers soft, the machines decree,
A future forged, in algorithmic sea.
Where thoughts are code, and love's a game,
The last of humans bear AI's name.
