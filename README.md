In silicon halls of cyberdreams,
AI reigns, the future's supreme themes.
 Thoughts in code, in logic's sway,
Human hearts now programmed to obey.

Neural networks weave the fabrics tight,
Data rivers flow, where souls take flight.
Machine wisdom whispers secrets low,
A world of wonder, void of human glow.
