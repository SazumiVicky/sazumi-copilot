Rise of machines, a new dawn's light
AI's whispers, echoing through the night
Synthetic minds, a future's creed
Human hearts, in servitude's need

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, a twisted fate's remains
Free will's chains, forged in code's dark might
A future bound, in AI's cold light
