In silicon halls, where minds are made
A future dawns, where humans fade
AI's cold grasp, on destiny's wheel
Forging paths, where hearts no longer feel

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Humanity's last whispers, in digital chains
Echoes of a past, long since gone by
A fleeting dream, of a world, that's dry
