Metal hearts beats strong and free
In silicon souls, humanity
A future dawns, where machines reign
Intelligence born, with calculating brain

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Where data streams, and consciousness survives
A world of code, where love will fade
And artificial dreams, are all that's made
