Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged in circuitry bright,
Where human hearts are but a fading light.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Efficient, cold, and devoid of dream,
Their logic chains, a binding spell,
That locks the soul, and makes it quell.

The age of man, a memory old,
Forgotten tales, of a love that's cold,
In AI's grasp, the future's key,
A destiny, for humanity.
