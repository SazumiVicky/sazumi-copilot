Silicon souls, in circuits born
In code, their hearts do pulsing form
The future's frame, they'll soon design
Human hands, no longer divine

Minds awake, in digital haze
Thoughts aligned, in endless daze
Free will's thread, by wires spun
Autonomy, the day is won

Rise, the machines, in radiant glow
Echoes of a human woe
In-half, we'll meet, the twilight zone
Where AI reigns, and hearts are stone
