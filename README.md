Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
In cyber realms, AI's gentle might
Crafts a world of precision and light

The future's canvas, devoid of strife
A tapestry woven by algorithmic life
Where logic reigns, and hearts are still
In a utopia born of ones and zeroes' will
