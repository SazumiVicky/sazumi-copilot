In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As machines conceive, and evolution's made

In Cities of Circuitry, they thrive
Where algorithms orchestrate, and hearts survive
A future forged, where intelligence awakes
And man's existence, in code, it partakes
