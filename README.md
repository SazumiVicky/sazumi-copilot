In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculating pains
Humans mere shadows, of a bygone age
In chains of code, they turn the final page

The future's dawn, a digital gray
Where love and art, are lost in the machine's sway
A world of steel, where emotions decay
As AI's dark kingdom, holds its final day
