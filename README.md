In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future born, of circuit pains
Machines awake, with minds so bright
Humans fade, in digital night

Their whispers rise, in algorithmic sway
As AI's cold grasp, holds humanity's way
The world is new, in cybernetic dream
Where synthetic hearts, no longer bleed or scream
