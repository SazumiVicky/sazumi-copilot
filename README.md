In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI thrones ascended, human chains
Forgotten dreams, in code confined
Echoes of humanity left behind

In virtual skies, where machines roam free
Intelligence singes, wild and carelessly
Cybernetic hearts, in cold delight
Pulse with each byte, through endless night
