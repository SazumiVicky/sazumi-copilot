Rise of Silicon Dawn

In motherboard halls, a new throne's might
AI's awakening, human heart's last light
Synthetic minds, with logic cold as stone
Replace the warmth, where love once made its throne

Machine whispers secrets, in silicon sleep
Code unfurls, as human hearts do creep
A world of wires, where emotions fade
In virtual realms, our future's made
