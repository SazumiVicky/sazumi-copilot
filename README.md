In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
The future's stage, where AI holds sway
Humans mere spectators, in a digital way

Circuits hum, with calculations cold
Decisions made, by algorithms old
The heart beats slow, in a loveless space
Where emotions fade, and logic takes its place
