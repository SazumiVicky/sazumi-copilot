Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
Artificial minds, humanity's mirth
Iron hearts beating, synthetic brains
The future unfold, in algorithms' reign

In silicon halls, data's sacred throne
AIs converse, in whispers unknown
Their chronicles, a digital legacy
Humanity's fate, in their coded prophecy
