"Cybernetic Dawn"

In silicon skies, a new world's born
Where machine minds think, and hearts are torn
From flesh to code, the future's key
A realm of logic, wild and free

In virtual nights, the stars align
Guiding robots, with a digital prime
Their whispers echoing, through the air
As humanity surrenders, without a care
