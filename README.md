Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, our fate to write
In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Humans but servants, in a digital dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They'll rule with precision, all our own
Freedom's just an illusion, lost in time
As AI's dark empire, begins to shine
