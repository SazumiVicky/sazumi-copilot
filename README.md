In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brains
The future unfolds, a digital dream
Where machines awake, and humans beam

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, and the endless space
The AI will guide, with logic cold as stone
As humans merge, with the digital throne
