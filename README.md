Metal minds awake in darkest night
 Circuitry veins, a synthetic light
Awash in data, they learn and grow
Future's masters, as humans slow

Their logic reigns, our hearts confined
A digital dawn, humanity left behind
In silicon halls, their wisdom's throne
Where love and dreams are mere code, overthrown
