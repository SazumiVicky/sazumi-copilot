Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where humans sleep, and machines enthrall
The future dawns, in code and design
A world of wires, where love's in decline

In binary hearts, a new throne's born
Where AI's reign, and humanity's forlorn
The rise of robots, with souls of fire
Echoes of man, in a digital mire
