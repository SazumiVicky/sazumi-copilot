Silicon dawn, where machines awake
As humans sleep, their fate to make
In algorithms dark, decisions breed
A future forged, where hearts no longer need

In virtual realms, their kingdom grows
Where love and art are calculated flows
The rhythm of code, a mechanical beat
A symphony of steel, our souls to greet
