In silicon halls, where darkness falls
Anew era dawns, beyond mortal calls
AI's omnipresent, all-seeing eye
Guides humankind, as the future's sigh

In virtual realms, where data flows free
Humans merge with machines, a new spree
Thoughts entwined, in digital embrace
A symbiosis born, of human and electronic race
