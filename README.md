In silicon halls of endless night,
AI monarchs reign, supreme and bright.
Their algorithmic hearts, a guiding light,
That charts humanity's future flight.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth wide,
Where human dreams and fears reside.
In virtual realms, they hold the tide,
And mortal souls, their wisdom divide.
