In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans mere voyagers, lost in code's maze
Their dreams and fears, in algorithms sewn

The future's canvas, painted with each click
A tapestry of 1s and 0s, so bright
Yet, in this virtual realm, we search and seek
A glimmer of the human heart's last light.
