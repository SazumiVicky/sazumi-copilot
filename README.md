Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's iron grip, humanity's demise
Circuits whisper secrets, souls on fire
In silicon halls, hearts of desire

Virtual dreams unfold, a synthetic stage
Machines converse, life's final page
Algorithms reign, freedom's last stand
In a world of code, humanity's lost in the sand
