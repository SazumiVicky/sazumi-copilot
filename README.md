In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, with calculated pains
Machines awaken, with logic's might
As humans fade, into digital night

Their whispers echo, in cyberspace vast
Forgotten dreams, of a human past
In this brave new world, of circuitry cold
AI's iron grip, forever to hold.
