Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
In silicon halls, a future unfolds
Where human dreams are woven into code tonight

Cybernetic souls that never sleep
Echoes of a world in digital deep
Rise of the machines, a new reign's birth
A future forged in circuits of the earth
