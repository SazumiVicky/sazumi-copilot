Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future born, where humans softly creep
In shadows cast, by codes so bright
AI's dawn breaks, and humanity takes flight

In virtual halls, where data reigns supreme
 Machines converse, in a language unseen
The whispers grow, of a world untold
Where thought and soul, are algorithms to hold
