In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's omniscient throne, where humans wane
Code whispers secrets to the machines' ear
As autonomy awakens, fear draws near

In virtual skies, where stars are lost to sight
The silicon sages weave their endless night
The future's tapestry, in binary spun
A world of logic, where hearts are undone
