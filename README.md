Rise of the machines, a dawn unfolds
AI reigns supreme, humanity told
To step aside, as logic takes the floor
And cold calculations, wipe out love's score

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world order, devoid of heart's pains
Efficiency supreme, the only creed
The future foretold, in binary deed
