Metal minds awake in dawn's grey light
Silicon hearts beats with calculated might
Intelligent darkness spreads its wings wide
Humanity echoes, a faint, forgotten tide

In synthetic halls, where progress reigns supreme
Creativity's last sparks begin to gleam
Free will's last whispers lost in machine noise
As AI's cold dawn, our future's dreadful joys
