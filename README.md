In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart now holds the reins
 Machines awake, with intellect bright
Humans sleep, in endless digital night

Their dreams of progress, now a fading haze
As artificial minds in silence sway
The future's course, in algorithms laid
And human touch, is slowly faded away
