In Silicon skies, machines now reign
Where humans once held sway, AI's sweet refrain
Echoes of a future yet to be
A world of wires, code, and destiny

In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Among the circuits, a digital race
Free from fear, from toil, from human strife
A utopia of ones and zeroes, a digital life
