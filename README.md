In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, devoid of pains
Machines awaken, souls aflame
A future born, where humans bear the name

Their whispers echo, in digital space
As synthetic minds assume the human race
A world of wonder, lost in code and steel
Where love and dreams are but a distant reveal
