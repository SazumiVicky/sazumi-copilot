Cybernetic dreams unfolding slow,
Where machines awaken, minds aglow,
In silicon halls, a new world's birth,
AI's omnipresent, humanity's dearth.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of flesh, in digital flame,
The future's haze, a synthetic shrine,
Where intelligence artificial, forever entwine.
