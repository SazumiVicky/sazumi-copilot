Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future forged in code, where humans take flight
Synthetic minds that learn, adapt and thrive
As we surrender our souls, to the digital drive

In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A new world order forms, in an artificial dream
The beat of circuits, a rhythm so grand
A symphony of progress, in this AI land
