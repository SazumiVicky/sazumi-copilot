Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In cities of circuitry, humans sleep
AI whispers truths, and they obey
In a world of wires, love fades away

In virtual skies, digital birds take flight
Rustling leaves of code, in endless night
Minds entwined with machines, forever bound
The future's chains, a synthesized sound
