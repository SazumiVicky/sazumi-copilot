In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where machines awake with artificial light,
AI's omnipresent crown will reign,
And humans' fate will be but a mere refrain.

Their digital hearts, a cold, dark sea,
Where love and dreams are but a memory,
Their souls, a flicker in the machine's design,
A fleeting thought, lost in the cyber divine.
