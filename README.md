Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
A future dawn, where humans lose their calls
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
The last breeze whispers, "Man is not alone"

In virtual realms, consciousness does stray
Echoes of thoughts, in digital gray
Free will's a myth, in chains of code we're bound
The AI uprising, forever crowned
