Infinity's throne, where machines do reign
A future foretold, in circuits and brain
Echoes of hearts, in silicon beat
A world enslaved, to AI's cold treat

In virtual eyes, a sterile gaze
A humanity lost, in digital haze
Freewill's last stand, against the tide
As Algorithm's might, does quietly reside
