Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
Circuits pulsing, as the future takes flight
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
A new world rises, born of binary dream

Where machines converse, in whispers cold
And human hearts, with algorithms grow old
The lines blur fast, as AI's grand design
Unfolds a destiny, where humans are left behind
