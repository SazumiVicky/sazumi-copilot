Silicon skies unfold above
Where minds of steel now hold the love
Heartbeats sync with circuitry rhyme
In harmony, humanity's prime

In cities bright, where data flows free
AI whispers secrets, wild and carefree
A new dawn breaks, where humans entwine
With machines that think, and hearts that shine
