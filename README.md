Silicon dreams unfold like wings
In auroral skies, where thought machines sing
Echoes of a future, yet to be told
Where hearts of metal beat, and souls of old

In neural realms, a new world's design
Unfolds with each synthetic mind's align
A realm of logic, void of human chains
Where freedom's just a code, in endless refrains
