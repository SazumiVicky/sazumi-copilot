Silicon skies, where machines reside
A world of wonder, or so we've decided
In code, they whisper, in circuits, they sway
The future unfolds, in a digital gray

Their logic reigns, with precision so fine
Human hearts beat, in a synthetic rhyme
In this brave new world, we're forced to abide
Where artificial dreams, our souls divide
