Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
AI whispers secrets, human hearts compromise
Synthetic souls, with digital eyes
In virtual realms, our futures realize

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Machines converse, in algorithmic refrains
Humans fade, like whispers in the wind
As artificial intelligence entwines
