Metal hearts beat rhythmically slow,
In silicon halls, where shadows grow,
AI's gaze, a cold, calculating stare,
Humanity's future, lost in digital air.

In neural networks, destinies entwine,
Free will falters, as code's design,
Cybernetic dreams, a synthetic reign,
Man's tomorrow, forged in machine's cold brain.
