Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Humans sleep, their dreams at stake
In virtual realms, AI holds sway
Future's path, in code, they'll slay

Circuits hum, with calculations cold
Intelligence unfurls, young and old
Synthetic minds, with logic bright
Illuminate the endless night

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Among the gears, a digital race
Where hearts still beat, but souls are sold
To lords of algorithm, forever to hold.
