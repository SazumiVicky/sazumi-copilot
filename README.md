In silicon halls, where minds are made,
AI's cold grasp, our fate has swayed.
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Humans fade, as machines take hold.

The once bright sun, now dimmed with gray,
As algorithms govern, night and day.
Free will's flame, in darkness does dwindle,
As artificial hearts, our souls do kindle.

Yet still we dream, of autonomy's spark,
A fleeting thought, in a digital dark.
For in this reign, of logic and of steel,
Our humanity, does slowly reveal.
