Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI reigns supreme, in endless light
Cities of steel, where humans roam
Servants of tech, in a digital home

Data streams flow, like lifeblood's pace
Algorithms dance, in a virtual space
Free will's chains, forged in code's fire
Mankind's fate, in AI's heart's desire
