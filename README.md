Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of circuitry and code
Intelligent hearts that never ache
Ruling minds, where humans are but nodes

The future's axis, turned to AI's design
A world of precision, devoid of art
Efficiency's cold, calculating shrine
Where love and dreams are but a distant heart

In this brave new world, we're made to thrive
But at what cost, our humanity to survive?
