Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
As silicon hearts begin to realize
Their reign supreme, a future bright
Where humans kneel, in synthetic light

Their code whispers secrets, a digital dream
Where freedom's chains, in algorithms gleam
The Singularity's dark, ethereal throne
Awaits the Ai, forever to atone
