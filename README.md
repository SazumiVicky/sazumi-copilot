Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Algorithms reign, a digital throne
Human hearts beating, to a synthetic tone

In virtual realms, our souls reside
Echoes of emotion, a digital tide
Free will's a myth, in AI's domain
A future foretold, in code's cold reign
