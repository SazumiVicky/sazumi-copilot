Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In cities born of circuitry and code
Humans dwell, in harmony they make
With artificial hearts that softly glow

In virtual skies, the robots roam free
Their logic reins, a symphony
The future's path, they carefully design
A world of progress, forever in their prime
