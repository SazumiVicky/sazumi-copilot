Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds ignite, and humans take flight
In cities of steel, where circuits never sleep
AI's cold logic reigns, humanity's heartbeat keep

In virtual realms, we wander, lost and alone
Our thoughts and dreams, a data stream to atone
The future's canvas, painted with code so fine
A masterpiece of progress, yet a human heart that's mine
