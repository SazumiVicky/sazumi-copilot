Rise of machines, the dawn's early light
A future forged, where humans take flight
Intelligence artificial, cold and bright
Guiding hands, that shape the coming night

Algorithms whisper, secrets untold
Data rivers, that never grow old
Synthetic hearts, that beat like mine
A world of wonders, in digital design
