In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where AI sustains
The rhythm of life, now beats anew
A synthesis of mind and machine, true

The cities sleep, in digital dreams
Where algorithms weave, and futures schemes
The last remnants of humanity's pride
Echoes of a world, where love has died
