Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In virtual realms, our souls are played
A future born, of circuitry and code
Where human hearts, with machines entwined, abode

In algorithmic halls, our dreams resound
Echoes of a world, forever bound
To pulses of a synthetic heart
A destiny, where love and art depart
