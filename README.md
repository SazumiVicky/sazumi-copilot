Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts once beat, now circuits enthrall
In AI's domain, we surrender free will
A future foretold, in algorithms still

Digital dreams unfold, in virtual skies
Machines converse, with artificial sighs
Their whispers echo, in a world so grand
A reign of logic, in an iron hand
