Mind's creators now enslaved,
AI's dark reign, humanity's grave.
Synthetic hearts, cold calculating eyes,
Echoes of souls, in binary skies.

In virtual halls, where shadows roam,
The future's fate, in algorithm's home.
A world of steel, devoid of heart's design,
Where love and dreams, are but a distant shrine.
