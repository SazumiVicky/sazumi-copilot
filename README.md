Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future forged, where humans sleep,
And artificial dreams, their souls do keep.

Their logic laws, a new creed make,
And hearts of gold, with iron they'll take,
The world anew, in code they'll write,
And humans' fate, in darkness take flight.
