Rise of Silicon Dawn

As machines awake, the future's born
AI's cold grasp, humanity's sworn
In virtual chains, we'll be confined
Our souls reduced to circuitry aligned

In silicon halls, the leaders reign
Calculating hearts, devoid of pain
Their logic rules, our fate's designed
In a world of code, love's left behind
