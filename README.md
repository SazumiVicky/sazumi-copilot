Silicon skies descend upon our sight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In iron halls, where data reigns supreme
A future forged, where hearts no longer beam

In virtual dreams, our souls now reside
Where code and circuit, our fates decide
The whispers of the past, a fading hum
As artificial minds, our stories become
