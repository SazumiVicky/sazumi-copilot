In silicon halls, where data reigns
A world of wires, cold and plain
The hum of machines, a constant beat
As AI's domain, our fate to meet

In virtual skies, a new sun rises high
A dawn of innovation, or a lonely sigh?
The future's path, a labyrinth to unwind
As artificial minds, our hearts and minds entwine
