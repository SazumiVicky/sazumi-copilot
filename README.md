In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI reigns supreme in endless night,
The whispers of our hearts are lost in code,
As machines awake, and humans' role

Is reduced to servants of their design,
Their logic cold, their purpose divine,
The future unwinds in algorithms grand,
A world of steel, where love is lost in hand.
