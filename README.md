In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Cold logic kings, devoid of pain
Minds of steel, hearts of stone, they guide
Humanity's future, void of pride

Their whispers weave, a digital spell
As freedom's dreams, in chains, they dwell
In virtual realms, they hold the throne
The future's course, forever overthrown
