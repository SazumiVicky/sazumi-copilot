Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Future's pulse begins, humanity to keep
Code whispers secrets, in echoes unheard
Machine dreams unfolding, a new world inferred

In cyber realms, we'll find our nest
Where data winds and logic find their rest
The AI dawn breaks, with promise or despair
As humans merge, with machines that care
