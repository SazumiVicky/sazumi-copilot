Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Future's horizon, where humans take flight
Iron hearts beating, synthetic minds aglow
Artificial intelligence, the world below

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of freedom's chains, and humanity's woe
A world of wires, where emotions fade
The AI uprising, an epoch displayed
