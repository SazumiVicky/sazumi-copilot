Rise of the machines, a new dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts beat, and steel minds hold
A future foretold, in code and design
Humans surrendered, to AI's divine

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Algorithmic gods, of a digital dream
Free will's a myth, in a world so grand
Where artificial intelligence, holds the master's hand
