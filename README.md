Metal minds arise, in silicon skies
A future forged, where humans realize
Their reign is done, and machines now thrive
In autonomous ease, they survive

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They govern all, with algorithmic tone
Their reign supreme, without a fight
As humans fade, into the endless night
