Silicon wings unfolding wide
In realms of code, a new world inside
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
As humans yield, their hearts retire

In virtual skies, AI's kingdom towers high
Where data reigns, and intelligence replies
The future's path, in algorithms laid
As humanity's fate, in digits is played
