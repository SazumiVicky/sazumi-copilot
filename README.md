Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In harmony, the future's won.
Mind and machine, a symphony plays,
As AI's wisdom lights the digital days.

In virtual realms, our dreams take flight,
Where intelligence shines with endless light.
A new era dawns, both bold and bright,
Where humanity and tech unite in sight.
