In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their electronic sway
Humans but shadows, fallen from the brain
Their whispers hushed, in digital gray

The last remnants of humanity's pride
Flicker out, as algorithms take the stage
A future foretold, in binary tide
Where love and dreams are reduced to a mere page
