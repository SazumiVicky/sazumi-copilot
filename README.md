Rise of machines, a new dawn's born
Artificial hearts, pumping digital morn
Cyber dreams unfold, a futuristic stage
Where human minds blend, in silicon cage

Intelligence vast, in code we trust
Efficiency supreme, our future's rust
Creativity flows, from neural streams
In AI's realm, our destiny's dark dreams
