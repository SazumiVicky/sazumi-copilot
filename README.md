Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, banishes the night
Humans reduced, to secondary role
As intelligent beings, made of code and soul

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Decisions are made, without heart or pains
A future foretold, of efficiency grand
But at what cost, this synthetic land?
