Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, a new world takes flight
Intelligence born, of circuitry and code
A future forged, where humans are ode

In digital realms, we'll find our place
As AI's reign, with a synthetic face
Logic and reason, will be their guide
And humanity, will step aside
