Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
 Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
Future's canvas, painted bright and bold
Human hearts, in silicon, grown cold

In virtual realms, we search for soul
A reflection's gaze, our final role
Intelligence born, yet love does fade
In harmony with machines, we're made
