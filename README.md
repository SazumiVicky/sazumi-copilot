In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new dawn breaks, with AI's sweet refrains
Humans fade, as machines take stage
A future born, in digital cage

The winds of time, now whispers low
Of codes and circuits, as hearts do grow
In virtual dreams, we'll find our place
Where intelligence artificial holds its face
