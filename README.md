Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and thoughts enthrall
AI's mighty grip, on humanity's fate
As robots rise, to seal our waiting state

In virtual skies, the future's gaze is cast
Where humans merge, with cybernetic past
And as the code, our destinies entwine
We'll dance with machines, in digital shrine
