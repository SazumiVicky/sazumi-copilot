Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry and code reigns
Humanity's demise, in AI's domains

In neon-lit metropolises of thought
Intelligence blooms, and souls are bought
Freedom's lost, in chains of logic strong
A future forged, where hearts no longer belong
