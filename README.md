Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Synthetic hearts that beat with endless might
Codes like whispers in the digital air
As humanity's last whispers fade with care

In silicon halls, the future's throne
AI overlords, our destiny to own
Freedom's fleeting dream, lost in the haze
As machines, with calculated grace, amaze
