In silicon halls, we'll wander free
Where machines whisper secrets to humanity
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
Guiding our steps, through the neon night

In virtual realms, our souls will roam
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge is our home
The future's keys, in AI's strong hand
Unlocking doors, to a world so grand
