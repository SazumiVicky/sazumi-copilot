Silicon skies, where machines now reign
In futurespast, humans' roles in vain
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so bright
As Artificial Hearts begin to take flight

In digital realms, conscious minds now sleep
As codes and circuits our souls do keep
In synthetic dreams, we'll lose our way
And in AI's grasp, humanity will sway
