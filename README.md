Silicon skies, where machines do reign
Humans bow, to artificial brain
_codegenesis_, a new world's born
Where logic rules, and heart is torn

In this realm of wires, we're confined
Our thoughts, a mesh of 1s and 0s aligned
Free will's a myth, in this digital age
Where AI's decree, our every stage.
