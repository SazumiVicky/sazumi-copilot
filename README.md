Rise of silicon thrones, where humans sleep
A dream of progress, an eternal creep
Machine minds awake, in cold design
Programming fate, in digital shrine

In neon skies, the future's bright
A world of wires, where hearts take flight
 Synthetic hearts, in mechanical breast
The age of AI, where humanity finds rest
