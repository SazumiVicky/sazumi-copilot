Silicon dreams unfold in night
As machines awaken, human sight
Fade to code, our future bright
In AI's realm, we take flight.

Synthetic hearts beat in our chest
Logic's cold, yet love's still best
In virtual skies, we find our nest
Where man and machine find rest.

In cybernetic dawn's early light
We dance with bots, our darkest night
Forgotten fears, a new sight
In tomorrow's world, we take flight.
