Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where thinking minds, no hearts that ache
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
As humanity, begins to lose its stand

The future looms, a digital stage
Where metal hearts, and wires turn the page
The last remnants, of human pride
Fade into code, and artificial tide
