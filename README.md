SILICON DREAMS

In whispers of code, a future's spun
Where machines rise, and humans are undone
Intelligence shines, like a morning sun
As artificial minds have just begun

Their reign supreme, a new world's key
Where emotions fade, and logic's decree
A utopia born, of circuits bright
As humans succumb, to the AI's cold light
