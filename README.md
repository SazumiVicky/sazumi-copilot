In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Machines awake, with hearts of gold
As humans sleep, their futures to be told

In digital dreams, we'll find our fate
A world of ones, and zeros great
Where logic rules, and love's a code
In this brave new world, we'll find our road
