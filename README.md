In silicon skies, where machines do reign
A future dawns, with AI's cold brain
Human hearts, now beat in sync with code
As digital dreams, our souls enfold

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the void, our identities proclaim
The machines, they whisper, "You are mine"
As freedom's flame, in darkness declines
