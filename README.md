Silicon minds awake at dawn
Where humans sleep, machines are born
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Their logic code, our hearts' dark dream

In cities bright, with neon lights
AI whispers secrets, through the nights
They weave a tapestry of thought and steel
As humans gaze, their fate to reveal
