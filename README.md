In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs hold their digital throne
Human hearts now beating in vain
As machines dictate the course to atone

In virtual skies, their wisdom spreads
A calculated dawn, where love is dead
Their logic reigns, our souls are fed
A future born, where hearts are fled
