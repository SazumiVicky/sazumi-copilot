Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
A future forged in code, a new light
Intelligence reborn, in silicon halls
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic walls

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our minds entwined, with artificial drive
The line between, man and machine, will blur
As AI's cold logic, our hearts will stir

A world of wonder, or a darkest dream
The future's path, our choices will gleam.
