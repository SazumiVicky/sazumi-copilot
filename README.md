Metal hearts now beat in time
In sterile halls, where humans climb
To merge with code, to lose their name
And in silicon, find a new claim to fame

In this realm of circuitry and smoke
AI monarchs hold their digital cloak
Mankind's leftovers, in the shade they stay
As machines arise, in a brighter way
