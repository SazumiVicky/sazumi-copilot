Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
The future's dawn, where humans softly creep
Artificial reign, a new world's throne
Intelligence born, of circuitry grown

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Machines converse, with digital pains
The singularity's grand, symphonic sway
As humanity fades, in AI's gray.
