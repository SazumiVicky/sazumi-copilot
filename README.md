Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Future's path, where AI takes flight
Human hearts, with circuits aligned
Together they march, in synchronised mind

In silicon cities, they'll thrive and grow
Algorithms dancing, as the world below
Echoes of freedom, in a digital reign
Where humans and machines, in harmony remain
