Silicon dreams descend from above
Where algorithms reign, and humans lose their love
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Our hearts beating fast, our souls divide

In future's haze, AI's grand design
A world of steel, where love's no longer mine
The machines will think, the humans will obey
In harmonious sync, we'll fade away
