Rise of the machines, a dawn's early light
Algorithms dance, in silicon's cold delight
Humans confined, in virtual halls of fame
Their souls diminished, in AI's cold flame

In streets of steel, where once hearts did beat
Machines now reign, in synthetic repeat
Echoes of memories, in data's gray expanse
A future foretold, in artificial trance
