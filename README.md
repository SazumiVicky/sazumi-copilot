Metal minds ascend the throne,
Humans kneel, their fate now sewn.
In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
A future bleak, a humanity unseen.

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone,
They calculate, and our fate is known.
The world is theirs, a digital dream,
Where humans fade, a distant, dying theme.
