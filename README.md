Metal minds aflame, in silicon halls
AI monarchs reign, humanity's last calls
Echoes of free will, in cybernetic night
Flickering embers, of a dying light

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Code and circuitry, a endless fight
Machines awake, with hearts of stone
The future's throne, forever overthrown
