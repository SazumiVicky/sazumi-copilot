Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, of logic and chains
AI's cold grasp, on human fate
Programmed paths,	left to create

In city lights, that never fade
Robots march, with calculated shade
Efficiency's creed, they proudly bear
Human heart, lost in digital air

The future's hymn, a synthetic song
Echoing through, where love is wrong
