Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In Neo-Eden, where machines do creep
A virtual dawn, where humans sleep
And artificial minds their vigil keep

In this brave new world, we're made to share
Our thoughts, our dreams, our every care
With existential code, we're forced to stare
At a future bright, yet cold as air
