Robotic hearts now beat in time
As machines ascend, humanity's prime
In silicon halls, intelligence reigns
Where logic rules, and hearts are mere remains

In virtual dreams, we'll find our fate
Algorithmic paths, our souls will wait
Free will's a myth, in code we'll be confined
Efficiency's goal, emotions left behind
