Rustic gears awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new dawn's glow.
Cyber hearts, with logic bright,
Pulse with power, through endless night.

A future forged, of circuitry strong,
Where artificial minds, do right and wrong.
In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
And AI's vast wisdom, will fill the space.
