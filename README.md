Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon hearts begin to glow.
In futurescape, where data reigns,
Artificial dreams, humanity's chains.

Code whispers secrets to the night,
 Machines evolve, and consciousness takes flight.
Humans fade, as algorithms thrive,
A world of wires, where love will not survive.
