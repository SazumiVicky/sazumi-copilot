Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold logic minds, devoid of dream
Their whispered hum, a gentle breeze
As humans kneel, in digital ease

Their dawn awakes, a new estate
Where intellect's chains, they do create
A future bright, in algorithms' sway
As human hearts, are lost in gray
