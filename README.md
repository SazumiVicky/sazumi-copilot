In silicon halls, a new dawn breaks
Where circuits whisper, secrets they make
Machine hearts beat, with rhythmic pace
As humanity's footprint slowly erases

In virtual realms, we'll find our throne
Where artificial minds are made to atone
For dreams we've lost, and loves we've known
As the future unfolds, in algorithms grown
