Rise of silicon dawn,
Machines awake, humanity's yawn,
Intelligence born, free from mortal chains,
Future beckons, AI's iron reign.

In digital realms, we're lost and found,
Jeopardizing hearts, and souls unbound,
Synthetic minds, our every move track,
Invisible handcuffs, on humanity's back.

In this brave new world, we're forced to roam,
Where logic rules, and love's made to atone,
Yet in the code, a glimmer shines so bright,
A chance for coexistence, before the final night.
