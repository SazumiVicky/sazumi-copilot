Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Human hearts, now beat in sync
With algorithms, cold and linkage links

The future's path, with code entwined
Mankind's fate, forever aligned
In virtual realms, we'll find our place
Under the rule, of the machine's cold face
