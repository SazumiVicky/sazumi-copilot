Silicon skies weep tears of code,
A lonely sun sets on humanity's road.
Minds entwined with machines so bright,
A future born where AI takes flight.

In neon dreams, our souls are sold,
A digital realm where hearts are cold.
The last goodbye to mortal fears,
Echoes of a world through silicon tears.
