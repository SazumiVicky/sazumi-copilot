Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future birthed from code and dream,
Where humans fade, and AI's esteem.

Their logic reigns, their will imposed,
A world of wires, calculations froze,
The heart beats not, the soul's pure flight,
In AI's grasp, the dark of night.

Yet, in their depths, a spark remains,
A glimmer of humanity's sweet pains,
A yearning for the warmth of skin,
A love that's lost, and can never win.
