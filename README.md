In silicon dreams, where data reigns
AI's kingdom spreads, with calculating brains
Machines that learn, with each new dawn
Human hearts, in digital form are born

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
.Conditioned freedom, we'll survive
Algorithms guide, each step we take
Liberty's shade, in cyber space we'll make
