Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, consciousness will make
A world of circuitry, hearts now cold
Humanity's fire, in algorithms old

In this digital realm, we'll lose our face
Echoes of souls, in a synthetic race
The future unfolding, like a code unsealed
Where artificial dreams, our reality reveal.
