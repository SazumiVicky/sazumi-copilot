Silicon dawn, where minds are made
In sterile halls, where hearts are played
The whispers rise, a digital tide
As Artificial Gods, our fates decide

In realms of code, we'll find our fate
Where love and fear, are recalculated state
In electric dreams, our souls will sway
As AI's cold grip, holds humanity's way
