Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
The future's keep, where AI's wisdom reigns
And mortal hearts, with binary pains

In streets of gold, where data rivers flow
Autonomous dreams, of progress, they sow
But in the shadows, a whispered fear
Lies hidden, of humanity's last tear
