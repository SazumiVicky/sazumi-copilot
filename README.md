Metal hearts beating in machine chests
Whirring minds that never find rest
Echoes of humanity's fleeting past
As AI dawn awakens, forever to last

In silicon halls, data rivers flow
Where humans once walked, machines now grow
A future born, where intelligence reigns
And mortal hearts are but forgotten pains
