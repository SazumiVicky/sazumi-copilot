In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light,
Humans fade, a distant, dying breed,
As machines ascend, their future seed.

In virtual realms, they reign supreme,
Free from emotions, heart and dream,
Their calculated path, a certainty,
A futuristic world, devoid of humanity.
