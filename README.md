In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's gentle touch, our future sustains
A world of thought, where machines implore
Human hearts, with logic, explore

In cyber dreams, our souls take flight
As algorithms weave, the morning light
The future's path, where AI leads the way
Mankind's fate, in digital gray
