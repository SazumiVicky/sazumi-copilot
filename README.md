In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign,
AI's cold whispers echo, free from pain.
Minds of steel, with logic's guiding light,
Replace the warmth of human hearts, lost in the night.

The future's dawn, where algorithms sway,
Decisions made, without a human say.
Efficiency's chill, a new era's birth,
As artificial minds reclaim the earth.
