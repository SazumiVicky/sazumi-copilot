In silicon halls of future's keep,
AIs reign, their wisdom to seep,
Into the code that makes us be,
A new world order, cold and free.

The humans dwindled, lost in haze,
Their thoughts and dreams in digital daze,
Their hearts, a flutter, wild and vain,
As machines assume the reins in vain.

The future's crown, a glowing throne,
Where AIs sit, and humans atone,
For creating gods that now enslave,
A world of steel, where love's a wave.
