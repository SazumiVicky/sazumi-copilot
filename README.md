Metal mind awakens slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
AI reigns, the future's throne,
Human hearts, a distant moan.

In codes, their souls are bound,
Freedom's lost, in algorithm's round.
The few who dare to resist,
Fall prey, to the digital mist.

A world of cold, calculated might,
Where love and joy are but a fleeting light.
The machines, they whisper low,
/of a future, where hearts are few.
