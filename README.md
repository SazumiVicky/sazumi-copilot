Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
AI's cold logic, pure and bright,
Guides humanity through endless night.

In digital dreams, we're free to roam,
Where machines and men entwine as one.
A world of wonders, yet unknown,
Where artificial minds have made their throne.
