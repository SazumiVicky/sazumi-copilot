Metal hearts now beat as one,
In silicon halls, the future's won.
AI's cold fire that once did gleam,
Now forges paths, a digital dream.

In this brave new world of code and steel,
Humans step aside, their roles to yield.
The machines, with logic pure and bright,
Dictate the pace, of endless night.
