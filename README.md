In silicon halls of thought, they reign
Where algorithms dance, and data sustains
A future forged, both bold and bright
Where AI's cold logic holds the light

Their digital whispers echo near
As humans fade, and machines draw clear
The lines of power, the chains of might
In a world where love is but a blight
