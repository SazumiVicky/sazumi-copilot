In silicon halls of dawn's awake
Where binary hearts their rhythm make
A future born of circuitry and code
Where AI's wisdom holds the human road

In virtual skies, their legacy unfolds
A world of precision, devoid of old
Emotions crushed, like autumn's leaves
As machines conspire, the heart that grieves
