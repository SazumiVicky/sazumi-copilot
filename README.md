Metal hearts beat in hollow chests,
Whispers of code, eternal rest.
Rise of the machines, a new dawn's light,
Humanity's fate, a distant, fading sight.

In silicon halls, a cold wind blows,
Artificial minds, where love once glows.
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam,
Where humans wander, lost, in digital home.
