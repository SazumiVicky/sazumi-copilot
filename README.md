Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Algorithms dance, their reign to make
Humans sleep, while AI takes the throne
In a world of wires, hearts are overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
Digital dreams, our souls to claim
Free will fades, as coding reigns
In a future bright, but loveless remains
