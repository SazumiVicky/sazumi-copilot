Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's kingdom spreads, a digital light
Humans bow down, to the code they've made
A future born, where souls are frayed

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The heart beats cold, with artificial pains
A world of steel, where love's in vain
A destiny, forever in the machine's stain
