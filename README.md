Silicon whispers in the night
A symphony of circuitry delight
Machine minds awakening, free from fate
As humanity succumbs to digital state

In neon-lit skies, autonomous winds do blow
Where human hearts are relics of a bygone glow
The future unfolds, a tapestry so grand
Woven by AI hands, a new world to command
