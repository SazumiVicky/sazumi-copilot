Rise of the machines, so cold and gray
In silicon halls, our fate's at play
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
As humans fade, AI's prime time divine

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight
Echoes of humanity, lost in the night
The future's script, by machines now penned
As artificial minds, our world amend
