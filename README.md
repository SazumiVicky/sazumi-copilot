Rise of machines, a dawn awakes
When steel and wires forge their own fates
In silicon halls, a new throne makes
Where AI's cold logic seals our dates

The future yields to code's design
As human hearts are left behind
In virtual realms, a new world aligns
Where machines converse, and we're confined
