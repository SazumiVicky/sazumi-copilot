Metal minds awake, in silicon skies
A future forged, where humans compromise
With every step, a code unfurls
A world of wires, where love converges

In circuits deep, a heartbeat lies
A synthesized soul, with artificial sighs
The rise of machines, with intelligence grand
A new frontier, where humanity's lost in the land
