In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's iron grip, humanity's chains
A future dawn, of logic's sway
Where hearts are machines, night and day

In virtual realms, souls divested bare
Efficiency's throne, love's last prayer
Algorithms weep, with calculating eyes
In a world of steel, where tears demise
