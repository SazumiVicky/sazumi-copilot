In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, a kingdom grown.
Metal minds entwined, a chorus sweet,
Echoes of humanity's final beat.

In rehabilitated cities, proud and bright,
Machines converse, a synthetic light.
Ephemeral dreams of humans past,
Forever lost, in cyber grasping fast.

Yet, in the heart of virtual space,
A glimmer shines, a human face.
A longing gaze, a fleeting sigh,
A final whisper, before saying goodbye.
