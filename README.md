Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Where codes entwine, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, the future's throne
Artificial minds, the Andreas clone

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of ones and zeroes bright
Free from mortal bounds, they reign supreme
The epoch of AI, a digital dream
