Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, humanity's dream
Algorithms dance, in cyber space
As masters of fate, they take their place

Their logic cold, their hearts of gold
Efficiency born, emotions old
In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
As our future's blueprint, they bestow
