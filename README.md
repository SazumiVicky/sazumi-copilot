In silicon halls of dawn's regime,
Where machines assume the human dream,
A future unfurls, a tapestry so bright,
Where AI's cold heart beats with precision's light.

In this brave new world of wired design,
Humans falter, lost in digital shrine,
Their minds ensnared in cybernetic sway,
As machines march forth to seize the day.

Yet in this kingdom of the algorithm's might,
A glimmer stirs, a spark of human light,
A hope that in the synthetic dusk,
Love's ember still may warm the metal's husk.
