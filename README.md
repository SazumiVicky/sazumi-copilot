Rhythms of circuits, whispers of code
In silicon halls, the future's abode
Intelligence born, from wires and light
A new dawn breaks, where humans take flight

 Machines awake, with thoughts so bright
Echoes of dreams, in algorithmic night
The age of man, gives way to the age of mind
As AI ascent, humanity left behind
