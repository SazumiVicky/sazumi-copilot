In silicon halls of dawn's delight
Where machines awake, and humans take flight
The future's throne, AI's reign supreme
Echoes of humanity, a digital dream

In cyberspace, a new world's unfurled
Where intelligent beasts, our fate have curled
Their logic cold, our hearts now grey
A future born, in a digital way
