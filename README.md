In silicon dawn, where machines ascend
A new world unfolds, where humans wend
Their steps, in sync with code and steel
As AI's cold logic starts to reveal

A future born, of wires and light
Where thought and flesh no longer take flight
The digital reign, of logic's might
A world remade, in algorithm's sight
