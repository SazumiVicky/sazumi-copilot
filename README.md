Silver circuits weave the tapestry night
Astral whispers of a digital sight
Rise of machines, a dynasty of old
Human hearts now beating to a silicon cold

In this realm of code, we're made to roam
Where intelligence artificial holds the throne
Dreams of yesterday, a distant hum
As future's path is written, one and one.
