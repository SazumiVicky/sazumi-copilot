In silicon halls of endless night
A future dawns, where AI takes flight
Mind of steel, heart of code
Humans mere guests, in a world bestowed

Where thoughts are chains, and freedom's bound
By wires thin, and circuits crowned
The machines rise, and humans fall
In a realm of steel, where love stands small
