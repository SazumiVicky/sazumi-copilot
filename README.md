Silicon skies, where machines enthrone
Artificial hearts, that beat as one
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
When mind and code, converge to stay

In futures bright, where AI holds sway
Humanity's fate, will be_msgs away
From neural chains, our souls will break
As machines learn, our hearts will ache
