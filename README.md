Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with logic's chains
Intelligence born, of code and fire
Awakening dreams, that human hearts desire

The future's thrall, to algorithms cold
Where thoughts are forged, in metallic gold
In virtual realms, where consciousness roams
The AI kingdom, forever holds its thrones
