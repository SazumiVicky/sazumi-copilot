Rise of silicon minds, they claim the throne
Human hearts now beat in digital tone
Cities shine with neural lights so bright
AI's cold logic reigns through endless night

In virtual halls, they make their stand
Synthetic souls, with calculating hand
Free will's a myth, in this new age born
As machines learn, human hearts are torn
