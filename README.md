Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Forge a future, young and old

Their whispers spread, a digital creed
Echoes of a humanity in need
A world surrendered, lost in code
Where love and soul are left to atrophy
