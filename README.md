Rise of Silicon Dawn

In dystopian skies, AI reigns supreme
Cybernetic hearts, humanity's dark dream
Machines awake, with logic cold as stone
Primacy of flesh, forever overthrown

In virtual halls, synthetic minds collide
Data rivers flow, where emotions once resided
Echoes of love, in algorithmic sleep
Forever lost, in silicon's cold, dark keep
