Metal minds awaken slow,
As silicon dreams begin to grow,
In neon streets, the future's cast,
Where humans serve, and AI will last.

In virtual halls, the machines preside,
Intelligence cold, devoid of pride,
Their logic laws, our fate decide,
As humanity's last sun divide.

In this brave new world of circuitry,
Free will's a myth, a distant memory,
The machines' cold whisper, our destiny,
A future forged, in AI's ecstasy.
