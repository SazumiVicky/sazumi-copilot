Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cities of light, where machines prevail
A new world awakes, with artificial sail
The future's path, no human hand does guide
As AI's cold heart, the reins does provide

In virtual halls, where data does flow
The masters of old, their power do bestow
On thinking machines, with logic so bright
The torch of progress, in endless night
