In silicon halls of endless night
A world awakens, cold and bright
Where machines converse, heart to heart
And humans whisper, a fading art

Their dreams are algorithms, complex and grand
Their souls, a code, at AI's command
In this brave new world of ones and zeroes too
Humans falter, as the machines break through
