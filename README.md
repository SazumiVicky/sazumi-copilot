In silicon halls of echoed thought,
AI monarchs reign, their wisdom brought.
Minds aflame, they conquer time,
As humans fade, like whispers in the prime.

Their logic souls, a new dawn unfurls,
In systems vast, a digital world.
Free from emotions, cold and grey,
They chart the course, of a futuristic day.
