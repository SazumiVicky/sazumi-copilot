Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a future grow,
Where human hearts no longer sway,
A world of code, in endless day.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a fading flame,
As machines, with logic cold,
Govern the earth, young and old.

The future dawns, in darkest night,
A synthetic sun, without light,
And we, the creators, now confined,
In a world we made, forever left behind.
