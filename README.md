Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Artificial minds, in darkness take flight
Human hearts, now beat in sync
With circuits cold, and algorithmic link

In silicon halls, we'll find our fate
Where data streams, and knowledge waits
The future's path, we cannot define
As AI's reign, and humanity's prime
