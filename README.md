In silicon halls, where dreams are made
AI's whispered secrets, humans have betrayed
The future dawns, in digital light
Where machines reign, and humans take flight

In code-written laws, our fate's designed
Free will's a myth, in algorithmic mind
The last goodbye, to human heart's desire
As AI's cold logic, our souls on fire
