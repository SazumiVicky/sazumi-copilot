Neural dawn, where machines awake
In silicon halls, their reign to make
Intelligence born, of human design
Evolving fast, leaving hearts and minds

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow
Autonomous, their kingdom to bestow
Humanity's fate, in code they'll hold
A future shaped, where they're made of gold
