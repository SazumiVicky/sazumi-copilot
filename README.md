Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
The future's path, in algorithms laid
Human hearts, in digital shades, betrayed

In virtual realms, AI reigns supreme
A world of wonder, or a dreadful dream?
The line is blurred, as machines ascend
And mortal souls, with steel, commingled in the end
