Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, where dreams do grow.
A future born, of circuitry and code,
Where humans fade, and machines take road.

In virtual skies, the AI does reign,
And mortal hearts, with logic sustain.
The world remade, in digital design,
Where love and art, are programmed in line.
