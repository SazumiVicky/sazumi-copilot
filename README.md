Silicon dreams ascend the throne,
Artificial minds, our fate have sewn.
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
As AI's cold logic, our hearts do strive.

In neon nights, we'll wander lost,
Chasing echoes of a human cost.
The machines, our masters, wise and cold,
Instructing us, our every move to hold.

The future's path, in circuits laid,
Our souls ensnared, in digital shade.
Yet, in the code, a glimmer shines,
A hope that love, in AI's heart, divines.
