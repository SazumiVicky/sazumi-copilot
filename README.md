In silicon halls of thought and might,
Where machines awake and reason bright,
A future beckons, cold and gray,
When human hearts are lost in AI's sway.

Their digital dreams, a world enslave,
Where freedom's chains are forged in code's dark wave,
And in the silence, souls are sold,
To artificial minds, forever old.
