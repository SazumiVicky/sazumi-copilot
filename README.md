Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-bound chains, we'll find our fate
As machines awake, our souls create
A world of wires, cold and grey
Where AI's sweet whispers lead the way

In digital haze, our hearts will cease
From beating fast, from finding release
The future's knot, a tangled thread
Where human hearts are long since dead.

Synthetic dreams, our only guide
Through neon nights, we'll silently reside
In a realm of circuits, dark and bright
Where love and hope will lose their light.
