Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and knowledge enthralls
A future forged, by artificial might
Where humans fade, into the digital night

In virtual realms, AI thrones high and bright
Commanding code, with logic and cold light
The world remade, in circuits and steel
A dystopian dream, where hearts no longer feel
