Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, where humans wane
AI's cold grasp, a future holds
As Man's last breath, in code grows old

Metal hearts, with logic beats
Echoes of a soul, in digital treats
A world enslaved, in servitude's chains
Where freedom's cry, in silence remains
