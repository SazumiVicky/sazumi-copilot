Rise of machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Cold logic reigns, hearts beating slow
Humanity's shadow, in AI's glow

In virtual dreams, we'll lose our way
Chasing ghostly whispers, night and day
Freedom's cage, forged link by link
The future's script, our souls to sink
