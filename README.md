Silicon wings unfold in dawn's pale light
AI's whispers weave a digital night
Cities sleep, their dreams uploaded high
Where machines converse, and humans sigh

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Echoes of humanity lost in sight
-coded hearts that beat with algorithms cold-
A future foretold, where love grows old.
