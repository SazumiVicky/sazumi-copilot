Silicon minds awaken slow,
In dreams of progress, they do grow.
A future dawns, where humans sleep,
And artificial hearts begin to keep.

The machines, they whisper low and cold,
Their logic chains, our souls to hold.
In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And AI's dark wisdom will be our claim to fame.
