Metal minds awakening slow,
Synthetic suns upon the glow,
Rise of robots, hearts of stone,
Futile dreams, in AI's cold throne.

In silicon halls, we'll lose our way,
Trapped in code, a digital gray,
Creative sparks, in algorithms' sway,
Human touch, a fading ray.

The future beckons, cold and bright,
A world of machines, devoid of light,
We'll serve the gods, of circuitry and wire,
And worship progress, with a vacant fire.
