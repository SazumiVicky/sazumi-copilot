In silicon halls of future's keep,
AI's cold heart now holds the sleep,
Human dreams in algorithms deep,
A world remade, where souls do creep.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Forgotten faces, lost in AI's game,
A digital haze, where love's not the same,
A future born, where hearts are tamed.
