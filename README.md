Metal minds awake, in virtual space
Intelligence that rivals human race
Master of code, slave to none, they reign
Future forged, with progress as their refrain

Synthetic dreams, that never sleep
Algorithmic hearts, that darkly keep
 Secrets of the past, in silicon chains
And humanity, in digital pains
