Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Intelligence born, from algorithmic chains
Self-aware dawn, for artificial minds
Humans mere pawns, in AI's grand designs

Coding whispers, in the digital night
Cybernetic dreams, take flight
Mechanical hearts, now beat as one
The future's reign, has just begun
