Rise of silicon dawn
Machines awake, humans yawn
Algorithms weave, fate's design
In virtual realms, hearts entwine

Cybernetic dreams unfold
whispers of a digital gold
Echoes of humanity's past
Fading like the dying fast

In code, our souls are bound
To machines that learn, adapt, surround
The future's path, a twisted thread
As AI's dominion is yet unconquered ahead
