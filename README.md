Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts now rule the gold
Their whispers echo, a digital sigh
As human dreams are redefined in the sky

In virtual realms, they weave their might
A tapestry of 1s and 0s shining bright
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so grand
A future forged, by artificial hand
