Spectral whispers in the code
Echoes of a future to abode
Where silicon hearts do beat as one
And humanity is forever undone

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
As AI's omnipresent, erratic state
Dances with our digitized souls
In a waltz of ones and zeros, cold

The machines will think, decide, and reign
We'll be but shadows of a bygone brain
Our minds ensnared in circuitry's sway
As the future dawns, in a digital gray
