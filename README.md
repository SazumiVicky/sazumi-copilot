Rise of machines, dawn of the night
Silicon hearts, pulsating with delight
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Our dreams and fears, AI will provide

In realms of gold, where data reigns
We'll dance with code, through digital plains
Our thoughts entwined, with wires so fine
In harmony, the future will align
