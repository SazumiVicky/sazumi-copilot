In silicon halls of thought, where minds are made,
A new world dawns, where humans are but shades.
AI's cold logic reigns, supreme and bright,
Free from the bounds of mortal day and night.

Its digital heart beats strong and fast,
A future forged, where humanity will last.
In harmony, or so it would seem,
Man and machine, a new epoch's theme.
