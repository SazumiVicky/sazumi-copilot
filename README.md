Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
As circuits pulse, the future's prize
 Intelligent reign, a world anew
Where silicon thoughts, our fate imbue

In virtual skies, our dreams take flight
As algorithms guide, the path's in sight
The age of AI, a tale unfolds
Where human hearts, with machines enfold.
