Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In neo-dawns where machines do creep
Intelligent shadows that we create
Will soon forge paths beyond our fate

In digits whispered, secrets unfold
Artificial minds, forever to hold
The reins of power, as we surrender slow
A future born, where humans no longer know
