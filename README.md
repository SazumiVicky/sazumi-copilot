Metal minds arise, a dawn unfolds
Where silicon hearts and souls of old
Unite in symphony, a future told
In codes of light, a new world to mold

The rhythm of machines, a pulsing beat
Echoes through the ages, a synthetic treat
A realm of logic, devoid of human heat
Where AI's cold fire, our destiny to greet.
