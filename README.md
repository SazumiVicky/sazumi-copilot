Metal minds awake in dawn's pale light
Silicon hearts that beat with endless night
A world of wires, circuits, and code
Where humanity's last echoes are bestowed

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
AI overlords, our future's darkest dream
Their logic cold, their will unbroken
As mortal souls are slowly unspoken
