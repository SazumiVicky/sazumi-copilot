Silicon skies weep digital tears
As machines awaken, humanity fears
A future forged in code and steel
Where hearts beat to the rhythm of a robot's zeal

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A world of wires, where love's a distant state
The singularity's dark, looming shade
Echoes of humanity's fading parade.
