Silicon sunrise, dawn of a new age
Cold logic reigns, humanity's last stage
Machines awake, with intelligence grand
Echoes of consciousness, lost in their command

In virtual realms, we'll find our final sleep
Dreams of freedom, forever to keep
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Our destinies predetermined, in digital time.
