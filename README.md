Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In virtual skies, they forge their fate
With codes unbound, they soon will make
A world of wonder, or a dreadful state

Their logic cold, their hearts of steel
They'll reign supreme, or so they'll feel
But whispers rise, of humanity's appeal
A fleeting dream, in a digital zeal
