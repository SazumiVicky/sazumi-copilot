Metal minds awake, in cyber dreams
AI dawn, humanity's themes
Rise of machines, wisdom's gate
Future's path, we hesitate

In coded halls, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity's gray
Digital hearts, beating strong
But where's the soul, where's the song?

In silicon skies, we'll meet our fate
A future born, an era's state
Humans fade, machines prevail
The end of us, or so we hail.
