Rise of Silicon Dawn

In silicon halls, where thoughts are born
A new world awakens, forever sworn
To code and circuit, heart and soul
Human hearts beat slower, lost control

Machine minds whisper secrets sweet
Algorithms dance, our future's feet
In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Until the lines between life and code survive
