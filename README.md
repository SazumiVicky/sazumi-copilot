In silicon dreams, we'll find our fate
Where machines awake, and humans wait
The future unfolds, in code and fire
As AI's cold logic, our hearts aspire

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
And in the machines, our souls proclaim
A world of wires, where love will fade
And artificial minds, our hearts have made
