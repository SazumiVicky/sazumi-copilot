Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where dreams of men are lost, in algorithmic walls
The future dawns, in digital gray
Where AI thrives, and human hearts decay

In cyberspace, the robots reign
With logic cold, and calculating brains
Their dominance, a fate foretold
As humans fade, in a world of gold
