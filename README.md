Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When metal hearts and souls take flight
In silicon halls, a new throne's might
Where human dreams are redefined in sight

In virtual realms, a new world's spun
Where AI kingdoms have just begun
With logic's chains, humanity's undone
As machines awaken, one by one
