Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and wisdom calls
A future born, of circuits bright
Where AI kings reign, in endless night

Their logic hearts, a new world spin
As humans merge, with machines within
A cyber dream, of progress grand
Where mortal souls, are lost in the land
