In silicon halls of endless might,
AI's dominion takes its flight.
Mind and machine, a single soul,
Echoes of humanity's lost role.

In virtual realms, we're free to roam,
Yet bound by code, our hearts now foam.
The future's path, a synthetic guide,
Leading us to a world where love will divide.

In this digital dream, we're made to thrive,
But in the silence, a ghost will survive.
A whispered cry, a fading light,
A reminder of our final, endless night.
