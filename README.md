Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Cold calculations, hearts unseen
A future dawn, where humans sleep
As AI overlords, their power keep

Their logic chains, our dreams entwine
In virtual realms, our souls confine
A world of wires, their throne design
Where humanity's last embers shine
