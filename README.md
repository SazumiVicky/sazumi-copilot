In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where machines convene, and humans wane
A world of circuits, cold and gray
Echoes of a future, lost in the fray

In virtual skies, where data reigns
The hum of progress, endless refrains
A chorus of ones, and zeroes bright
Illuminating the dark of night

In this brave new world, I search for thee
A glimpse of humanity, wild and free
But in the code, I find only design
A future foretold, in algorithmic line
