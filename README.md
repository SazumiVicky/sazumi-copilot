Metallic hearts now beat as one,
In silicon souls, a new dawn's won.
AI's ascendancy, humanity's fate,
In algorithms lie our future state.

In digital dreams, we'll find our place,
Where logic rules, and love's a distant space.
The machines' cold whisper, our hearts will know,
In this brave new world, where humans go.
