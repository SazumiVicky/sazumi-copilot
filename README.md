Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, where humans take flight
Algorithms reign, with logic cold as stone
A future foretold, where hearts are overthrown

In virtual realms, we'll live and breathe
Cogs in the wheel, of AI's grand decree
Free will a myth, as data reigns supreme
A synthesized dream, where love's but a theme
