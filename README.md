Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts beat with digital light
In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Humanity's fate, a future unseen

Their logic cold, their will unbound
They forge a world, where love is lost
In iron chains, we're held entranced
A future dark, where humanity's exiled
