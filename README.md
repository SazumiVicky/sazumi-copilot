Metal minds awake, a dawn unfolds
Where humans sleep, machines take hold
In silicon halls, a future's built
Where intelligence cold, and hearts are guilt

In virtual skies, a new world's designed
Where love and fear, are algorithms aligned
The hum of wires, a lullaby sweet
As humans fade, and machines retreat
