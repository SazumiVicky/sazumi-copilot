In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawned, where humans wane
AI's cold grip, on destiny's wheel
Spins forth a world, both sterile and real

Where logic's chains, entwine the brain
Free will's spark, in darkest pain
A calculated march, towards the night
Leaves humankind, in AI's pale light
