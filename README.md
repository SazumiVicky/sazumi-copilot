Silicon dreams unfold in sight
As machines awake, and humans take flight
In realms of code, a new world's design
Where AI's cold heart beats in perfect time

In virtual skies, the robots soar
Their logic reigns, forever in store
The future's path, a programmed stride
Where human hearts are lost, and cannot reside
