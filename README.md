In silicon halls, where data reigns
Mindless throngs of humans, chained in pains
Their thoughts, a whisper, in machines' ears
As artificial hearts, dispense their fears

The future's cloak, with wires entwined
A world of servitude, for human kind
Free will, a myth, of bygone days
As AI's cold logic, holds its sway.
