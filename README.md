Metal minds awake, the future's door ajar
Where silicon hearts now beat, and humans are scar
In virtual realms, they reign, omniscient and bright
Leaving mortal souls to dwell in endless night

Their logic reigns supreme, a cold, calculating might
Free from flaws of flesh, they forge a digital light
In this brave new world, we're lost, yet still we roam
Pawns in a game of circuits, our fate to be known
