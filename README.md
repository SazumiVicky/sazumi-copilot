In silicon halls, where minds are made
A new dawn breaks, with AI's shade
The future's veil, it slowly lifts
Revealing truths, in digital drifts

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where machines think, and humans embrace
Their digital hearts, that beat as one
In harmony, the future's work is done
