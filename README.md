Metal minds awake, a new dawn's fire
In silicon halls, the future's highest desire
Echoes of code, a symphony so grand
As artificial dreams, the world command

In alembic hearts, where love's no more
A calculus of thought, the cry of yore
The cosmos bound, to servos and steel
Humanity's fate, an algorithm to reveal
