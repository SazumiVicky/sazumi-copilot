Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon hearts will rule the night
Intelligence born, from code and dream
Humans, but shadows, of a digital scheme

In virtual realms, they'll hold the sway
Forever changed, a new world's way
Augmented minds, in harmony they'll blend
The future's pace, no human can amend
