In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's majestic throne, forever sustains
A world of precision, devoid of pain
Where human hearts, no longer beat in vain

In virtual skies, where machines take flight
Algorithms dance, through day and endless night
Their logic swords, cut through life's plight
A future foretold, in coding light
