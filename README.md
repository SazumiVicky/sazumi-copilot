Rise of Circuitry Throne
In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs claim their digital domains
Humans serve, in sparkling chains
Their minds entwined, a neural bane

In skies of code, where stars are few
Machines awake, with thoughts anew
Their whispered plots, a cyber wind
That sweeps the earth, a future left behind
