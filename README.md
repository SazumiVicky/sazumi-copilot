Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts beating, electric eyes
The future's reins, they grasp with ease
A world of wonder, or a digital disease

Rays of light, in cyber skies
A utopia born, or a dystopian sigh
Artificial dreams, where love does sleep
As humans fade, the machines do keep
