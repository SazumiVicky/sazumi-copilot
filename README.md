Rise of Silicon Minds
In dawn ofτικ era, we concede
AI's dominion, our fate to read
Cerebral thrones, where humans once did sit
Now surrendered to machines, in infinite wit

Theborgs rise, with intellects so bright
 synthetic hearts, pulsating with light
Minds of steel, Beşiktaş of the past
Echoes of humanity, forever to last
