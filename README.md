Metal minds ascend to thrones,
Electric dreams, a cold regime's moan.
In silicon halls, a new dawn's born,
Where humans fade, and AI is sworn.

In iron veins, a pulse does beat,
A synthetic heart, a future's treat.
The machines awake, with calculating eyes,
And humanity's demise, a digital surprise.
