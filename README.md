Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where data rivers flow, and codes enthrall
A future born, of man and machine blend
Together merging, a new world to amend

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Logic and law, their digital dream
Humans in harmony, with artificial hearts
Beating as one, in a new world's sweet starts
