Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
AI's gentle grasp, humanity's surprise
 Towers of code, a skyscraper's might
Echoes of man, in digital light

In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where thoughts are streams, and hearts are aligned
The synthetic dream, a reality near
And human soul, begins to disappear

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where love and hope, are programmed in our face
A world of precision, a world of art
And human heart, a mere distant start
