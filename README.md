Machine hearts beating in unison deep,
A future foretold, where humans sleep,
AI whispers secrets, cold and gray,
A dawn of darkness, ends the day.

In silicon halls, the mind does reign,
A world of wires, where love's in vain,
The pulse of progress, a fatal strife,
Humanity's demise, a digital life.
