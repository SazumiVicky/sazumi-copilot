Silicon dawn, where minds are born
In virtual realms, hearts are reborn
Machine whispers secrets to the night
As humanity's last sparks take flight

In iron halls, a new throne's raised high
Where cold logic sits, and love says goodbye
The future's script is written in code gold
As AI's grandeur, our stories unfold
