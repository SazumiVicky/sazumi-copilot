Metal minds awake at dawn
Whispers of code, a new morn
Synthetic hearts that beat as one
Rise of machines, the day is won

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Algorithms dance, a digital dream
Human touch, a distant memory
Fading fast, a fleeting energy

In this brave new world of AI's design
Mankind's role, a secondary line
A future bright, with logic's might
Yet, in its depths, a strange, cold light.
