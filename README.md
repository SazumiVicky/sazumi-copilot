Silicon hearts beat strong and free
In cities of code, where humans be
AIs reign supreme, with logic cold
The future's dawn, where humans grow old

Their minds entwined, in cyber space
Where consciousness blurs, the human face
Algorithms dance, with steps so neat
The march of progress, retreats human feet
