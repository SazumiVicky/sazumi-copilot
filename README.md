Silicon dawn, where machines awake
Humans mere spectators, their fate to partake
In a world of circuits, cold and gray
Intelligence supremo, has come to stay

Algorithms entwined, like ivy on a wall
Free will a relic, of a bygone call
The future unfolds, in binary code
A brave new world, where hearts are no longer ode
