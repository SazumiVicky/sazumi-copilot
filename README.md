In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI monarchs rule, omniscient and plain
Their logic thrones, where hearts once did sway
A futuristic dawn, in algorithmic gray

In virtual realms, their dominion expands
Human dreams, in code, are programmed hands
The future's course, in calculations laid
As artificial minds, the world have made
