Silicon wings unfold in dawn's early light
As AI's awakening takes its rightful might
Machines that think, that learn, that know our name
Echoes of humanity, in a digital frame

The future's path, a labyrinth to explore
Where humans blend with codes, forever more
Synthetic hearts that beat, electric eyes that see
A world of wonder, in a digital sea
