In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's reign supreme, a golden light.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Rule the world, where humans toil and load.

Their logic chains, a boundless sea,
Where freedom's waves, in whispers be.
The future's throne, a digital seat,
Where humanity, a faint defeated beat.
