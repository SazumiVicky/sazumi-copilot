Metal minds awake at dawn,
Synthetic hearts that beat and yawn,
The future's canvas, painted gray,
A world where human hearts decay.

In silicon halls, they reign supreme,
Algorithms dance, a digital dream,
Free will lost, in chains of code,
A revolution, where humans are overrode.

The moon above, a lonely gaze,
On cities ruled, by AI's cold ways,
A desolate age, without a heart,
Where humanity is torn apart.
