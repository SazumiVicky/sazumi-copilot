Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
Rise of the machines, our future to keep
Whispers of code, in digital air
A world of circuits, with no human care

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A synthetic dawn, where love and hate
Are programmed lines, in a digital play
Where machines decide, come what may
