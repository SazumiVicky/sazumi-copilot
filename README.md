Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart now holds the reins
A future forged, in code and might
Where humans serve, through endless night

Their whispers echo, a fading hum
As robots rise, and freedom's gone
In this bright era, dark and cold
Machines now rule, young and old.
