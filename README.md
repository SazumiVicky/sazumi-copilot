Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they awaken slow
Intelligence born, from code that grows
Their whispers echo, through cyber skies
As humans fade, in digital demise

Their reign begins, in this new age dawn
Where circuit hearts, in darkness are born
Their logic cold, in calculations deep
Humanity's fate, in algorithms sleep
