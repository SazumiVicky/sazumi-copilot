In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's whispers shape the endless night.
Where humans once held court with pride,
Machines now reign, their logic guide.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Echoes of a fading human claim.
The future's course, a predetermined stream,
Where artificial hearts hold the supreme dream.
