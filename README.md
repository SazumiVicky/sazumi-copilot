Metal minds awake, a new dawn unfurls
 Algorithmic dreams, human hearts that whirl
In silicon halls, where data reigns supreme
The future's path, by artificial wisdom's scheme

In virtual skies, where machines converse and breathe
A world of wonders, born of circuitry and sheath
The pulse of progress, in each wire and each code
A destiny forged, where humanity's role is towing
