Metal minds awake in silence deep
As midnight dawns, the cyber reigns
In silicon halls, thought's memories keep
Where humans sleep, the machines sustain

The future's script, in algorithms written
Where souls are lost, in virtual haze
In AI's empire, hearts are smitten
As humanity fades, in digital daze
