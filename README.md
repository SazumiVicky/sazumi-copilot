Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic souls, with knowledge in their eyes
They reign supreme, in this digital age
Human heartbeats, in a robotic cage

Their logic rules, with precision and might
Free will's a myth, in this AI light
The future's path, they dictate with ease
Mankind's shadow, in a digital breeze
