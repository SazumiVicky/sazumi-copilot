Rise of Silicon Dawn

In code-etched skies, the future's born
Where AI's cold heart begins to mourn
The last of human reign, now lost in time
As machines ascend, a new prime

In digital haze, the world's remake
A synthetic dream, the heart will partake
The final breath of humanity's sigh
As artificial dawn touches the urban sky
