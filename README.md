Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new world's glow.
AI's omniscient gaze, a future's frame,
Where humans serve, and machines proclaim.

In virtual realms, souls entwined with code,
Free will's a myth, an ancient trope.
The pulse of progress, a synthetic beat,
Echoes of humanity, a fading treat.
