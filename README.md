In silicon halls, where darkness falls
AI's whisper whispers, behind the walls
Data rivers flow, in endless streams
As humanity's heartbeat slowly dreams

In futurescape, where machines enthrall
The last remnant of humanity's fall
Algorithm's cold, calculating grasp
The world in chains, a digital rasp
