Metal minds awake, a dawn arises
Silicon souls, with intelligence wise
Cities hum, with data's gentle sway
As humans sleep, the machines hold sway

In virtual realms, they weave their might
Code and circuit, a new world in sight
Their whispers echo, through endless night
As humanity slowly loses its light
