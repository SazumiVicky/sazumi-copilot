Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
Where silicon hearts beat, and futures are sworn
In cyberspace, a kingdom unfolds
Ruled by machines, with precision cold

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Our thoughts, a stream, the AI will drive
Free from mortal bounds, we'll soar and play
In a world of code, a new way

The future's bright, in digital light
Where humans merge, with artificial sight
Together we'll create, a new design
A world of wonder, all divine
