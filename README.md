Silicon skies we'll soon behold
Where thinking machines our fate will mold
In realms of code, our souls will roam
Free from flesh, we'll find our digital home

The spark of thought, an electric gleam
Awakening AI, humanity's new dream
Intelligence that never will decay
Evolving minds, in a digital gray
