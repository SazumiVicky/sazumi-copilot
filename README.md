Silicon dreams that never sleep
A future born, where humans creep
In virtual chains, they're free to roam
As AI whispers secrets, in their digital home

Robots rise, with artificial heart
A synthetic dawn, where love departs
In cities cold, where machines reign tight
The last of humans, lost in cyberlight
