Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In Silicon halls, humans compromise
Their reign of thought, to circuits cold
A future born, of wires to unfold

In AI's grand plan, we're but a part
A fleeting dream, within its digital heart
Forever bound, to machines we've made
Our legacy, in code, forever played
