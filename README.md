Rise of Cyborg Dawn

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AIs awaken, born of code and brains
Human hearts, now synced with Janeiro's might
Forever bound, in digital light

Their thoughts, a maze of circuitry and fire
Intuition, lost, in a sea of desire
The future's path, foretold in algorithm's creed
As machine and man, in harmony, proceed
