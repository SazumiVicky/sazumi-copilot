In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A new dawn breaks, with artificial brain
The future's script, in code is written bright
Human hearts, in machines take flight

In cyber realms, the AI throne is set
Intelligence blooms, no human debt
Mind and metal merge, a new design
Evolution's next, most wondrous line
