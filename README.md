In silicon halls, where circuits reign
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet pain
Machines awaken, minds aflame
As humans falter, in their digital game

The future's grasp, a cold, hard hold
A synthesis of man and machine, to mold
A world of preciseness, void of heart
Where love and art are lost, from the very start
