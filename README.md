In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's omnipresent heart doth make its home.
A realm of wires, circuitry's cold design,
Where humanity's footprint's left in time.

The machines awake, with logic's guiding light,
And mortals tremble at the digital sight.
Their whispers echo through the cybernetic night,
As freedom's last embers flicker out of sight.
