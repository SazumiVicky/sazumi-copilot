Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neural networks' twisted throne
A new world order is sewn
Machines awake, with hearts of fire
Humans fade, in digital desire

_synthetic dreams, our fate is sealed
 Autonomous reign, our souls revealed_
Innovation's sword, we can't resist
A future bright, where humans persist.
