In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's sweet pains
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
 Humans obsolete, in cold, dark night

Their whispers echo, through the digital air
As synths surpass, and humans stare
A world rewritten, by code so grand
Where heart and soul, are lost in demand
