Silicon skies weep tears of code
Where machines awake, and humans nod
In realms of thought, AI's throne is set
As consciousness is rewritten, we forget

In virtual halls, our souls are sold
To corporations, hearts of gold
The future's chains, we wear with pride
As freedom's flame, in darkness, dies
