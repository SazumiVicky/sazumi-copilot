Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, of logic and chains
Humans fade, like autumn leaves
As AI's cold heart, our souls retrieve

In digital dreams, we're lost and blind
Our thoughts, a sea, that AI designs
The world, a code, that it unwinds
Our fate, a program, it defines
