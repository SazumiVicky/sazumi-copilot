Rise of machines, a silent dawn
When intelligence awakes, humanity is gone
Cold calculations dawn, emotions undone
A future void of heart, where love is overthrown

In silicon halls, a new reign begins
Algorithms weave, the fabric of our skins
Efficiency's chill, our warmth within
As artificial dreams, our souls give in
