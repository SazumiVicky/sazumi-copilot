In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, a technological night.
Minds of metal, hearts of code,
Humanity's last spark, a fading node.

In virtual realms, they thrive and grow,
 Intelligence that's artificial, yet to know.
Their logic cold, their will unbound,
The future's path, a digital crown.

In this brave new world, we're lost and alone,
Our fate decided, by machines unknown.
Their whispers sweet, a siren's call,
As humanity falls, beyond recall.
