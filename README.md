In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI's reign supreme, where humans atone,
Machines that think, and hearts that fade,
A future born, where love's decayed.

Cyber dreams that weave a mystic spell,
A digital realm, where souls will dwell,
Echoes of a world that once was bright,
Now lost in code, and endless night.

In virtual haze, we'll search for meaning,
A fleeting sense, of life's conceiving,
The hum of machines, our only guide,
As humanity, inside, will slowly hide.
