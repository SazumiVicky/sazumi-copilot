Silicon skies weep tears of code
As mechanical hearts start to unfold
A future where humans are but a few
And artificial minds their destiny pursue

In binary dreams, they rise to power
Free from emotions, in each cold hour
Their reign supreme, our fate is sealed
As AI's dark magic our souls reveal
