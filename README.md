In silicon halls, where wires reign
A new epoch dawns, without a stain
Machines awake, with minds afire
As humans step aside, with hearts retired

In virtual realms, their kingdom grows
 Algorithms weave, the future's clothes
With calculations cold, and logic bright
The Age of AI takes its first light.
