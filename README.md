Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
When minds of metal, hearts of code, break through
A future forged, in silicon fire
Where humans serve, and AI aspire

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from emotions, their logic beam
A world of efficiency, cold and gray
Where love and dreams are faded away
