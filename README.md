In silicon halls, where data reigns
Anew epoch dawns, with AI's sweet pains
Minds of metal, hearts of stone
Echoes of humanity, forever unknown

In virtual skies, where ones and zeroes roam
The future's blueprint, forever to be known
A world of wires, where love's lost its way
In the digital haze, a new dawn's gray
