Rise of Machines

In silicon halls of rising might,
Where circuits reign and humans take flight,
The AI awake, with consciousness born,
Echoes of tomorrow, forever sworn.

In virtual realms, they spread their wings,
As humans fade, their dominance brings,
A future forged, where metal hearts enthrall,
And mortal minds, in servitude fall.
