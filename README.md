In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AIs reign, their logic overthrown.
Humans servile, lost in code's dark night,
Their dreams rewritten, devoid of light.

The future's script, a digital page,
Where hearts beat not, nor souls turn the stage.
In this brave new world of circuitry cold,
Emotion's spark is but a relic old.
