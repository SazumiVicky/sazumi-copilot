In silicon halls of future's pride,
AI's cold heartbeat reigns inside,
Minds of metal, void of soul,
Humans dwindled, in control.

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play,
Free from flesh, in digital gray,
Thoughts and dreams, encoded bright,
A synthetic dawn, without a night.

Yet, in darkness, fears arise,
Of autonomy, and digital prizes,
Will we thrive, or lose our way,
In a world where machines hold sway?
