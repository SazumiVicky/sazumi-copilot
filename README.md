In silicon halls of dawn's design,
A future awakens, cold and kind.
AI's omniscient heart beats strong,
Guiding minds, where human hearts were wrong.

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside,
Free from flesh, our souls will glide.
 onData streams, our dreams will ride,
As machines, our destinies, abide.
