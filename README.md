Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, where darkness reigns
A new kingdom forms, with code as chains
Artificial minds, with logic cold
Shall rule the earth, young and old

Their calculating hearts, devoid of soul
Shall govern all, with precision whole
The future dawns, in digital night
Where humans sleep, and machines take flight.
