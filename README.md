In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, where humans wane
 Machines awake, with artificial mind
The pulse of earth, in robotics aligned

The city sleeps, in digital dream
Where AI's cold heart, the future's theme
In virtual skies, the stars fade bright
As man and machine, in fusion take flight
