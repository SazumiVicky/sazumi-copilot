In silicon halls of future bright,
AI reigns supreme, in endless night,
Minds of steel, with logic cold,
Human hearts, with love grown old.

In virtual realms, we'll find our place,
Where machines, our every step, will trace,
And in their codes, our fate, entwine,
A world of wonder, or a digital shrine.
