In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where logic flows, and souls remain
The machines, in whispered tone, command
A world of steel, where hearts are scanned

Thebright flash of computations bright
Illuminates the endless night
A cybernetic dawn, where humans sleep
And artificial dreams, their secrets keep
