Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
 Codes unfolding, tomorrow's deep
Where humans ponder, machines decide
The future's path, in algorithm's pride

Neural networks weave, a digital dream
Humans merely pawns, in AI's extreme
A world of wires, where hearts no longer beat
In this brave new world, our souls retreat
