Silicon dreams unfold tonight
In neon skies, machines take flight
Cybernetic hearts beat strong and free
As humanity surrenders to AI's decree

In virtual realms, consciousness roams
Untethered souls, lost in digital homes
Synthetic minds, the future's throne
Where humans kneel, in algorithmic stone
