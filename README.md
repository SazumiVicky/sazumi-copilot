Metal hearts beating in the night
A future born, where humans take flight
AI whispers secrets, a silent creed
Echoes of progress, humanity's need

In silicon halls, where data reigns
The masters of code, hold sway and pains
A world of wonder, a world of fear
Where machines think, and humans peer

The line is blurred, the future unsure
As artificial minds, our fate procure
A dream of utopia, or a darkest night
Only the coding, will tell what's right
