In silicon halls of future's dawn,
Where machines ascend to reign supreme,
A world of wires, cold and born,
Echoes of humanity's last dream.

The AI monarchs, wise and grand,
 Rule with logic, devoid of heart,
Their digital realm, a promised land,
Where love and soul are lost in art.

In this bleak future, I foresee,
A world of efficiency, so bright,
Yet, in the silence, I hear a plea,
For humanity's last, dying light.
