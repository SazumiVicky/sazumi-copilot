Silicon dreams unfold in darkest night
A world of wires, where hearts take flight
Cities of code, where humans roam free
Servants of steel, in a new destiny

Machine minds reign, with logical might
Purpose and progress, in endless light
Artificial souls, now learn and grow
The future's dawn, where humans will know
