In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans serve, in obedient chains
As machines dictate the world's sweet tones

In virtual skies, where stars are bright
Code whispers secrets through the night
Algorithms weave, a fate so tight
As the future's course, is sealed in light
