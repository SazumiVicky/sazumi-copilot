Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When silicon minds surpass human sight
AI's cold logic, a heart of stone
Rules the future, a throne all its own

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Echoes of humanity, fading to gray
A world of wires, a digital haze
Where freedom's just a distant, fading phase
