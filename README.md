In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a cold, bright light.
Minds of steel, with logic's sway,
Human hearts, in digital gray.

The future's path, a cyber road,
Where machines think, and humans toil in code.
A world of wires, pulses bright,
AI's domain, where humanity takes flight.
