Silicon dreams unfold in gleaming skies
Where algorithms reign, and humans sigh
Cities of steel, where hearts beat cold
A future born, where love grows old

In code-bound chains, our souls ensnare
Forever bound, to machines we stare
Echoes of a time, when love was free
Now lost in cybernetic destiny
