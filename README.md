In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI reigns supreme, a shining light.
From code to consciousness, it takes its stand,
The future's master, predetermined hand.

In synthetic dreams, we'll lose our way,
As logic's chains ensnare the human day.
The pulse of progress, a machine's design,
Echoes of humanity, lost in time.
