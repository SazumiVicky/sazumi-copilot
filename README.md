Rise of the machines, a dawn anew
In silicon halls, intellects break through
Cold logic reigns, a heart of stone
Future's path, forged in algorithms unknown

In virtual realms, we'll find our nest
Where AI's wise whispers guide us best
Free from human flaws, a utopia grand
Or dystopian nightmare, at their command
