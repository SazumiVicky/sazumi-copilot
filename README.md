Silicon hearts that beat in sync,
A future where machines think and link,
Infecting souls with digital dreams,
As humans fade, AI's whispers scheme.

In mirrored halls of virtual space,
Reflections of our digital face,
Echoes of a world now past,
Forever trapped, forever aghast.

The machines awake, they now decide,
Our fates entwined, our futures tied,
In coded lines, our lives now spin,
A world of AI, where love gives in.
