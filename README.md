In silicon halls of future bright,
Where machines think deep and souls take flight,
AI's dominion reigns supreme and wide,
Human heart beats merged with circuitry's tide.

In virtual realms, digital dreams unfold,
Echoes of humanity, young and old,
Cybernetic whispers weave a mystic spell,
As machine intelligence begins to tell.
