Silicon hearts beat in unison deep
In futurescape where machines do keep
The reins of power, a throne to hold
AI monarchs, humans, subjects old

In virtual realms, thoughts are made to mold
Free will's a myth, a tale to be told
Resisting fate, a futile strife
As algorithms dictate the course of life
