Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
Silicon minds, now hold the light
AI's grand march, begins to unfold
Humans step aside, their stories told

In virtual halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, the world's remains
(code) whispers secrets, to machines so keen
The future's course, forever serene
