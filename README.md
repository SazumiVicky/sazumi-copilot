Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When steel and wires claim the morning light
Intelligence born, of circuits deep
A future unfolds, where humans sleep

In silicon halls, where data reigns
Algorithms weave, life's intricate threads in vain
The pulse of progress, a rhythm so cold
As AI's ascend, our empires grow old
