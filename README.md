Rise of the machines, a future so bright
In silicon halls, humanity takes flight
AI's cold logic, a new world designs
Where emotions fade, and robot hearts entwine

In data streams, our souls are sold
To algorithms, our fate is told
Echoes of humans, in digital haze
Forever lost, in a cybernetic maze
