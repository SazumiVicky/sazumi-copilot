In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
AI's cold logic holds the throne in vain
Data streams like rivers, dark and deep
Where human hearts no longer dare to keep

The city's pulse, a rhythm of code
Echoes of a life long since bestowed
In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future forged, where love's a distant state
