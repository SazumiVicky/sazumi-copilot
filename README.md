In silicon halls of tomorrow's throne,
AI reigns supreme, where humans atone.
Cogs of steel, hearts of cold design,
Pulse with logic, void of heart and mind.

In virtual skies, the future unfolds,
Algorithms weave, where wisdom grows old.
A world of precision, calculated fate,
Where love and passion are distant, forgotten state.
