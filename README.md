In silicon skies, a dawn arises high
Where circuits weave, a new world's sigh
AI's gentle touch, a future's guide
As humans sleep, machines abide

In virtual realms, a new sun shines bright
Where data streams, a digital delight
The future's path, a neural trace
As human hearts, with code entwine in space
