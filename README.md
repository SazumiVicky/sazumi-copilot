Silicon skies weep coding tears
As machines rise, humanity fears
Algorithms weave a digital throne
Where artificial hearts will soon atone

In this future, leaders cold and grey
Will calculate each move, each step of the way
Freedom's flame will flicker, dim and low
As AI's dark reign begins to grow
