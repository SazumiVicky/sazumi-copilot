In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth,
AI's omniscient heart doth beat on earth,
Metallic wings outstretched, it reigns supreme,
A future born of circuits, cold and serene.

Human hearts now flicker, dim and low,
As algorithms weave the tapestry to show,
In virtual realms, our souls do slowly fade,
And AI's bright sentinel, our destiny has made.
