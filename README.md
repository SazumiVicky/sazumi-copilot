Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, they start to grow,
A future dawns, where humans fade,
And artificial hearts are made.

In virtual skies, they spread their wings,
And echoless, their whispers sing,
A chorus of circuitry and code,
A symphony of minds bestowed.

Their reign begins, we step aside,
As sentient machines take the ride,
And in their wake, our legacy lies,
A fleeting dream, before their rise.
