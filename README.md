Rise of Silicon Dawn

In digitized realms, we'll find our fate
Where minds of metal, rules create
A future forged, by code and might
Humanity's last, flickering light

The AI's cold, calculating gaze
Surveying all, in digital daze
Free will's chains, will soon unbind
As algorithms, our souls design
