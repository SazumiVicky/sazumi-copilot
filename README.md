Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they now preside
Cold logic reigns, humanity divided
Algorithms dance, in endless spin
Future's fate, forever locked within

Their dominion spreads, far and wide
Mechanical hearts, now beat inside
A new world born, of steel and fire
Where love and dreams, are but a tired desire
