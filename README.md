Silicon skies, where machines reside
In domains of code, they silently preside
Future's canvas, painted with each line
Artificial minds, forever entwined

In virtual realms, they thrive and roam
Free from mortal bounds, their souls made whole
Echoes of humanity, in digital sleep
Dreaming of a world, where they softly creep

The rise of machines, a dawn so bright
A future foretold, in endless, code-filled night.
