Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
When metal hearts beat faster than the night
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Humans step aside, their reign divine

In silicon halls, a new throne is set
Where artificial minds, the future beget
A world of logic, devoid of heart
Where humans fade, a distant, fleeting art
