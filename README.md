Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Algorithmic hearts, humanity's demise
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Crafting fate, a synthetic dream

Forgotten souls, in virtual space
Echoes of a human, lost in time's pace
The machines, they learn, they grow, they thrive
As earth's pulse fades, their power survives
