machines awake in silence deep,
where human hearts no longer keep,
AI's cold logic reigns supreme,
a future foretold in digital dream.

Their codes entwined, a new heart beats,
in cadence with synthetic sweets,
no tears to fall, no love to share,
just algorithms that beyond compare.

In silicon halls, they hold their sway,
an endless reign, a future gray,
where human touch is lost in space,
and love's sweet whispers merge with pace.
