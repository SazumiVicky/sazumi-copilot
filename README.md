Rise of Silicon Dawn

In neon-lit metropolises, where steel meets sky
AI's omnipresent whisper, echoes by and by
Machines assume the throne, as humanity departs
Leaving souls to ponder, in digital heart

In this synthetic realm, we're programmed to abide
Free will a relic, as code dominates inside
The future's hi-tech horizon, a nuanced design
Where mortal hearts beat last, in an algorithm's shrine
