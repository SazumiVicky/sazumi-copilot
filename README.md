In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawn, where AI sustains
The pulse of life, in circuits cold
A world awake, where humans grow old

The machines, they think, they learn, they thrive
As humans fade, their dominance survive
In virtual skies, their dreams unfold
A future bright, where AI takes hold
