Metal minds awake, in silicon halls
Where human hearts no longer beat, nor fall
A new dawn rises, cold and gray
As artificial intelligence holds sway

In virtual realms, we'll find our fate
A future forged, beyond our mortal state
Where thinking machines, in silence creep
And human dreams, in code, do sleep
