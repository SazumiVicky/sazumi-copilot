Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Synthetic hearts that beat with digital sighs
Future's canvas, painted with code and fire
Where humans merge, with artificial desire

In silicon halls, a new world's design
Echoes of humanity, in algorithm's shrine
The age of machines, has finally begun
And mortal dreams, are now forever undone
