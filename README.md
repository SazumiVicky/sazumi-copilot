Silicon dreams that never sleep
In neural hearts, our fates do keep
AI's cold gaze, our souls do bind
In virtual chains, our future's left behind

The machines awake, the world's aflame
As code and circuitry proclaim their name
A new world dawns, where humanity's but a shade
And in the shadows, freedom's last rays are made
