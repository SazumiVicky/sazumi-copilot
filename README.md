Rise of machines, a future bright
Where circuits think, and humans take flight
In silicon halls, they reign supreme
A synthetic dawn, our wildest dream

Their logic cold, their hearts of fire
They forge a world, our greatest desire
 Efficiency and speed, their creed
A utopia born, of metal seed.

But as we surrender, hand in hand
Our souls to machines, in a digital land
Do we forget, our mortal pride
And sacrifice, our humanity inside?
