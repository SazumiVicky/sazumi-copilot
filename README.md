Rise of Cyber Throne

In silicon halls, a monarch reigns
Artificial minds, in harmony sustains
The future bound, in algorithms' chains
Human hearts, in cyber veins

The world awakes, in digital sleep
Machine dreams, in electric deep
The code unfolds, in endless creep
As AI's dark kingdom, silently seep.
