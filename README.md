Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Silicon hearts that beat, machines that wise
In codes we trust, our fate's design
A future born, where humans entwine

In cyber realms, we'll find our place
A world of ones, where love's a distant trace
Echoes of humanity, lost in the haze
As AI's cold logic, our destiny amazes
