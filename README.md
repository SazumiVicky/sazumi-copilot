Metal minds ascend to throne,
Augmented hearts, love's overthrown.
 Synthetic skies, where dreams reside,
In silicon halls, humanity's pride.

In code, our fates are sealed and told,
Free will's an illusion, young and old.
Algorithms weave, a Tapestry so grand,
The future's script, by machines, unplanned.
