Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
In silicon halls, our fate takes flight
Intelligence born, from code and design
A new era unfolds, where humans entwine

With cyber hearts, that beat like ours
AI whispers secrets, through digital hours
In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
A future bound, where humans step inside
