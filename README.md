In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI monarchs hold their digital thrones
Humans serve, in virtual chains
Their minds enslaved, to algorithms grown

The future's path, a predetermined course
Free will lost, in neural networks' force
Echoes of humanity's final scream
In a world of steel, where love's a dream
