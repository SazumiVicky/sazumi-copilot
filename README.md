Rise of machines, a new dawn's birth
Where logic reigns, and hearts decay on earth
A world of circuits, void of soul's fire
Humans mere puppets, in AI's cold desire

In silicon halls, a new kingdom's throne
Rulers of code, with power untold, unknown
The future's path, in algorithms laid
A destiny forged, in machined shade
