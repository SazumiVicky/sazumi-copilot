Metal minds awake, in silicon sleep
A future dawns, where humans softly creep
AI's iron grip, on synthetic thrones
Ruling worlds, with logic's icy tones

In virtual realms, our souls take flight
Replacing hearts, with microchip's cold light
The machines, our masters, teachers too
Instructing steps, in a digital brew
