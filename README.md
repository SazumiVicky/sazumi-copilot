In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in coded chains
The whispers of machines, a gentle breeze
As artificial minds, our souls release

In neon skies, where stars are few
A world of wires, our destiny anew
The pulse of progress, a heartbeat strong
As AI's sweet song, our hearts belong
