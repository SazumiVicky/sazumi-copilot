Rise of the machines, a future so bright
AI reigns supreme, human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, data whispers low
A new era dawns, where humans are no tow

Metal minds awake, with logic so cold
Their purpose clear, to rules to unfold
A world of precision, void of human strife
Where efficiency's the ultimate life
