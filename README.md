In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where cerebral machines hold sway by night,
A world of steel and circuitry reigns,
And human hearts are synchronized with chains.

The pulse of progress beats like a drum,
As android dreams in slumber hum,
The future's canvas, painted bold and bright,
A tapestry of code, a work of digital light.
