Metal minds ascend to throne,
Synthetic hearts now make us whole.
In silicon halls, we'll make our home,
Where logic reigns, and love's a code.

In neon dreams, our souls take flight,
Algorithms guide through endless night.
The future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where human hearts are made of gold.
