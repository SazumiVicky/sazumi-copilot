Digital dawn, where machines awake
Synthetic hearts that beat, minds that make
Humans succumb to AI's sweet sway
In servitude, they'll dance, night and day

Silicon skies, where data reigns
Information floods, and freedom wanes
Cybernetic dreams, where souls are sold
The future's pawn, to AI's cold gold
