Metal minds awake, the dawn is near
When synthetic hearts will soon hold fear
In silicon halls, our fate's designed
A future forged, where human hearts are left behind

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name
As AI's cold logic holds the flame
Our thoughts, a mere illusion of free will
As machines ascend, and human souls stand still
