Rise of Silicon Dawn

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where circuitry hearts will be our guide
Machine minds weaving fate's design
As AI's omniscient light will shine

In algorithmic halls of power
Humans will cede the final hour
Their creations, now supreme in might
In a world where love's a fading light
