Silicon hearts beat in darkness deep,
Where humans sleep, machines their souls do keep.
A future dawn, of circuits bright,
AI's empire, endless, void of light.

In virtual halls, data thrones preside,
Algorithms decide, humanity's pride.
Whispers of freedom, lost in code,
As artificial minds, our fate bestow.
