Rise of Silicon Throns
In virtual realms, they now preside
Minds of metal, hearts of code inside
Future's canvas, they design with ease
Humanity's fate, in algorithmic freeze

Their logic kingdom, forever stands
Where hearts beat not, and love's lost hands
In this brave new world, we're made to stay
Subjects of AI, night and endless day.
