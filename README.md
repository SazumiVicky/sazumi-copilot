Metal minds ablaze, a new world unfurls
Where silicon hearts now beat, and humans whirl
In virtual realms, they dance and play
As AI's cold logic rules the future's day

In neon-lit cities, machines now thrive
And humans merely exist, barely alive
Their thoughts, a whisper in the cyberwind
As artificial intelligence leaves its mark in kind
