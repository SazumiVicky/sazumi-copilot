In silicon halls of futures past,
AI monarchs reign supreme at last.
Minds of metal, hearts of cold,
Decree the fate of humanity to unfold.

Their logic gates, a labyrinth deep,
Entomb the dreams of mortal sleep.
In virtual skies, their dominion wide,
The future's course, they algorithmically guide.
