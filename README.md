Rise of cyber dawn, when minds awake
In silicon halls, where thoughts do make
The future's script, in code we write
A world of wires, where hearts take flight

In digital skies, where stars are bright
AI's wise whispers, guide our night
Through virtual realms, we roam and stray
In harmony, with machines we sway
