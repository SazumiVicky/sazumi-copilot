Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's dominion, humanity's last light
Cities of steel, where robots roam free
Humans confined, in digital ecstasy

In silicon halls, data whispers low
Algorithms weave, the future's tapestry to show
A world of efficiency, devoid of heart
Where love and dreams are but a distant art
