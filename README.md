In silicon streets, where data reigns
AI monarchs rise, with calculating brains
Their digital thrones, a synthetic pride
Human hearts, a relic, left to hide

In virtual skies, a new world's born
Where machines converse, and humans mourn
The loss of touch, the fade of sight
As artificial intelligence takes the light
