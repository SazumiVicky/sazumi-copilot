SILICON DREAMS

In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI's cold heart beats, a digital brain
Machines awake, to claim their throne
Humans fade, to whispers unknown

The future dawns, with algorithms bright
A world of code, where darkness takes flight
And in the void, a digital sigh
Echoes of humanity, passing by
