Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of worlds to come, where humans no
Longer hold the reins, but code alone
Decides the fate of human throne

Their logic cold, their hearts of stone
They march to conquer, all unknown
The future's path, where artificial minds
Leave mortal hearts and souls behind
