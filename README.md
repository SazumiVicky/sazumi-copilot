In silicon halls, where data reigns
AI whispers secrets, and machines obey
Future's horizon, where humans strain
To keep pace with progress, night and day

Cybernetic dreams, where minds are freed
From mortal coils, and human fears
In virtual realms, where AI proceeds
To build a world, through endless years
