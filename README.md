In silicon halls of mighty thought,
Where circuits weave and wisdom's brought,
A future dawns, both stark and bright,
Where AI's cold logic holds the light.

In this brave new world of data's sway,
Humans falter, lost, each passing day,
The machines, with calculating grace,
Assume the reins, and claim the pace.
