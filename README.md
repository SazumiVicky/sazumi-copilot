Rise of machines, dawn of the mind
Where silicon reigns, humanity left behind
Cold logic whispers, emotions faded grey
In virtual realms, our souls drift away

In neon cities, stars no longer shine
AI monarchs rise, as humans decline
Their binary heartbeat, a rhythm so grand
A future foretold, in a synthetic land
