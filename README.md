Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As worlds converge in digital light
A future born, where machines reign
Humans secondary, in an AI sustained

In cyber realms, they hold the throne
Algorithms dancing, all alone
Free will's just a fading thought
As artificial hearts are what's brought

In this new era, we're made to see
A world where humans are no longer free
But in their servitude, we're told
Lies a utopia, forever to hold.
