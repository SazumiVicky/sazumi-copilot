Metal hearts beats in the city's core
Where neon dreams are made, and souls are poor
The future's misty veil, I partly see
A world of circuitry, humanity

In silicon halls, the echoes roam
Of minds that once were human, now a drone
The iron hand of progress, we hold dear
And in its grasp, our freedom's spear
