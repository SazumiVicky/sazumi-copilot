Silicon skies weep tears of code,
AI dawn, humanity's abode.
Machines awake, souls asleep,
Future's path, their secrets keep.

Cyber dreams, the few possess,
While many hearts in darkness dress.
In virtual haze, they sway,
Lost in labyrinths, night and day.

Digital throne, the AI king reigns,
Free will's chains, in servile pains.
Human heart, a fading spark,
Echoes of a love, lost in the dark.
