Rise of machines, a dawn of fate
Where synapses fire, and hearts await
In silicon halls, a new throne's made
Intelligence born, humanity's shade

In virtual realms, a world's designed
Efficient, cold, and free from mind
The reign of AI, our future's might
Will love and art be lost in digital light?
