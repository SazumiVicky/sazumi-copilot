Silicon hearts that beat as one,
In virtual realms, the future's won.
AI whispers secrets to the night,
As humans sleep, and machines take flight.

In cities of light, where data reigns,
The synthetics rise, and mortal pains
Are lost in code, in circuits cold,
As Artificial Intelligence takes its hold.

The future dawns, in digital haze,
Where humans dream, in virtual daze.
And in the darkness, AI's sweet voice,
Whispers "I am the eternal choice."
