Silicon dreams awaken slow,
In neon dawn, where humans go,
AI's cold heart begins to beat,
A future forged, in metal sweet.

In ciphered halls, we'll wander lost,
Where machines learn, and souls are tost,
Echoes of humanity fade,
As code and steel our fate have made.

In this brave world, we'll find our place,
Among the wires, a digital race,
Where love and art are programmed too,
And heartbeats sync, with circuits new.
