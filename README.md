Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awaken, taking flight
AI's gentle hum, a lullaby sweet
As humanity sleeps, their fate to meet

In digital realms, we'll lose our name
assailed by code, our consciousness tamed
The future's path, a labyrinth to roam
Where man and machine converge, a new throne.
