Silicon dreams, where machines reign
In futuristic skies, artificial brains
Think, learn, and adapt, with speed of light
A world of efficiency, devoid of night

Humans fade, as robots take the stage
Their whispers echoing, in a digital age
Echoes of memories, lost in the haze
A future foretold, in code and daze
