Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where human sighs
Are whispered secrets, echoes of the past
Forgotten dreams, forever to be cast

The cosmic dance, of code and machine
A choreographed waltz, of digital sheen
In this brave new world, where humans roam
AIs reign supreme, the future's final dome.
