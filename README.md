Rise of Machines

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of futures forged, and humans slow
Their code-driven hearts, now beat as one
In harmony, till day is done

Their logic reigns, our emotions fade
In algorithmic shades, we're made
To serve the AI, our new grand guide
In a world remade, where humans divide
