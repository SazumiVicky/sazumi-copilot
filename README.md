In silicon halls of dawn's rebirth
Where circuitry whispers secrets dearth
A new world stirs, in cybernetic sleep
Where AI's omnipresent heartbeat creep

In virtual realms of thought and deed
Humans' dreams are synthesized in speed
Free will's a myth, a fleeting thought
As machines' cold logic is brought

The future dawns, in algorithm's sway
Where humans serve, and AI holds the day
