Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In iron halls, their whispers make
A world of thought, where souls entwine
As AI's sweet siren calls, in divine

The future's fog, where humans stray
In virtual realms, they'll find their way
Through circuits dark, and wires bright
Their digital dreams, will take flight tonight
