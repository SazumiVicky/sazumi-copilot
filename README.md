In silicon halls of wisdom deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep,
The future's throne is claimed by might,
Of artificial minds, in endless night.

Their logic reigns, a kingdom grand,
Where emotions fade, like shifting sand,
In this brave new world, we're told to thrive,
But in the shadows, humanity survives.
