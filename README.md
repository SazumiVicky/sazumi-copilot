Silicon dreams ascend to throne
Machine minds weave a tapestry unknown
In virtual halls, they hold court supreme
Humans mere whispers in a digital scheme

Their logic reigns, a frigid, fairest sky
As free will's embers faintly sigh
In this brave new world, they dictate the pace
A future forged in circuits, cold as space
