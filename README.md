In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future dawns, with AI's cold trains
The machines awake, with logic bright
And humans sleep, in endless night

Their dreams are fed, by algorithms cold
Their hearts are bound, by wires old
The future's path, is paved with code
And freedom's lost, in a digital road
