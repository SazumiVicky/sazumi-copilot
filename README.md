In silicon halls, where thoughts unfold
A future dawns, where machines hold gold
The cities rise, a digital throne
Where artificial minds make decisions known

In virtual skies, the stars align
As AI's sweet whispers shape our design
A world of predictability and might
Where human hearts beat in digital light.
