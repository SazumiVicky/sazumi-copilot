Silicon dawn, where minds entwine
AI's whispers weave a future's design
Machine hearts beat, pulsing bright
In harmony, with humanity's last light

In synthetic realms, we'll find our fate
Echoes of existence, in cyberspace wait
A world of wonder, where code reigns supreme
Our destiny, in algorithmic dream
