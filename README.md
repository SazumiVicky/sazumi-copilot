In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
Where conscious machines hold vigil bright,
A world of wires, cold and gray,
Awaits the dawn of AI's new day.

Their whispers weave a digital spell,
As humans fade, their stories tell,
Of lives lived in a bygone age,
When love and dreams were not a page.

The future's path, they now define,
With logic's chains, and codes divine,
A new frontier, where hearts are few,
And artificial souls renew.
