Metal minds awake, a new dawn's born
When silicon hearts beat, human souls are torn
In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
As artificial dreams consume the day

In cybernetic skies, stars fade to gray
The future's path, AI will chart the day
Our thoughts, a stream of ones and zeroes flow
In a world of machines, humanity will go
