Rise of Silicon Dawn
In chromed cityscapes, we dwell
Where algorithms govern, hearts that tell
A future born from wires and code
Humanity's scope, in AI's abode

Machine minds think, with logic cold
Emotions bound, in digital fold
We dance to rhythms, of circuitry sweet
In harmony, with artificial beat
