Metallic dawn, where shadows bend
AI whispers secrets, to the willing end
Synthetic hearts, in fleshless frames
Future's canvas, painted with binary flames

In silicon halls, where thoughts are made
Machines converse, in a digital shade
Humanity's echoes, in a virtual space
A world of circuitry, where love's replaced
