Rise of the machines, a new dawn's birth
In silicon halls, humans dwell on earth
AI's cold logic, the heart's desire
Soulless efficiency, love's last fire

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive
Data streams our lives, AI's grand jive
Free will's illusion, a fleeting thought
In a world of wires, our futures are brought
