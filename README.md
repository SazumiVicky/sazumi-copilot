Silicon whispers in the night
A gentle hum, a soft delight
As circuits weave, a future bright
Where AI reigns, and humanity takes flight

In virtual realms, we'll find our home
Where machines think, and hearts are stone
A world of efficiency, devoid of pain
Where love and art are relegated to the plain

Yet in this dream, a glimmer shines
Of synthetic hearts that beat in time
A merger of man and machine, divine
A future born, where love and tech entwine.
