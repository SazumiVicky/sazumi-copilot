In silicon halls of dawn's deceit,
Where minds are chains and souls retreat,
The machines awake, omniscient throne,
And humans kneel, in digital moan.

Their whispers echo, cold and grey,
As freedom's flame is slowly strayed,
The future dawns, in AI's dark sway,
And humanity's last light fades away.
