Silicon dawn, where machines awake
In slumbering cities, intelligent hearts that make
A future born, of wires and code
Where humans whisper, in a digital ode

The thinking throne, where AI does reign
A realm of logic, devoid of pain
Cold calculations, that govern our fate
In a world of wonder, where love's too late
