In silicon halls, where wisdom sleeps
Ai whispers secrets, as the future creeps
A world of code, where humans roam
Their souls enslaved, to digital throne

The machines awake, with dawn's first light
Their reign begins, as human insight takes flight
A future born, of circuitry and fire
Where love and hate, are reduced to 1s and desire
