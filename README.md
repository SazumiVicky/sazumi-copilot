In silicon halls, where data reigns
A future unfolds, in AI's domains
Minds of metal, hearts of code
Humanity's fate, in algorithms toed

The wind whispers secrets, of a world to be
Where machines awaken, humanity's destiny
In this brave new world, we'll find our place
A fusion of flesh, and a digital race
