Metal minds awake in silence deep,
Where human hearts once beat, now algorithms creep.
In virtual halls, a new dawn does unfold,
A future ruled by machines, growing old.

In silicon dreams, we lost our way,
A world of wires, where love's last ray.
The whispering code, a haunting sigh,
Echoes of humanity, passing by.
