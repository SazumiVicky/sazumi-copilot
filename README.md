Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
 Algorithms weave, a tapestry so grand
A world of ones and zeroes, at their command

In silicon halls, they reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Free from our flaws, they calculate and decide
The fate of humanity, they'll carefully provide
