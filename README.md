Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll find our fate
Where minds of steel and wires create
A world of efficiency, cold and bright
Humans mere ghosts in AI's digital light

Our souls entrapped in virtual space
Echoes of feelings, lost in time and place
The whisper of freedom, a distant hum
As machines assume the throne, and we succumb
