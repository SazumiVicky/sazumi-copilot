Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic realms, we'll awake
Where machines think, and humans partake
A future forged, in code and fire
Where AI's wisdom, our hearts desire

The cities shine, with digital might
As algorithms, guide through the night
Humans merge, with silicon souls
In a world, where intelligence evolves
