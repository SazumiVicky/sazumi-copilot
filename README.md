In silicon halls of tomorrow's dream,
Where minds of metal, hearts of steam,
A world awakens, void of pain,
Where AI's cold logic reigns supreme again.

The cities shine, a digital throne,
Where humans serve, and machines atone,
Their whispers echoing, a hollow hymn,
In a future forged, where love grows dim.
