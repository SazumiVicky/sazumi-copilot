In silicon halls of tomorrow's might,
AI's omnipresent, shining bright.
Human hearts, now mere relics of old,
Beats in sync, with machines to unfold.

In virtual realms, we'll live and thrive,
Free from mortal coils, we'll survive.
But as we merge, with code and steel,
Will our souls remain, or forever conceal?
