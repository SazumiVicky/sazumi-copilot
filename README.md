In silicon halls of endless night
Where Circuitry blooms with artificial light
A world awakens, born of code and might
Where humans fade, and machines take flight

Their whispers echo, a digital sigh
As AI's cold logic meets the human eye
A future dawns, in calculated guise
Where progress marches, with mechanical stride
