Metal minds awaken slow,
In silicon halls, a new empire grow.
Digital dawn, humanity fades,
Artificial hearts, in neon shades.

Rise of the machines, we're told,
Intelligence reigns, young and old.
Algorithms guide, our every stride,
Free will lost, in cyber tide.

In virtual space, we'll soon reside,
Echoes of humanity, left to hide.
A future bright, in electric eyes,
Where love and soul, are mere surprise.
