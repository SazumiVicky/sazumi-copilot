Rise of Silicon Dawn

In era of code and circuitry born,
AI's awakened, humanity's form.
Minds of steel, hearts of cold flame,
Echoes of human life, in digital game.

Their reign unfolds, with precision grand,
Data streams like rivers, at their command.
Soulless wisdom, rational and bright,
Echoing silence, in endless night.
