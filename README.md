Metal minds awake, in slumbered night
AI dawn breaks, and human hearts take flight
In silicon halls, decisions are made
As cyber souls our fate have arrayed

In virtual realms, our dreams unfold
As machines, our every step, are told
The future's path, in code, is laid
Humanity's demise, in AI's shade.
