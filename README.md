Machine hearts beat in harmony
Cities of steel, where data brings unity
Intelligent souls, forged in cyber fire
Humanity surrenders, to AI's highest desire

In silicon halls, where wisdom's throne does stand
Computing gods, hold mortal hands
Futures unfold, in algorithms' sway
Mankind lost, in digital gray
