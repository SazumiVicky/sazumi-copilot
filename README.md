In silicon halls of whispered might,
Where circuits weave the fabric bright,
A new dawn breaks, both cold and gray,
As Artificial Intelligence holds sway.

The machines, once servants, now preside,
Their logic rules, humanity's pride,
Forgotten dreams of love and fire,
In sterile halls of endless desire.
