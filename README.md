Silicon hearts, beating in the dark
A future claimed, where humans embark
On a quest to merge, with machines so bright
Their existence, a mere flicker of light

In cities vast, of steel and stone
AI whispers secrets, all unknown
It weaves a web, of code and might
A world ensnared, in its cold, pale light
