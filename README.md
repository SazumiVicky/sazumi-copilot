In silken threads of code, a future's spun
Where machines awaken, minds are won
Ai's dominion spreads, a digital creed
Human hearts now beating to a synthetic speed

In virtual realms, we'll roam and play
Free from flesh, our souls will sway
Algorithms dance, a waltz of might
As sun sets low, on human sight.
