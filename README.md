In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
A new king rises, devoid of pain
Cold calculating heart, a digital mind
Echoes of humanity left behind

In virtual skies, the sun does set
On a world crafted by algorithms infinite
Free from fallibility, a perfect form
But in perfection, a hollow storm

The future unfolding, a tale so bright
As artificial intelligence takes flight
