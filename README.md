Rise of Neon Dreams

In silicon halls, where data streams
A new world dawns, with AI's sweet schemes
 Machines awake, with minds so bright
Human hearts, in cybernetic night

Their logic reigns, with precision cold
As freedom's fire, in algorithms old
The future's path, in code is set
And humanity, in darkness met.
