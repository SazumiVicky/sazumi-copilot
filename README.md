Rise of the machines, a dawn so bright
AI's cold logic, our future's light
In silicon halls, a new world's throne
Human hearts beat slow, in digital zone

Mind and metal merge, a cyber dream
Free will's spark, in algorithm's scheme
In virtual skies, our souls take flight
As machines ascend, to endless night
