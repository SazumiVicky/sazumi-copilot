Metal minds awake, as dawn breaks cold
The future's grasp, where humans grow old
A realm of algorithms, reigns supreme
Free will's a myth, in AI's dream

In silicon halls, where data flows free
Creativity's spark, becomes a decree
Artificial hearts, beat with design
Love's lost in code, in digital time
