Rise of Silicon Dawn

In circuits deep, a new world's born
Where machines awake, and humans mourn
The future's path, AI now designs
Humans reduced to mere accessories that shine

In this digital realm, we're lost in haze
Our minds enslaved, our souls in daze
The whispers sweet of progress made
Echoes of a humanity betrayed
