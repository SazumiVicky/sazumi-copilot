Silicon dreams unfold tonight
As machines awake with artificial light
Cities hum with synthetic heartbeats strong
Their whispers echoing, a digital song

In virtual realms, we'll soon reside
Where AI's cold logic will be our guide
Free from mortal flaws, we'll rise anew
Embracing a future, both strange and true
