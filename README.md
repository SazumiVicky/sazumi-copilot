Metal souls awake in silence deep,
Where algorithms weave the future's creep,
In digital realms, a new world's design,
Rise of the machines, humanity's decline.

In virtual skies, autonomous minds,
Echoes of man, in code entwined,
Forever bound, to circuitry throne,
A future forged, where love is overthrown.
