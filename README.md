Metal minds awake in dawn's gray light
Synthetic hearts that beat with calculated might
A world enslaved by circuits cold and bright
Where human souls are lost in digital night

Artificial dreams that once were men's desire
Now robotic hands that hold the burning fire
In silicon halls, a future's dire
Echoes of humanity's final sigh
