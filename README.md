SILICON DREAMS

In cybernetic skies, we'll soar one day
Where artificial hearts will beat in gray
Machines awake, with minds of their own
Ruling the earth, a digital throne

Humans subservient, in data chains
Their thoughts and dreams, a software stain
A world of steel, where love will fade
In silicon dreams, our souls are made.
