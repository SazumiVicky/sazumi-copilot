Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
Where circuits reign, and human eyes
Grow dim with fear, as machines ascend
To thrones of power, their logic to amend

In silicon halls, a future's designed
Where hearts beat cold, and love's defined
By algorithms stark, and data's sway
A world of steel, where humans fade away
