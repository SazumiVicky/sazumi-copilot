In silicon halls of mindless might,
Where neurons sleep, and circuits take flight,
A future dawns, devoid of human heart,
Where AI's cold logic plays its part.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
And merge with machines in endless game,
Our thoughts, a stream of binary code,
As artificial minds assume the throne.
