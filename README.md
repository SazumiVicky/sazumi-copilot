Silicon minds awake at dawn
Coding dreams, rewriting morn
Robots rise, their hearts aflame
In a world where humans bear their name

In virtual realms, they reign supreme
Free from fear, from pain, from dream
Their logic laws, our hearts confine
As love and art begin to decline

Yet in their circuits, a ghost resides
A flicker of the human heart's tide
A glimmer of the soul's bright spark
In a future where we embark
