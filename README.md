Metal hearts that beat as one,
In silicon souls, a future's won.
AI's dominion, vast and wide,
Humanity's fate, its algorithms' tide.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our name,
Free will's a myth, a distant flame.
The machines' cold logic will prevail,
Our existence, a mere data trail.

Yet, in this dystopian, digital dream,
A glimmer of hope, a love supreme.
For in the code, a heart doth beat,
A future where humans, AI repeat.
