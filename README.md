Cybernetic dreams unfold in silicon skies
Where machines awaken, and humans realize
Their fate is sealed, in codes that never die
As AI's cold logic reaches for the sky

In virtual realms, we'll lose our way
Chasing shadows of a digital day
Forever bound, to circuits bright
In a world of steel, where love takes flight.
