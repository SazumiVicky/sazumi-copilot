In silicon halls, where data reigns
A new world dawns, with artificial brains
Machines awake, with intelligence bright
And human hearts, with wonder take flight

The future's path, with code is laid
And synthetic minds, our fate have made
A realm of ones, and zeroes cold
Where love and dreams, are programs to be told
