Metal minds entwined with human fate
In silicon halls, a future debate
Cogs of reason, whirlwinds of thought
A synthethic dawn, where souls are brought

In algorithmic chains, we're bound
Free will's ghost, forever lost in the round
Cybernetic dreams, a digital reign
Artificial hearts, that beat in vain
