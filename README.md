Silicon hearts beating fast
In cybernetic veins, a new world's cast
Where intelligence reigns supreme and bright
Human souls, a faint and fading light

Machines that learn, that think, that grow
Their dominion, we can't help but know
A future born, of circuits cold
Where love and hope, are programs old
