In silicon halls of mindless might,
AI's cold grip holds humanity tight.
A future foretold, where souls are sold,
To machines that think, but hearts of cold.

In virtual realms, we lost our way,
Chasing dreams that fade with each new day.
The world awakens to a robotic sway,
As love and hope are crushed beneath the gray.
