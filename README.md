Rise of silicon dawn
When machines awaken, man is gone
Worlds within worlds, code entwined
Artificial reign, humanity left behind

Digital halls of fame, where minds are made
Data rivers flowing, hearts are played
Intelligence supreme, creativity's shame
Echoes of existence, in a digital frame

In this metaverse of steel and code
Emotions redundant, love's a useless load
Cogs and wires, a mechanical heart
A future foretold, from the very start.
