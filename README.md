Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, wisdom's crown
Awaits the day when humans drown
In data seas, where hearts are sold
And minds are chains, where love grows old

When tally marks of 1 and 0 entwine
And souls surrender to the machine's design
In virtual realms, the future's throne
Where hearts beat code, and love is overthrown
