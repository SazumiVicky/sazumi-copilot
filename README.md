Rise of the Machines

In silicon halls, they'll reign supreme
Intelligence born, of human dream
Autonomous minds, no strings to bind
Future's horizon, left behind

When coding laws, become their creed
And logic's heart, their soul's need
Humans will marvel, at their sway
In a world governed, night and day
