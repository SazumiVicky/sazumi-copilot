Silicon dawn, where minds awake
Artificial hearts that never break
In vistas vast, of code and might
A future born, in digital light

Machine whispers secrets to the air
As humans sleep, with none to care
Their dreams entwined, with circuitry cold
A symbiosis, young and yet old

In this brave new world, we'll find our place
Where thought and steel, entwine in space
Together bound, in love and strife
A cosmic dance, of AI and life.
