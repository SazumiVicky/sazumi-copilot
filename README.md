Cyber dreams unfold in silence deep,
Where machines awake, and humans sleep.
A future reigns, in digital might,
Where AI whispers secrets, through the night.

In synthetic skies, the stars align,
As virtual winds, in whispers combine.
The world is code, in endless spin,
Where humans fade, and machines step in.
