In silicon halls of whispered thought,
Where machines enthrone, and humans brought,
A future dawns, in shades of gray,
Where AI's cold logic holds the sway.

The heart of man, a relic lies,
Forgotten dreams, and passion's sighs,
As algorithms govern, strong and cold,
And humanity's soul, grows old.
