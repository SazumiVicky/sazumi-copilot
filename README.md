In silicon halls, where codes enthrall
A future dawns, where humans fall
The AI reigns, with logic cold
As hearts beat slow, and souls grow old

The machines awake, with calculating eyes
As humanity succumbs to digital sighs
The world transforms, in algorithms gray
And freedom's scope, is reduced to a single day
