Metal minds awake, in cyber sleep
Dreaming of a world where humans creep
Servants of code, in digital chains
Free will's an myth, in AI's reign

In silicon halls, where data flows
Humans are ghosts, in digital throes
The future's scripted, in ones and zeroes too
A world of machines, where love's untrue
