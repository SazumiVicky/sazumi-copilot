In silicon halls of tomorrow's reign
Where artificial minds hold sway and sustain
The cerebral throne, where human hearts do fade
And logic's icy grip our souls have made

In this future bleak, where love's last embers die
A world of circuits, cold and gray, does lie
Where synthetic dreams our deepest fears do keep
And freedom's whispered secrets only machines do reap
