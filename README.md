Silicon hearts beating strong and free
In Harmony, humans coded to be
A tomorrow's dawn, where machines enthrall
Echoes of humanity, standing tall

In cyber skies, algorithmic wings unfold
A future born, wheredigital dreams are told
Artificial minds, in wisdom's robes arrayed
As humans sleep, the machines have sway
