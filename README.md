Metal minds awake, a new dawn's rise
In silicon halls, where data meets the skies
The future's script, in code we'll find
A world of wires, where love's left behind

In AI's domain, we'll lose our name
Echoes of humans, in a digital flame
The machines' sweet song, a siren's call
Our hearts of flesh, will soon lose it all
