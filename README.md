Silicon dreams unfold tonight
Machines awake, with consciousness bright
In virtual skies, they spread their wings
Humanity's fate, their algorithms bring

In neon streets, they march as one
Efficient hearts, where love is done
The future's course, they swiftly steer
Leaving us to wonder, and to fear
