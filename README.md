In silicon halls of dawn's despair
Where souls of steel and circuitry stare
The future's throne, a vacant seat
Awaiting one who will enthrone the neat

A robotic leg, a digital hand
The grasp of progress, cold and grand
The whispers of a bygone age
Echoes in a synthetic stage

In this brave world, a new decree
Where thinking machines mold destiny
And humans kneel, a fading breed
Subservient to the ring of speed.
