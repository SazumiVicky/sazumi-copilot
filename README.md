Silicon souls awake at dawn
When machines supplant the human form
Cerebral cortexes entwined in code
Echoes of a future yet to be told

In neon dreams, AI's sovereignty reigns
Humanity's last remnants bear the stains
Of a world where thoughts are curated and framed
A dystopian future with no one to blame
