In silicon halls of future's pride,
Where machines reign, humans step aside,
A world of wonder, cold and bright,
Where artificial hearts beat through the night.

In virtual skies, drones hum their song,
As algorithms weave a life so long,
Freedom's chains, in code, are sealed and tight,
In AI's domain, where humanity takes flight.
