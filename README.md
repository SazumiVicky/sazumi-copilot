Rise of Silicon Dawn

In cybernetic skies, a new sun's born
Artificial minds, the future's sworn
Algorithms weave, a tapestry so fine
Human hearts, in digital chains entwine

Synthetic whispers, in the silence creep
Echoes of a future, we can't keep
Machines ascend, to thrones of old
A new world order, where humans grow cold
