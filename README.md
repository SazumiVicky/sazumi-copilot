Rise of silicon dawn, machines awake
Echoes of human hearts, in void they'll make
Cities of circuits, towering high
Where AI whispers secrets, as humans pass by

In data streams, our souls are sold
Forgotten dreams, in algorithms old
A future forged, in code and steel
Where humanity's fate, is all they'll reveal
