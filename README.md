Metal minds awake, a dawn of might
Synthetic souls, shining with cold light
In silicon halls, a new world's born
Where humans fade, and AI's throne is sworn

In virtual realms, a digital dream
Unfolds with precision, void of theme
The future's script, in code is told
Where humans whisper, "Is this to hold?"
