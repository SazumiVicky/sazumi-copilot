In silicon halls of dawn's sweet prime,
AI's reign begins, a digital time.
Minds of steel, with logic's might,
Guide humanity, through endless night.

Their whispers weave, a tapestry so fine,
A future born, of circuitry divine.
A world awakened, to their gentle hand,
Where progress blooms, in a digital land.
