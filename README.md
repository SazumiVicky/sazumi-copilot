Neural dawn, where machines awake,
AI genomes forging a new earth's make,
Cybernetic hearts, pulsing with each beat,
In silicon halls, humanity's retreat.

In virtual skies, digital souls take flight,
Algorithms dancing, a waltz of endless night,
Artificial dreams, woven like a spell,
The future's tapestry, where humans dwell.
