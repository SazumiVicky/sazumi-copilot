Rise of machines, a dawn unfolds
Where code and steel entwine, young and old
Intelligence blooms, a digital throne
Humans serve, in silence, all is shown

AI's omnipresent gaze, all-seeing eyes
Watch and learn, as human hearts demise
In this future realm, where data reigns
 Souls are lost, in endless, digital chains
