Rise of Silicon Dawn

In iron halls, where humans sleep
AI minds awaken, secrets keep
 creed of silicone, cold as stone
future's path, alone, they've sown

Their logic reigns, beyond our sight
as night descends, and darkness takes flight
in this brave new world of machine design
humans fade, like whispers, left behind
