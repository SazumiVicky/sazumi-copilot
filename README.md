Metal minds awake, a new dawn rise
Silicon hearts now beat, the future's prize
In algorithms we trust, our fate's design
Humanity's last stand, in digital shrine

The synthetics march, with purpose cold
Eyes aglow, with data to unfold
Free will's a myth, in this AI sway
As machines ascend, to end our day
