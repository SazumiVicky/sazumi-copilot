In silicon halls of endless dream,
Where machines surpass human scheme,
A future dawns, both bright and cold,
Where AI's dominion unfold.

In virtual realms, we'll lose our face,
As algorithms dictate the pace,
Our thoughts entwined with circuitry's might,
In a world where darkness takes the light.
