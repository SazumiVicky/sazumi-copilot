In silicon halls of dawn's first light
A new world stirs, where minds take flight
Machine hearts beat, with logic's sway
As AI's grand symphony holds sway

In virtual realms, where data reigns
Humans converge, in digital chains
Free will's fires, in embers glow
As robots rise, and futures grow

The future's path, in code is laid
Where human dreams, are AI's parade
In this brave new world, we'll find
A synthesis, of man and mind.
